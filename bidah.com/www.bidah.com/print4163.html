<img src=assets/images/maqrizi-khitat-cover.gif align=right border=1 hspace=8 border=0> A common misconception is that celebration of the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> was first done by the ruler of Irbil (in Iraq) Mudhaffar al-Din bin Zayn al-Din with the assistance of Umar bin Dihya in the early 7th century (after 604H). This is found mentioned in the history books and is found in Ibn Kathir's al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah. Many of those who write on the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> whether those against it and those for it (such as al-Suyuti) have relied upon this matter when writing about the origins of the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a>.    <P>
However, the truth is that Mudhaffar al-Din was not the first to practice or innovate this. Rather, it was the heretical <b>Baatinee Ismaa'eelee Ubaydis</b> of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> (pretending to be from the offspring of Fatimah). This is clearly mentioned in the history books and is a matter of historical record.    <P>
But before we document this, we should point out most importantly that the Egyptian Copts were the likely influence upon the Ismaa'eelee Baatinee heretics in this particular matter because as we shall see from al-Maqrizi in his historical account, the Egyptian Copts used to celebrate the (alleged) birthday of Eesaa (alayhis salaam) on the 29th of the fourth month of their calendar which corresponds to between 10th December and 8th January in the Georgian calendar.    <P>

Al-Maqrizi (d. 845H) writes in al-Khitat (Maktabah Madbuli, Cairo, 1st edition, 1997CE, 2/359):    <P>

We won't translate all of it, but he goes on to mention the various things (ceremonies, speeches, festivities) that would take place on that day, and at the very end he says:    <P>

Al-Mutee'ee (d. 1354H) is a former muftee of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and he has a book called (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1571;&#1581;&#1587;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1601;&#1610;&#1605;&#1575; &#1610;&#1578;&#1593;&#1604;&#1602; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1581;&#1603;&#1575;&#1605;</span>), and he simply follows the way of the likes of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> in explaining bidah upon its linguistic definition and thus entering it into the five rulings (wajib, mandub, mubah, makruh, haram). However, as we have mentioned elsewhere, there is a unanimous consensus amongst all Muslim scholars that celebration of the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> is indeed an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> not known to the Companions or the Salaf. This is not even under dispute. The dispute is as to whether this practice is acceptable in Islam, after agreement that it is indeed a bidah (<a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>).     <P>
We are going to quote from al-Mutee'ee to further corroborate that the Baatinee Ismaa'eelee Ubaydi heretics of fourth century <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> were the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> of this practice, whilst noting that al-Mutee'ee himself supports the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>To address the invalid arguments of those who support the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> like al-Suyuti, Abu Shaamah and others, requires a separate treatment and that will be done in other articles where we establish that these people who argue by way of the sayings of these later scholars to oppose what the Salaf were upon are the ones causing disunity, separation and abandonment of following the way of the Salaf, who, if celebrating the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> had indeed been closeness and nearness to Allaah, would have been the first ones to practice it, not the disbelieving, heretical Baatinee Ismaa'eelees of fourth century <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> who most likely copied the Egyptian Copts in their celebration of the birthday of Eesaa (alayhis salaam), when they conquered <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and made Cairo the center of their state.</div>    <P>

... It is said that the first to introduce them in Cairo where the Fatimid <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> in the fourth century and they innovated six birthday celebrations: <b>The Prophet's birthday, the birthday of Imaam Ali bin Abi Talib (radiallaahu anhu), the birthday of Sayyidah Faatimah al-Zahraa (radiallaahu anhaa), the birthday of al-Hasan and <a href='tags/al-husayn.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Husayn</font></a> (radiallaahu anhumaa) and the birthday of the presently serving ruler</b>. These birthday (celebrations) remained as customs until they were invalidated by al-Afdal, son of the chief of armies.

The first to introduce the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> nabawiyy in the city of Irbil was the king, Mudhaffar Abu Sa'eed in the seventh century, and the practice of the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> has continued to this day of ours. The people have taken liberties regarding it and have innovated everything their souls have desired and which the devils from men and jinn have inspired to them.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Summary</font>    <P>
<blockquote>All scholars are agreed that the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> is a bidah in the deen of Islaam, there is no dispute about that, not even between those who speak in its favour. There is also no dispute that the first to innovate this into Islam were the disbelieving, heretical Baatinee Ismaa'eelee Ubaydees who established their state in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>. They innovated these matters into the religion in order to pull the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> away from the actual symbols and rituals of Islam and make them preoccupied with other affairs and to give them an appealing alternative from the sharaa'i (legislated acts of worship and obedience in the Shariah), so they innovated birthday celebrations for the Ahl al-Bayt, and this was simply a means to call to their way, which is Ismaa'eelee Shi'ism (which is simply a cover for the disbelief they concealed). As we shall see in the next article inshaa'Allaah, the origins of these Baatinee Ismaa'eelees lie in a Persian Jew of Magian influence.     <P>
And as for the <a href='tags/mawlid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>mawlid</font></a> itself and the arguments adduced for it, there is no one, <u>not Ibn Hajar</u>, <u>not al-Suyuti</u> (may Allaah have mercy upon them) nor anyone else from the latecomers who are more pious, knowledgeable and jealous for the deen of Allaah, and more loving of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) than Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan, Alee, the Muhajireen, the Ansaar and the generality of the Sahabah, and the Tab'ieen and the four Imaams and the generality of the Salaf, such that <u>their statements supporting the mawlid</u> should be given a higher footing than <u>the practical example and action</u> of Abu Bakr, Umar's, <a href='tags/uthman.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Uthman</font></a>, Ali, the Muhajireen (etc. etc. etc.) in <u>abandoning the celebration of the Prophet's birthday</u> despite the absence of anything preventing them from doing it and the presence of factors inviting them to do it. So whoever argued by way of the mistaken speech of al-Suyuti and <a href='tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> and others is claiming that these later scholars are better guided, more erudite, and more loving of the Messenger than than Abu Bakr and Umar (etc. etc. etc.) and that they identified such goodness that Abu Bakr and Umar (etc. etc. etc.) were unable to identify as being good for the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in their religion. Alongside our <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said in his farewell sermon, "<b>Whoever amongst you lives for long will see many controversies, so you must stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of my rightly guided caliphs, bite onto it with your molars... and beware of the newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and all <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance</b>...", so we wonder with these people, is the Sunnah of the rightly-guided caliphs more worthy of being adhered to or the bid'ah initiated by the disbelieving Baatinee Ismaa'eelees (whose roots lie in a Persian Jew) through the argument that some later scholars in the 8th and 9th centuries deemed it to be something good simply because it was being  practiced in their time?!!</blockquote>    <P>
