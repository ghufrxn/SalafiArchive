<font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background</font>    <P>
We have firmly established that the scholars distinguish between the <u>linguistic usage</u> of the term bidah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) and the <u>Shariah usage</u> of the term bidah, and we have also explained that whenever any Scholar has used the word bidah in a praiseworthy way, it is being used strictly in its linguistic sense and not the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense. This was established from <a href='tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexadb8.html?ezaqa>in this article</a>) and likewise Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali.    <P>
We also clarified in <a href=index6c1a.html?edofk>the previous article</a>, that there is absolutely nothing in al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam's classification of bidah into wajib (obligatory), mandub (recommended) and mubah (permissible) which allows or which shows that he intended it to allow <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> into matters of worship. For reminder's sake, we will repeat that here, because it is necessary for what is to follow in this article:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Let's take a quick look at illustrative examples given by al-Izz once again and this was cited from al-Izz by Imam al-Shatibee in his book <i>al-I'tisaam</i> (1/319 onwards):    <P>
<ul><li> <u>Waajib (obligatory)</u>: <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of grammar (to preserve the religion], clarifying obscure, strange words used in revealed texts, compiling and laying down foundations of jurisprudence (fiqh), speech in criticism and appraisal of the narrators to distinguish sound from weak narrations, refuting the innovations.  <li> <u>Muharram (unlawful)</u>: the beliefs of the factions of innovations like the Qadariyyah, <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a> and others.  <li> <u>Mandub (recommended)</u>: setting up hospices, schools, dams (or other structures for irrigation), every instance of goodness that was not found routinely in the first era (of Islam), the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, speaking about the detailed affairs of that tasawwuf which is praiseworthy, debate and discussion and gathering to discuss issues, where only Allah's face is sought.  <li> <u>Makruh (disliked)</u>: decorating mosques, and decorating the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>.  <li> <u>Mubah (permitted)</u>: <a href='tags/shaking-hands.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>shaking hands</font></a> after the morning and late afternoon prayers, taking pleasure in <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, drink, clothing and residence, wearing shawls and widening the sleeves.  </ul>    <P>
We are concerned only with the wajib, mandub and mubah, since that is what todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> are attached to.     <P>
<blockquote>As for the <b>waajib (obligatory)</b> these are all clearly from the masaalih mursalah (non-Shariah defined matters of broad <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> as it relates to one of the five necessities, in this case, preservation of religion). This has nothing to do with innovating in matters of worship (ta'abbud) or justifying the departure from the Sunnah in the form and detail of worship. As for the <b>mandub (recommended)</b> we can again see that these come under the topic of the maslahah mursalah, and as for the example of the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, then that has a very specific proof in the Sunnah because it was done by the Messenger (alayhis salaam). For someone to innovate a new act of worship or to practice an existing one in a way that is different to what is in the Sunnah, one must bring a specific proof. As for the <b>mubah (permitted)</b>, then these are merely matters which are permitted in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> (shaking hands, eating <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, wearing clothes) [and are not from the affairs of worship] but they are being performed in a new way (i.e. with something of excess compared to previuosly). This has got nothing to do with matters of worship (ibaadah) which the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> try to justify, which are opposed to the Sunnah in either their foundation, or their details. </blockquote></div>    <P>
We also established in <a href=index6c1a.html?edofk>the previous article</a> through five or six fatawa of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, that there is strong indication of a general spirit that is different to what the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> of today are upon, who wrongly use his classification of bidah to justify departure and opposition to the Sunnah and introduction of innovations which have no basis at all in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, or which have a basis but which differ in their details and particulars from what is in the Sunnah.    <P>
These <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have a vague and generalized form of argument (after a wrong reading of this classification by the likes of al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam) which is as follows:    <P>
<blockquote><font style='font-size:17px;'>If something has a foundation in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, then it is not counted as a blameworthy <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> but is a praiseworthy <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>.</font></blockquote>    <P>
In such a broad and vague way, these innnovators try to pull the wool over the eyes of many unsuspecting general <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who sincerely wish to follow the Messenger (alayhis salaam) but are drawn instead towards innovated matters for which Allah sent down no authority and which neither the Messenger nor his Companions practised. They make the above statement to appear as if it is in agreement with what certain Scholars have stated, but those Scholars do not in fact intend what these <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> intend.    <P>
The  aim of this article then, by Allaah's permission, is to pound and smash this argument and what better way to do it than use the writings of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> himself! Abject <a href='tags/humility.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>humility</font></a> for today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> who misuse his words and misrepresent his intent for their own falsehood!    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Imporant Note:</b> <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> himself is a Sufi Ash'ari and has much for which he can be criticised. Our citation of him here is from the angle of identifying and clarifying the truth that is found with a person even though he  may have errors in other areas. Further, there are people today who often ascribe themselves to past figures like <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, and to certain of their statements, making deceptive use of them, when those figures never intended those statements the way these later <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have twisted and employed them for their own ends.</div>     <P>
So please sit back, watch decades of <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> and treachery destroyed in less than ten minutes, by Allaah's permission. Enjoy and rejoice!    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Debates Between <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and Ibn al-Salah Regarding the Innovated Salat al-Raghaa'ib</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bidah-musajalah-izz-cov.gif align=right hspace=6 border=1 border=0> In the seventh century hijrah (after 600H) a written debate took place between <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> (d. 660H) and Ibn al-Salah (d. 643H). It is related that al-Izz, when he took occupation of leadership and giving sermons ended many of the innovations that the khatibs and common people were upon (Tabaqat al-Shafi'iyyah al-Kubra 5/80) and from those affairs was the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> called <i>Salat al-Ragha'ib</i>, and he explained that it is <b>an evil innovation</b>.    <P>
This raises a very important and helpful situation which is that as there is <b>a great dispute</b> between the true followers of the Sunnah, the followers of the Righteous Salaf and those grave-worshipping Sufis of today [who make lip-service in their claim of following the Messenger (alayhis salaam)] about the understanding and application of term "bidah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>)", then we find here <b>a great acid test</b> to find out the truth from the falsehood and the genuine from the fake. Since, these <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> claim attachment to <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, and in particular his classification of bidah (into wajib, mandub, mubah), then what better way to distinguish between what he actually means by it and how todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> twist it except by taking an actual <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> he himself refuted so we can see <u>his particular understanding and application</u> of the word bidah in action in broad daylight, such that there can not be any dispute or argument thereafter at all.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/acid-test-kit.jpg align=right border=0> So we have our <b>acid-test kit</b> ready, and we await for the great moment of truth. We advise all readers (those who have been misled or who hold on to doubts) to put aside all whims and desires and accept the truth when it becomes clear and to <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> the perversion of the heart, for when one deliberately and obstinately rejects the truth which stares him in the face, Allaah causes his heart to become perverse and misguided and make him blind to the truth.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>What is Salat al-Ragha'ib</font>    <P>
This is an innovated form of <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> which involves many repetitions of certain Surahs (Surah al-Ikhlas and Surah al-Qadr) and certain remembrances in twelve rakahs at the end of which there are two prostrations (after the tasleem). It is supposed to be done on a Friday night, preferably in the month of Rajab, preferably when one has been fasting and performed just prior to breaking one's fast. This was being practised by the people in the time of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, and it was found in popular books such as Iyha Ulum al-Din of al-Ghazali. So he wrote a tract in refutation of it. Ibn al-Salah had a different view and considered it an acceptable ibadah (act of worship) and so he wrote a defence of it by writing against al-Izz's tract. Al-Izz then wrote another response and refuted Ibn al-Salah.  Now al-Izz was not the only one who rejected it, it was also rejected by  Abu Shaamah Shihab al-Din al-Maqdisi (d. 665H), Abu al-Khair <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> al-Din Muhammad al-Zubaydi (894H), Abu Bakr al-Turtushi, Ali bin Ibraheem al-Attaar, <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, Zakariyaa al-Ansari and others.    <P>
This debate has been referred to bin al-Yaafi'ee in Mar'aat al-Janaan (5/144):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There occurred between him (al-Izz) adn the Shaikh of Dar al-Hadith, the Imaam Abu Amr bin al-Salah very severe, intense disputations about that (the prayer) and each of them wrote in refutation of the other. And the investigating (scholars) judged the position of the Imam Ibn Abd al-Salam to be correct, and they testified for him with manifestation of the truth and correctness in those [raging] wars and battles.</blockquote>    <P>
A manuscript  of these written debates is present and dated 712H being written by Ahmad bin Yahya bin Basharah, they comprise of three tracts (al-Izz's first tract, then Ibn al-Salah's refutation, then al-Izz's counter refutation). The manuscript also contains a fatwa of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> in this very matter. Al-Subki also cites the first tract of al-Izz in his Tabaqat al-Shafi'iyyah al-Kubraa (5/105-107) but it is deficient and not complete. These are pictures of the first title pages of the initial tract of al-Izz and the response by Ibn al-Salah.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-mscript.jpg width="100%" border=0>    <P>
The three tracts together are very valuable and should really be translated fully, however, because that is outside the scope of this article, we are going to make a summarization of the essential points, and where certain statements are crucial, we will translate them and refer to the relevant page number in the published version.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam's First Tract</font>    <P>
Before continuing, please remember that vague, deceptive slogan used by the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>, "If something has a foundation in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, then it is not counted as a blameworthy <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> but is a praiseworthy innovation" in order to confuse and deceive the people, and watch it dissolve and disappear like salt in water, as you read on. Al-Izz begins (p. 3) by explaining that <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is of three types:     <P>
<blockquote><div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'>This is on the opening page:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p03.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
We will give a summary translation of it here:    <P>
<b>First:</b> That which is <i>mubah</i> (permissible) such as taking liberties in foods, drinks, clothing and marriage. He says there is no harm in this. It is clear from this that he has simply referred to matters which have the ruling of being mubah in the Shari'ah but with respect to which some excess is found, an innovated type not found before, and in this there is no harm he says. Clearly, there is no sanction here for any type of <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in worship. <b>Second:</b> That which he says is <i>hasan</i> (good) and which he says is (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1603;&#1604; &#1605;&#1576;&#1578;&#1583;&#1593; &#1605;&#1608;&#1575;&#1601;&#1602; &#1604;&#1602;&#1608;&#1575;&#1593;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1601; &#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1569; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1575;</span>) "every innovated thing which is in agreement with the priniciples of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, not opposing any of them." Then he gives examples such as the tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. This in reality is not an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, because it has a precedence in the Sunnah, the Messenger prayed it in congregation in the mosque. But, leaving this aside, which has its own explanation  as indicated, it is interesting to note what he gives as examples for this type. He mentions (p. 4)  building hospices, schools and other deeds of goodness which were not found in the very first period, and which are in agreement with the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> in terms of the principles of cooperation upon piety and righteousness. Likewise, being occupied with the <a href='tags/arabic.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arabic</font></a> language, which is innovated, but without which the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> cannot be reflected upon, and understanding its meanings. He says that innovating this is in agreement with the command to reflect upon the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and understand its meanings. Likewise, compiling the hadeeth, dividing them into that which is hasan, sahih, mawdu', da'if, that this is a <a href='tags/good-innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a> because it preserves the speech of the Messenger (alayhis salaam) from anything which is not from it, or that something should be expelled from it which is from it. Likewise, laying down the principles and foundations of fiqh (jurisprudence), all of these examples are innovated affairs which are in agreement with the foundations of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> and do not oppose anything from them. <b>Third:</b> He says (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1575; &#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1605;&#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1575; &#1604;&#1604;&#1585;&#1588;&#1593; &#1571;&#1608; &#1605;&#1604;&#1578;&#1586;&#1605;&#1575; &#1604;&#1605;&#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1593;</span>) "<i>that which is in opposition to the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> or necessitates  [falling into] opposition to the Shariah</i>." Pay attention to this as it is important. He says that entering into this category is the Salat al-Ragha'ib. And he explains (pp. 4-5) that this is for two reasons, the first that it is fabricated and a lie upon the Messenger (alayhis salaam) and secondly because (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1607;&#1610; &#1605;&#1593; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1605;&#1582;&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1577; &#1604;&#1604;&#1585;&#1588;&#1593; &#1605;&#1606; &#1608;&#1580;&#1608;&#1607;</span>) "<i>alongside that, it opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> from numerous angles</i>..."    <P>
He then explains (pp. 5-6) that it opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> from numerous angles, some of which are connected to the Scholars and others which are connected to the common-folk. Those which are connected to the Scholars are of two types: a) that when a scholar prays this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> he makes the common folk think it is from the Sunnah, hence, by his action, he is lying upon the Messenger (alayhis salaam), and action can take the place of the tongue, b) that when a scholar prays it he is causing the common-folk to lie upon the Messenger (alayhis salaam) by them saying that it is from the Sunnah, and lying upon the Messenger is not permissible. As for what relates to the common-folk, he  mentions <u>eleven angles</u> altogether, most of which relate to supporting the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> in their innnovations, opposing the Sunnah, opposing khushoo (in the prayer). Of significance though is what he mentions is in angle eight, as it relates to the two prostrations that are said to be from this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> after the tasleem (salutations):    <P>

This dismantles that spurious, vague argument which we are demolishing in this article, as is clear to anyone with a sincere heart. A little later, al-Izz says (p. 9):    <P>

This is exactly what Ahl al-Sunnah say about a large number of the innovations practiced by today's Sufi grave and saint worshippers. So things should be coming more and more clearer now... and a page later, al-Izz drops <b>a bombshell</b> on the contemporary swindler, when he says (p. 10):    <P>

This is the essence of the first tract of <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and we can make some quick observations and points here:    <P>

Rather, they are referring only to affairs which come under <a href='tags/al-maslahah-al-mursalah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-maslahah al-mursalah</font></a> - a matter of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a>, that is not specifically mentioned in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, but which is supported and comes under the general principles of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> and its goals of preserving the five necessities (life, religion, intellect, wealth and lineage). <b>Second:</b> That those who employ this phrase, "good <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1587;&#1606;&#1577;</span>)" to refer to an action which actually has a basis in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, like congregational tarawih <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in the mosque, then they are using this phrase (<a href='tags/good-innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>)  purely in its <u>linguistic sense</u>, and these affairs can never be called "good innovations (<a href='tags/bidah-hasanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah hasanah</font></a>)" from a <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> point of view. <b>Third:</b> Proof that <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> is refuting what enters into a <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (relative innovation), that which from one aspect has a basis in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> but which from other aspects differs and opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> in its details and particulars.

In fact, al-Izz applied the saying of the Messenger "<i>The most evil of affairs are the newly-invented ones, and every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is miguidance</i>" to this innovated <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, despite it having a basis in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> (in the sense that <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> itself is from the Shariah). <b>Fourth:</b> All of the above shows clearly that when al-Izz classifies bidah into wajib (obligatory), mandub (recommended) and mubah (permissible) he did not intend it in the way today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> have misappropriated it for their own ends. It looks like they have merely taken the wording of his classification, and thrown away the actual meaning and intent. Then through that mere wording, they have proceeded to deceive the common-folk.

<font class='titleHeadline'>Ibn al-Salah's Refutation of <a href="tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a></font>    <P>
It is crucial for us to document Ibn al-Salah's rebuttal before we go on to mention al-Izz's counter-response, because it really helps us to <b>drive the stake into the argument</b> of the contemporary <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>. We will simply summarize the response as concisely as possible, but will document the crucial elements by direct citation.    <P>
<blockquote><div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'>Ibn al-Salah's rebuttal is comprised of a response to an answer posed to him. He brings many points and we list them here:     <P>
<b><u>ONE:</u></b> He first makes the point that trying to repeal this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> by the argument that the hadeeth is weak or fabricated, and going to great lengths in this regard to warn the people from it is such that Allaah has made an example of such a person by His saying, "<b>Have you seen him who prevents the slave, when he prays?... Do not obey him but indeed prostrate!</b>" (96:9-19).    <P>
<b><u>TWO:</u></b> He argues that this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> has become common and widespread amongst the people, he admits it only started around the fourth century, and that the hadeeth regarding it is indeed weak, or fabricated, and that just because it is weak, it does not mean that this particular <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> itself is invalid.  </div></blockquote>    <P>
Pay attention now, this is where it get's interesting:    <P>
<blockquote><div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'><b><u>THREE:</u></b> Ibn al-Salah then says:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p16.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Further, the weakness of the hadith does not necessitate the invalidity of Salat al-Ragha'ib, and preventing from it, because it enters into the unrestricted command which comes in the Book and the Sunnah, the unrestricted [command] for <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. Hence, it is recommended (mustahabbah) on account of the generality of the abundant texts of the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> which speak with the recommendation of <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> (in an unrestricted sense) and from them is what we have narrated from Sahih Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)  said, "<i>Prayer is light</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
Then he goes on to quote the hadeeth, "... <i>know that the best of your deeds is the prayer</i>" and after this he cites another hadeeth as support. This hadeeth turns out to be weak, but it is interesting to see how Ibn al-Salah uses it as evidence, the hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi (who actually does indicate its weakness) from Aaishah (radiallaahu anhaa) that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever prayed twenty rakahs after Maghrib, Allaah will make a house in Paradise for him</i>." Ibn al-Salah argues that since this has been specified between Maghrib and Isha, al-Salat al-Ragha'ib therefore enters into it, and likewise because al-Salat al-Ragha'ib is twelve rakahs, it therefore enters into this hadith! Then he says that all the other particular details and descriptions (meaning the surahs which are recited, and how many times and so on) represent a type of variation and specificity that do not prevent it from coming under this hadeeth or the general command to <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. Then pay attention to what he says next:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p18.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And how many an accepted <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> is there comprising of a particular description whose description has not been related in a specific text in the Book or Sunnah, it is not said (regarding it), "It is a bidah (innovation" and if someone was to say it is a bidah, he ought to say alongside it that <b>it is a <a href='tags/bidah-hasanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah hasanah</font></a> (<a href='tags/good-innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>) due to it returning back to a foundation from the Book or the Sunnah</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Just stop and pause here for a minute or two, about the significance of what is going on here. Basically, Ibn al-Salah is laying down all those types of arguments which todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> use to justify their innovations in worship! He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from the examples of this is that if a person was to pray during the night with fifteen rakahs followed by a single tasleem only, and he read a verse from fifteen surahs, all in succession, making a specific dua in each rakah, then this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> would be accepted, not rejected, and it is not for anyone to say, "This <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> is innovated, rejected because there has not been related any text from the Book or Sunnah with such a description (for it)."</blockquote>    <P>
Again, you need to stop right here and reflect upon the great significance of what is going on here! Look at the form of argumentation. He then says:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p19.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And if a hadith was fabricated for it (i.e. this example he just gave of a particular form of prayer) with a chain of narration by which it was related, we would have invalidated the hadith and rejected it, yet we would not have rejected the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. And such is the affair for al-Salat al-Ragha'ib, without any difference, and Allaah knows best.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> After this, Ibn al-Salah address the objections related to the particular details of this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> and he makes around six points aimed at justifying the details of the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. He addresses the issues of <u>a)</u> repetition of certain specified Surahs,  <u>b)</u> the two isolated prostrations after the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>,  <u>c)</u> the requirement of a fixed number in terms of repetition of surahs and remembrances,  <u>d)</u> that the amount of repetitions and remembrances required is burdensome,  <u>e)</u> that it is done in congregation. He responds to each of these by providing evidence to explain them away (these arguments are all weak and will be refuted by al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam). Then comes the sixth one and this is again very significant and crucial so we will document it here and look at Ibn al-Salah's response to it:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p25.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>The sixth:</b> That this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> has become an newly-arisen openly proclaimed symbol (of the religion) and it is prohibited to manifest an open symbol in the religion.    <P>
<u>And its answer is:</u> That the issue in that regard returns back to the fact that it is an act of worship which has a foundation in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, which has become open, manifest and people's aspirations for it have become much. This does not necessitate that the good spirit around it should be killed off by tearing it out from its very root. This is because what the Scholars of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> specialise in of the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of fiqh (jurisprudence) and all other sciences of the religion, of laying down foundations, and making clarifications, and comprehensively addressing matters, and giving attention to detail, and authoring works, and teaching, all of these are open manifest and newly-arising symbols in the religion which were not present at the beginning of Islam. So why don't we say, "That is innovated and it should be avoided and any newly-introduced symbol ought to be rooted out" - and Allaah knows best.</blockquote>    <P>
<u>Pay attention again to this form of argument and compare it with what is found with todays Innovators</u> and just wait and see till you read al-Izz's response, and when you have, then you will realize what great fraud has been perpetrated by today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and how <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> himself is free of these individuals, even if he himself is an Ash'ari Sufi with much for which he is to be refuted and criticized. This was the last of what Ibn al-Salah wrote and then his tract comes to an end, where he remarks:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So it has become clear with what we have explained and laid down that Salat al-Ragha'ib is not to be put aside the rejected innovations! And that the newly-invented affairs have many different [but] resembling facets, whoever does not distinguish (between them) will be putting them (alongside innovation) without insight!! And Allaah, the Most High knows best.</blockquote></div>  </blockquote>    <P>
We can now make summary points and observations here:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> His acknowledgement that the ahaadeeth with respect to this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> (Salat al-Ragha'ib) are weak or fabricated (he tends to the latter view). <b>Second:</b> His use of non-specific generalized texts that speak of the virtues of <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> as evidence for a specific act of worship with specific details and particulars having no mention in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, and declaring it to be mustahabb on account of those general texts. <b>Third:</b> His claim that this newly-introduced act goes back to an act of worship which has a basis (asl) and support in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>. <b>Fourth:</b> Ibn al-Salah is a great scholar and we excuse him for the mistakes in this regard because this matter became confusing for him, and it may have been the case that since the people were attached to this worship, if they were to be discouraged from it they would lose a significant attachment to the religion, and Allaah knows best. In any case, of utmost importance to us, is the arguments he used to defend this practice, which are echoed in the arguments of today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
This now leads us to the counter-response of al-Izz bin Abd al-Salaam, and here we will see the deceptions and frauds of todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> pounded back into the dust from whence they came, and of no avail is it to them to rely purely upon the wording and labelling of al-Izz's classification of bidah (into wajib, mandub and mubah) whilst throwing away or concealing the intended meaning and intent of al-Izz.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam's Counter-Response</font>    <P>
Please take a seat and watch as the fraud of the likes of GF Haddad, Faqir, your Abu Layths, your Kellers and others from the generality of the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> is laid bare and buried beneath the ocean, walhamdulillaah. So here is al-Izz's counter response, we will summarize it and any crucial parts will be documented:    <P>
<blockquote><div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'>    <P>
The opening of his response:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p29.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... to proceed: In praise of Allaah, besides whom there is none worthy of worship, and prayers upon His Prophet Muhammad and his family. When I had shown rejection against the fabricated Salat al-Ragha'ib and explained its opposition to the legislated Sunnahs from the angles which I had mentioned in my comments upon that, some of the people sprung up to oppose that, striving to declare it (the prayer) to be good, corroborating it and desiring to put it alongside the "good innovations (al-bida' al-hasana) from the angle that it is <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. <b>But I rejected it on account of the sum whole of its characteristics and particular details, some of which necessitate prohibition (in the Shariah) <u>and some of them necessitate opposition to the Sunnah</u></b>.

Here is solid proof that al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam's classification of bidah into wajib (obligatory), mandub (reccommended) and mubah (permitted) was not intended by him to enable the justification <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> in the religion through the argument that what is being done of the innovated worship has a basis and support in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>. Rather, as we have already established at the beginning of this article by analyzing the particular examples given by al-Izz for each of the wajib, mandub and mubah categories, it is clear he is speaking of something else entirely (which comes under the topic of al-maslahah al-mursalah). After this al-Izz starts to address some of the arguments of Ibn al-Salah:    <P>
He explains (p. 30) that the argument that the <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> is common and widespread amongst the people means that he (Ibn al-Salah) is using as proof the custom of those who have no <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> or proof in their actions of doing what is a prohibited <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>. He clarifies that using the verse in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> "<b>Have you seen him who prohibits a servant when he prays</b>" (96:9-10), this is distortion of the Book of Allaah, because this is referring to Abu Jahl prohibiting the Messenger from an obligatory <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, yet prohibiting this Salat al-Ragha'ib is prohibiting a <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> that the Messenger (alayhis salaam) prohibited, and thus upon his saying, it is the Messenger who is "preventing a servant when he prayers." Then al-Izz says, <u>and these words are for us</u>, the followers of the Sunnah and the followers of the Salaf, <u>a mighty unsheathed sword striking the necks of the contemporary saint-worshipping heretics</u>:    <P>

<blockquote><b>COMMENT:</b> Allahu Akbar! You have to truly appreciate what has happened here.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/bidah-nuclear-blast.gif align=right width="100%" border=0> As your GF Haddads, Kellers, Abu Layths, Faqirs, Naruijis and others <u>slowly hurtle back to the earth</u> with their doubts, lies and frauds, sent into orbit (<u>in another galaxy that is</u>), we'll explain  it to you:     <P>
It has become clear that what <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> refers to as <u>al-bidah al-hasanah</u> is <b>whatever is in agreement with the Sunnah in its <u>foundation</u> and its <u>details</u></b>, and this shows that al-Izz rejects the <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (that which has a foundation in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> from one aspect, but opposes it in others). What these people have been doing for time is deceiving the common folk by the mere fact that these scholars have used these terms, but without them being honest and explaining exactly what these Scholars mean by these terms and phrases. <b>That can only be known when we look at their speech where they are refuting an instance of an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> they consider to be evil and rejected</b>. This then allows us to truly understand what they mean and what they do not mean by the terms and phrases they have employed.</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote><div style='border:1px solid #ababab;padding:10 10 10 10;'> Then al-Izz addresses the general hadeeths used by Ibn al-Salah to justify Salat al-Ragha'ib. He says (p. 32) that the two hadeeths "<i>Prayer is light</i>" and "<i>Know that the best of your deeds is the prayer</i>" this is only applicable to every <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> which does not come under a prohibition, and as for anything that comes under a prohibition, it cannot be said to be light and nor the best of deeds. As for the third hadeeth (from al-Tirmidhi) which mentions, "<i>Whoever prayers twenty rakahs between Maghrib and Isha, Allaah will build a house for him in Paradise</i>", al-Izz points out that in its chain is a liar, fabricator called Ya'qub bin al-Walid al-Madani. And as for Ibn al-Salah bringing Salat al-Ragha'ib under this hadeeth, al-Izz says this is not correct, even if the hadeeth was authentic.    <P>
After this, al-Izz addresses a number of the other arguments of Ibn al-Salah from them that any prayers which are introduced and which have particular characteristics are not to be rejected (because they have a broad support in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> and come under generalized texts). Al-Izz points out the differences between the Salat al-Ragha'ib and the example of praying tahajjud by reciting particular verses and shows that an analogy cannot be made between them both to justify an innovated form of worship which differs with the Sunnah in its details.    <P>
Then al-Izz makes some important points about some of the necessities Ibn al-Salah tried to impose upon the one who rejects the Salat al-Ragha'ib, and from them is his saying:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p36.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And as for his saying regarding the two prostrations (that come after the end of this particular prayer) in the view of those who consider it to be disliked, that a person (upon that view) should just leave them (and perform Salat al-Ragha'ib without them), then this is not correct <b>because the rejection has been shown upon the Salat al-Ragha'ib with its particular details (khasaa'is), and what follows it and is attached to it</b>. And rejecting the whole composition (of this prayer) does not necessitate the rejection of some of its individual parts.</blockquote>    <P>
He explains here that it is the actual form  (kaifiyyah) of this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> that is being rejected, and rejecting it does not necessitate that whatever individual components it may be made up of are rejected from their very foundations. In other words, reciting the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> is from the Sunnah, prostrating is from the Sunnah, remembrance is from the Sunnah. These are all components of this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>, but by rejecting this innovated <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> with its specific composition, we are not rejecting the individual components, as in, their being from the religion. After this, al-Izz addresses some more doubts related to praying this <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> in congregation, and then he makes another important point of refutation in which he makes an important distinction and by which we can also be more clear about what exactly he intends by the innnovations which are obligatory (as per his classification mentioned earlier). He says (p. 38):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-izz-musajalah-p38.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for him resembling this (innovated) <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> with what the jurists have introduced of laying down the foundations of jurisprudence, and its subsidiary branches, and speech about its realities and details, then this is not valid <b>because we have already explained that Salat al-Ragha'ib is prohibited from the angles already mentioned</b>, so how can an analogy be made between that for which a prohibition in the Sunnah is authentic and between that upon which there is a consensus that it is commanded?!</blockquote>    <P>
This again is <u>very important</u> because we see here a clear illustration of what <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> intends by the bidah that is waajib (obligatory). He is in reality speaking of the matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (maslahah mursalah) as  previously explained and his use of the word bidah in that context is from the linguistic aspect only, not from the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> aspect. This further demolishes the fraud of todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> even further. And another crucial statement which makes this even more clear is what follows just after (p. 38):    <P>

<blockquote><b>COMMENT:</b> This "<a href="tags/wahhabi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Wahhabi</font></a>"! Where is he getting all these answers to reject bidah?!

The <b>first type</b> <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> is speaking of refers to that which opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> and Salat al-Ragha'ib would come under it just as anything else which opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> in its details would come under it even if it has support in its basis, foundation as is clear.

It's time to clean up the debris:    <P>
<blockquote><b>First:</b> <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> has shown rejection against an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in his time upon the same usool (foundations) that Ahl al-Sunnah show rejection against all innovations which may have a basis in their foundations in the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, but which opposes the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> in the details and particulars, this is what is called <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (relative innovation). <b>Second:</b> He refuted the arguments of Ibn al-Salah, which are the very arguments used today and which are, very ironically, justified by todays <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> because they claim that certain scholars have spoken of "good bidah (<a href='tags/bidah-hasanah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah hasanah</font></a>)" or "praiseworthy bidah (bidah mahmudah)" - terms they clearly have not understood in the least. <b>Third:</b> A very clear explanation of exactly what al-Izz means by "<a href="tags/bidah-hasanah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">bidah hasanah</font></a>" and it is not what today's <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> claim it is, rather he is speaking about one of two things, either that which is in agreement with the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> having a specific evidence for it (like the congregational tarawih prayer) or that which is a maslahah mursalah, such as compiling the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the various sciences which developed afterwards which became means (wasaa'il) through which the religion is preserved, and matters of <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> like schools, hospices and so on.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Important Clarification</font>    <P>
<blockquote>An important note is due here which is that someone might say and ask: How come <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a> and indeed others, may have spoken or acted upon other affairs which are innovations according to you, and yet here you are using their words to clarify what was meant by them when they speak of "<a href="tags/good-innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>" or "praiseworthy innovation"? And the answer  is that the basis of innovations can be weak or fabricated hadeeths which some Scholars may have taken to be authentic as a result of which they are mistaken in that regard, and had they known or come to the conviction that it is a baseless hadith they would not have acted upon that action. Then there could be other reasons too, and it is possible that a Scholar show rejection against innovations, yet still be upon innovations himself in other areas. So the fact there may be found that which is considered <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> in our view with some of these scholars  - which has its own particular explanation - does not change the correctness of everything which has preceded, and we are simply pointing out the truth that is evident from a Scholar's speech and writing - even if he may have errors elsewhere, and the truth is the lost property of a believer. Further, these scholars in themselves are not the reference point, rather it is the Book and the Sunnah and all their views and opinions are judged by the Book and the Sunnah, so what agrees with them, is accepted and what disagrees with them is rejected. And what we have presented here from <a href='tags/al-izz-bin-abd-al-salam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam</font></a>, conforms to what is in the Book and the Sunnah and what the Companions and the Salaf were upon with respect to the understanding and application of the word bidah (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1593;&#1577;</span>) <u>in its <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> sense</u>.</blockquote>    <P>
