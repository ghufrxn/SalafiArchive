From that which distinguishes Ahl al-Sunnah, those upon the way of the Righteous Salaf, is that they have firm and unwavering conviction in the absolute completion and perfection of the Shari'ah, in all respects, in belief, worship and methodology. This itself is founded up clear and manifest revealed texts. This cannot be said about the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> and those who introduce and persist upon what has no basis either in its foundation, or in its details and particulars, from the Book and the Sunnah. For their tongue of disposition necessitates that the Shari'ah is deficient and is in need of completion.    <P>
Allaah, the Exalted said:     <P>
<div class='arabicquran' lang='AR-SA' align='right'><blockquote style='text-align:right;'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1608;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1602;&#1618;&#1578;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1587;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575; &#1604;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1576;&#1615;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1616; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote></div>  <blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> And I created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone). (51:56) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
To this end, Allaah revealed Books and sent Messengers and Prophets to mankind who came with legislations that inform and instruct them as to how to worship their Lord. The deen of all Messengers of Prophets is Islaam and whilst they are all upon a single united <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> as it relates to faith and monotheism, their legislations varied, because they were suited and appropriate for a given people, time and place. Then Allaah sent the last and final Messenger,  Muhammad, whose message is universal. As such, the legislation that he was given was perfected, completed and universal.    <P>
<div class='arabicquran' lang='AR-SA' align='right'><blockquote style='text-align:right;'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1610;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1603;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1604;&#1618;&#1578;&#1615; &#1604;&#1614;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1583;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1608;&#1614;&#1571;&#1614;&#1578;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618;&#1578;&#1615; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1606;&#1616;&#1593;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1578;&#1616;&#1610; &#1608;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1590;&#1616;&#1610;&#1578;&#1615; &#1604;&#1614;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1604;&#1575;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614; &#1583;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1611;&#1575; <img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote></div>  <blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> This day have I perfected your religion, completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. (5:3) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Ibn Katheer commented upon this verse:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is from the greatest of the favours of Allaah, the Exalted, upon this ummah in that He perfected their deen for them so that they are not in need of any deen besides it, and nor of any prophet besides their Prophet - may the prayers and peace of Allaah be upon Him. And for this reason Allaah, the Exalted, made him the seal of the prophets and sent him to the men and jinn. Thus, there is no <a href='tags/halaal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>halaal</font></a> except what he made <a href='tags/halaal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>halaal</font></a> and there is no <a href='tags/haraam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>haraam</font></a> except what he made <a href='tags/haraam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>haraam</font></a>, and there is no deen except what he legislated. And everything he informed about, it is true and the truth, there is no lie in whatsoever or any discrepancy, just as Allaah, the Exalted says, "<b>And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth (sidq) and in justice (adl)</b>" (6:115), meaning truthful in the information and just in the commands and prohibitions. So when He perfected the religion for them, the favour upon them became complete.</blockquote>    <P>
The completion of this favour is something that the <a href='tags/jews.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jews</font></a> themselves recognized. Tariq bin Shihab narrates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The <a href='tags/jews.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jews</font></a> said to Umar (bin al-Khattaab), "Indeed, you recite a verse in your Book which if it had been revealed to us, the gathering of the <a href='tags/jews.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jews</font></a>, we would have taken that day as a day of celebration!" He (Umar) said, "And which verse is that?" and they said, "<b>This day have I perfected your religion, completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.</b>" (5:3). Umar said, "By Allaah, indeed I know the day upon which it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and the hour in which it was revealed. It was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) on the evening of the day of <a href='tags/arafah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Arafah</font></a> on the day of Jumu'ah. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim.</font></blockquote>    <P>
This is an evidence to show that the Messenger (alayhis salaam) had indeed fulfilled his trust and conveyed the entire message with no deficiency or shortcoming therein. Ibn Amr narrates that the Messenger of Allaah (alayhis salaam) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There was not any Prophet before me except that it was a duty upon him to direct his nation to every good he knew for them and to warn them from every evil he knew for them. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Reported by Muslim in his Sahih</font></blockquote>    <P>
The Messenger (alayhis salaam) also said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I have not left anything which brings you closer to Paradise or distances you from the Fire except that I have informed you of it. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Related by Ibn Kathir in his tafsir of Surah Kahf (18:17).</font></blockquote>    <P>
The Messenger (alayhis salaam) also said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>By Him in whose hand is my soul, I have not left anything which brings you closer to Paradise and distances you from the Fire except that I have commanded you with it and have I left anything which  brings you closer to the Fire and distances you from Paradise except that I have prohibited you from it. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Related by Ahmad and Ibn Khuzaymah.</font></blockquote>    <P>
And the companion Abu Dharr al-Ghifaree stated, with what explains what has preceded:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) left us whilst there was not a bird flapping its wings in the sky except that he mentioned <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> regarding it to us. <font style='font-size:11px;'>Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Mu'jam al-Kabir (no. 1647).</font></blockquote>    <P>
The Messenger (alayhis salaam) spoke severely and constantly of the newly invented matters and innovations in the religion, even though there was not any <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> present.     <P>
Jaabir bin Abdullah narrates:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When the Messenger (alayhis salaam) would deliver a sermon, his eyes would be come red, his voice would be raised, and his anger would be severe, as if he was admonishing an army... and he would say, "To proceed, indeed the best speech  is the speech of Allaah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad and the worst of affairs (in the religion) are the newly-invented matters, and every <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> is misguidance." <font style='font-size:11px;'>Reported by Muslim.</font></blockquote>    <P>
All of this was perfectly understood and known by the Companions which is why there occurs from them, warnings from the newly-invented matters and the advice to suffice with what is in the Sunnah, and such statements of the Companions will be presented in other articles.    <P>
