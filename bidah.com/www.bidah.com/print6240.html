<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Our Maliki scholars have said: To undertake preparation for condolences (i.e. organize sittings) is an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and disliked. So [a person afflicted with the calamity of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of a family member] sits in his house, or in the mosque, in his sadness,  but without presenting himself to receive condolences. In this case there is no harm. When the news of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of Ja'far came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), he sat in the mosque, overcome with sadness and the people gave condolences to him. Malik said,     <P>
<blockquote>There is no harm if <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> is sent to the family of the deceased, regardless of whether it is a near-relative or not. And this is because the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, when the news of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of Ja'far [bin Abi Talib] came, '<i>Prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the family of Ja'far, for there has come to them what has preoccupied them</i>.'</blockquote>    <P>
And this <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> is recommended in the view of the bulk of the Scholars, because it is from (the deeds of) righteousness and nearness for the family and neighbours, and so it is recommended (mustahabb). But as for when the family (of the deceased) prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> and invite the people to it, nothing has been narrated about it at all from the predecessors (qudumaa), and in my view it is an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and disliked. And this view is from that which <a href='tags/al-shafii.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shafi'i</font></a> has agreed upon. <font style='font-size:11px;'><b>Al-Hawadith wal-Bida' (Dar Ibn al-Jawzee, pp. 170-171)</b></font> </blockquote>    <P>
Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz (rahimahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As for the family of the deceased person preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> and gathering the neighbours (to eat from it), then this is not correct, rather it is from the innovations, and from the evil sins. Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli (radiallahu anhu) said, "<i>We used to consider gathering with the family of the deceased and preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> after the burial from niyahah (prohibited form of lamentation from the days of ignorance)</i>."    <P>
Jarir (radiallaahu anhu) informed that they used to consider the people gathering with the family of the deceased and [the family] preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the people that this was considered to be from <a href='tags/niyaahah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>niyaahah</font></a>, meaning this is how the Companions (radiallaahu anhum) used to consider it. This shows that the family of the deceased is not to prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the people, and nor should they gather them together. However, it is recommended for their neighbours and relatives to send <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for them (the family) because of them becoming preoccupied with the calamity. <font style='font-size:11px;'><b>Fatawa Nur ala al-Darb (1/369) through al-Bida' wal-Muhdathaat (p. 336).</b></font></blockquote>    <P>
Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a> (rahimahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... this is due to the hadeeth of Jarir bin Abdullaah al-Bajli (radiallahu anhu) who said, "<i>We used to consider gathering with the family of the deceased and preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> after his burial from niyahah (prohibited form of lamentation from the days of ignorance)</i>." The Sunnah is that the relatives and neighbourss of the deceased prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the family of the deceased that will suffice them, due to the hadith of Abdullah bin Ja'far (radiallahu anhu), who said, "When the news of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of Ja'far came, when he was killed, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "Prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the family of Ja'far because an affair which has preoccupied them has come to them..." and the hadeeth is hasan. <font style='font-size:12px;'><b>Ahkaam al-Janaa'iz (p. 167).</b></font></blockquote>    <P>
Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Giving condolences when someone dies is legislated because it is from the angle of consolation (reassuring and strengthening), and it also comprises supplication for the deceased person. This is when the one giving condolences says to the one afflicted by the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of a near-relative, "May Allaah make good your consolation, relieve your calamity and forgive your deceased." And it is not desirable for there to be exaggeration in giving condolences (such as) setting up tents, and having huge gatherings, and going to liberties in preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> and banquets. Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli (radiallahu anhu) said, "<i>We used to consider gathering with the family of the deceased and preparing <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> after the burial from niyahah (prohibited form of lamentation from the days of ignorance)</i>."  The Sunnah is for one of the relatives or neighbours of those afflicted (with the death) to prepare the <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> according to need and present it to them, as a means of consolation for them. This is due to the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Ja'far (radiallahu anhu), when the news of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of Ja'far came, when he was killed, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Prepare <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> for the family of Ja'far because an affair which has preoccupied them has come to them</i>...", or "... <i>that which has preoccupied them has come to them</i>." And it is not desirable to sit in a specific place for condolences and announcing this. But the one afflicted with the calamity can be given condolences when he meets him in any place, and it should be at a time soon after the occurrence of the <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> and Allaah knows best. <font style='font-size:12px;'><b>Al-Muntaqaa (1/196-197).</b></font></blockquote>    <P>
It is not from the Sunnah, from what has preceded, for the family of the deceased to go out of their way and to undertake preparations to receive condolences by organizing and arranging special sittings. As for receiving those who come to offer condolences as part of the natural course of events (since it is inevitable that the family of the deceased will have visits from relative and neighbours), Shaykh Ibn Baz said <a href=http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/2760>in response to the question</a>:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Question:</b> What is the view of your eminence regarding the one who sits in the house to receive those who come to offer condolences, alongside the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> that many of those who offer condolences are not able to do so except by coming to the house (of the deceased)?    <P>
<b>Answer:</b> I do not know of any harm regarding the one upon whom a calamity has descended such as <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> of a near-relative or a wife and what is like that, for him to receive those who offer condolences in his house at a suitable time, because ta'ziyah (offering condolences) is sunnah and receiving those who offer the condolences is from what aids them in fulfilling this sunnah.

As for the issue of whether the family of the deceased can share the <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> that has been prepared for them by others and invite others to partake in it, there is <a href=http://www.ibnbaz.org.sa/mat/2776>a verdict of Shaykh Ibn Baz</a> in this regard:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>Question:</b> When lunch or supper is sent to the family of the deceased and people gather to eat from it in the house of the deceased, is this [considered to be] from the prohibited <a href='tags/niyaahah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>niyaahah</font></a> (lamentation)?    <P>
<b>Answer:</b> That is not from <a href='tags/niyaahah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>niyaahah</font></a> (prohibited lamentation), because they did not prepare the <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a>, but it was prepared for them.

This fatwa should be understood in light of what has preceded that it is not for the family of the deceased to make tasaddee (to undertake, preoccupy oneself) for receiving condolences, as in, go out of the way to receive the people for receiving condolences by organizing special sittings, and nor should the family request or pay for <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> to be made by others with the intent that they will feed those who will come and  gather at their house, because this now returns to the family themselves taking <a href='tags/responsibility.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>responsibility</font></a> for making the <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> (even if they themselves did not physically make it) and incurring a burden, and this returns to the prohibited <a href='tags/niyaahah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>niyaahah</font></a> (lamentation) mentioned by Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli (radiallaahu anhu).    <P>
