Imaam <a href='tags/al-shatibi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shatibi</font></a> said in his excellent book <i>al-I'tisam</i> (tahqiq M. Salman, Maktabah Dar al-Tawhid, 2/127-128), clarifying the different types of innovation:    <P>
<div align=center><img src=assets/images/bidah-shatibi-2-127.gif width="100%" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding the Rulings Pertaining to Proper <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and Relative <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and the Difference Between Them Both</font>    <P>
Before we look into that it is necessary to look at the explanation <b>al-bidah al-haqiqiyyah</b> (proper innovation) and <b>al-idafiyyah</b> (relative innovation).    <P>
<u>So we say and with Allaah lies success:</u> The <u><a href='tags/bidah-haqiqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah haqiqiyyah</font></a></u> (proper <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, in every sense of the word) is that which is not indicated by any <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> evidence, neither from the Book, nor the Sunnah, nor ijma' (consensus), nor qiyas (analogy) and nor any accepted evidence with the people of <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a>, neither in the generality nor in the detail. For this reason it is labelled "bidah" - as has been mentioned previously - because it is something invented without any prior example.    <P>
This is the case even if the innovator refuses that he should be ascribed with exiting from the (confines of) the <a href='tags/shariah-bj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, since he is claiming that he is (still) within it on account of what he has deduced upon the requirements of the evidences. However, that claim is not sound, neither in the affair in and of itself, and nor from what is apparent. As the affair in and of itself, then this is known by looking at it through (the evidences) and as for what is apparent, then his evidences are but doubts, they are not evidences, even if it is established that he has brought evidence, otherwise, the affair is clear.    <P>
And as for the <u><a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a></u> (relative innovation) then it has two elements to it:    <P>
<blockquote><b>The first:</b> It has a connection from the evidences, hence from that angle it is not an <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>.  <b>  The second:</b> It does not have any connection with the evidences except what there is for the <a href='tags/bidah-haqiqiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah haqiqiyyah</font></a> (in other words, no connection at all).</blockquote>    <P>
So when this action which has two elements to it is never devoid of one of the two affairs, we have given it this label of 'al-bidah al-idafiyyah.' Meaning that in relation to one of the two angles, it is sunnah, because it is supported by evidence, and in relation to the other angle, it is bidah, because it is [either] supported by a doubt (shubhah), not upon evidence, or it is not supported by anything.    <P>
And the difference between them in terms of meaning is:  That the evidence for it (<a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a>) from the angle of the foundation (asl) is established. And from the angle of the details (kaifiyyaat) or states (ahwaal) or particulars (tafseelaat), or times (awqaat), no evidence is established for it despite the fact that it is in need of (evidence) because most of (this type) occurs in the matters of worship, not in the pure customary matters, as will be mentioned shortly inshaa'Allaah.</blockquote>    <P>
It is important to note that the contemporary Sufi grave-worshippers and other than them from the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a> try to deceive and confuse between what is <a href='tags/bidah-idafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bidah idafiyyah</font></a> (relative innovation) - which is what they are upon, and what they call the people to - and between other matters which a minority of  scholars include within the label of "<a href="tags/good-innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/good-innovation-qr.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">good <a href="tags/innovation.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">innovation</font></a></font></a></font></a>" but who are merely using this label from the purely linguistic point of view in relation to matters of beneficial <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a> (maslahah mursalah). Refer to these articles for more on this:    <P>
