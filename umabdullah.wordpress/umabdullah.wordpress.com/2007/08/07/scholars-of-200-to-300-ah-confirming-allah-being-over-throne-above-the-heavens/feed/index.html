					<description><![CDATA[jazakallahu khayran akhi Abu Bilal
I was planning on posting some quotes by Imam Ibn Jarir at Tabari rahimahu Allah on this, including the quote you posted.
May Allah reward you brother.

----------------

As for the belief that Allah is everywhere, the ones who reject Allah being above the heavens, some of them do not believe that Allah is everywhere, many of the them believe that Allah is neither inside His creation nor outside of His creation, and if you ask them &quot;then where is Allah?&quot;
They say &quot;It is forbidden to ask &#039;where is Allah?&#039;&quot;

Subhanallah, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam asked a slave girl &quot;where is Allah?&quot;

Did he do something &quot;forbidden&quot; here?
doesn&#039;t matter what they interpret the hadith to mean, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam still asked &quot;where is Allah?&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bismillah
You can also add:
The First Person to say Allah is every where:
ِAs we said, the pious imams never said that Allah is present everywhere. Perhaps, the first person to say that is Jahm Bin Safwan, whom most scholars consider as Kaafir, and Imam Ahmed wrote a book specifically to refute him, as did Bukhari in Kitaab Al-Tawhid wa radd &#039;alal jahmiyyah in Sahih Al-Bukhari.
10) Imam Al-Dhahabi says: &quot;He was the foundation of misguidance, the leader of the sect Jahmiyyah....He used to say that Allah is present in all places&quot; (Siyar A&#039;laam Al-Nubalaa vol 6 page 26-27).
Conclusions:
We see that the Sahabah, the Taba&#039;een and Imams all had the same Aqeedah: that Allah is Above the Throne above the sky, in the manner that befits Allah. The idea that He is everywhere Himself (the Salaf believed His Knowledge is present everywhere) is an innovation, a bid&#039;ah, started by Jahm bin Safwan or his bid&#039;ati teacher Ja&#039;d bin Dirham, who were refuted by every one from Imam Abu Hanifa to Imam Bukhari to the present day. We provided the sayings of early scholars and you the later scholars. Please reply.

وقال الذهبي في كتابه: سير أعلام النبلاء ج 6 ص 26 - 27 في ترجمة جهم بن صفوان قال: &quot; أبو محرز الراسي مولاهم السمرقندي الكاتب المتكلم، أس الضلالة ورأس الجهمية كان صاحب ذكاء وجدال، كتب للأمير شريح التميمي وكان ينكر الصفات، وينزه البارئ عنها بزعمه، ويقول بخلق القرآن، ويقول: إن الله في الأمكنة كلها، قال ابن حزم كان يخالف مقاتلًا في التنجيم، وكان يقول: الإيمان عقد بالقلب، وإن لفظ الكفر. قيل: إن سلم بن أحوز قتل الجهم لإنكاره أن الله كلم موسى &quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Pillars of Islam and Iman and what every muslim must know about his religion written by Shaykh muhammad bin Jamil zeno (Darussalam publication) pg28-30
Mu&#039;awiyah bin Al-Hakam As-Salmi radhiallahu anhu said:

I had a slave-girl who used to herd sheep for me. One day I discovered that a wolf had killed one of her sheep, and I&#039;m a man from the children of Adam, I get upset like they get upset, and I slapped her in the face. Then I went to the Prophet Salalahu alayhi wa salam who impressed upon me the seriousness of my act. I said, &quot;O messenger of Allah, salalahu alayhi wa salam, should I not set her free?&quot; He (Salalahu alayhi wa salam) said, &quot;Bring her to me.&quot; He asked her, &quot;Where is Allah?&quot; She said, &quot;He is above the heavens.&quot; He said, &quot;Who am I?&quot; She said, &quot;You are the Messenger of Allah salalahu alayhi wa salam&quot; He said, &quot;Free her, for she is a believer.&quot; (Muslim and Abu Dawud)

Among the benefits to be derived from this hadith are:

1. The companions of the Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam used to refer to him with their problems, even a small one, to know what is in the law of Allah regarding it.

2. All issues for judgement should be referred to Allah and His Messenger salalahua alyhi wa salam, acting upon the statement of Allah ta ala:

&quot;But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you (salalahu alayhi wa salam) a judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission&quot; (4:65)

3. The Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam reproached the companion for slapping the slave-girl and considred it a serious matter.

4. Belief is a condition for freeing a slave; since the Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam tested her, and after learning she was a believer, he ordered her to be set free; and if she had been a disbeliever, he wouldn&#039;t have ordered for her freedom.

5. The necessity of asking about Tawhid (Islamic monotheism); and part of it is the belief that Allaah is above His Throne, and knowledge of that is mandatory.

6. The legitimacy of asking &quot;Where is Allah?&quot; ; in fact it is sunnah, since the Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam asked it.

7. The legitimacy of replying that Allah is above the heavens, since the Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam affirmed the reply of the slave girl and it also goes along with the statement of Allah in the Qur&#039;an:

&quot;Do you feel secure that He, who is over the heaven (allah) will not cause the earth to sink with you?&quot; (67:16)

Ibn abbas radhiallahuma said that the one reffered to in the verse by the word &#039;Who&#039; is Allah.

[Note: The literal translation of Fis sama is in heavens, the scholars explained it according to the arabic language to have the meaning of above as it is not possible for Allah to be surrounded by His creation, and sometimes the word fi is used in the meaning of ala (on) as stated in the verse:

&quot;I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees&quot; (20:17)

The other interpretation is based on the variant meaning of the word Sama in arabic refers to that which is elevated. It is used to refer to the ceiling of a house, to the sky, to the heavens and to elevation and transcendence. So the phrase could be translated: &#039; in Transcendence&#039;]

8. The correctness of belief includes the testimony that Muhammad salalahu alayhi wa salam is the messenger of Allah.

9. The belief that Allah is above the heaven is an indicator of the soundness of one&#039;s belief , and it is mandatory on every believer.

10. The refutation of the erroneous belief that Allah is in every place by His self. The truth is that Allah is with us by His Knowledge not by His self.

11. The fact that the Prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam ordered to bring the slave girl in order to test her shows that he did not possess the knowledge of the unseen (except what Allah informed him] which in this case is the belief of the slave girl. This refutes the claim of many sufi that he had a complete knowledge of the unseen.]]></description>
