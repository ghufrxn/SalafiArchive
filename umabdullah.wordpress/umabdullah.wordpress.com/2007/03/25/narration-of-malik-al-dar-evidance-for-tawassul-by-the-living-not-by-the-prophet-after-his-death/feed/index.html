					<description><![CDATA[Salaam:

Impressive research Masha Allah. You posted your argument on Seeking Ilm&#039;s Tawassul Challenge. In it you included amongst your citations:
C. Shihab adDeen Abdur Rahman bin Askar al Baghdadi al Maliki (d. 732) in his book “Irshad as-Salik ila Ashraf al Masalik fi fiqh al Imam Malik“: 
He sited it in chapter of (istisqa’ – asking for rain), in which he said (before siting the narration of Malik al Dar):
“and it is recommanded/liked to do istishfa’ (intercession) through righteous/pious people, and ahl al bayt“
Then he quotes the narration that is in sahih, the tawassul of Umar through al Abbas (radiyallahu anhuma), and right after it he says “and Ibn Abi Shayba narrated”, and quotes Malik ad Dar’s narration.
so this clearly shows that he used the narration of Malik as evidence for “doing istishfa’ through ahl al bayt”, for al Abbas ra was the uncle f the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, and the dream the man saw, was guiding him to ask Umar to do istisqa’ for the people, in which he did it through al Abbas radiyallahu anhu
May I ask why you didn&#039;t include it in the post in your own page?

WaaSalaam

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;As-Salamu alaikum&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;


wa alaykum assalam



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a question about the Narration:
I Understand from the Narration that if a Person goes to the grave of a death Person, and asks him that the death Person ask for them Allah for some thing like: “Rain” or other Things, than this is not Shirk al-Akbar? &lt;strong&gt;I mean if it was Shirk al-Akbar than Umar (radyallahu anhu) had said this to him. But Umar (radyallahu anhu) dont critis him for his asking at the Grave&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;There is no evidence that Umar radiyallahu anhu knew about the man going to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.  I will explain it to you in the following points insha Allah:

1. In the narration it says (&lt;em&gt;The man went and told `Umar&lt;/em&gt;), it does not mention what the man told Umar, if  he told him that he went to the grave and about the dream, or if he ONLY told him about the dream.  We know for sure that he told him about the dream but we don&#039;t have any evidence that he told him about him going to the grave.
It is just an assumption, and we can&#039;t use assumptions as evidence.

2.  If the man told Umar radiyallahu anhu that he went to the grave of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and made tawassul through him, then why would Umar radiyallahu anhu make tawassul through al Abbas after knowing that?
Isn&#039;t the tawassul through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sufficient? and he is the best creation of Allah !
&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;But if the Person ask the death Person for Things which they dont can do, which can only do Allah, like for Rain, as a example if a person asks: “Oh Fulan, let it rain!” Than this is Shirk al-Akbar&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;This is called istighatha, and to do istighatha by someone who has died is shirk Akbar.&lt;/strong&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[As-Salamu alaikum,

very good explanation, i was confused because i had read some arguments of the Ahl al-Sufiyya. And now i have understand the true - al-Hamdulillah-

I have a question about the Narration:
I Understand from the Narration that if a Person goes to the grave of a death Person, and asks him that the death Person ask for them Allah for some thing like: &quot;Rain&quot; or other Things, than this is not Shirk al-Akbar? I mean if it was Shirk al-Akbar than Umar (radyallahu anhu) had said this to him. But Umar (radyallahu anhu) dont critis him for his asking at the Grave. 

But if the Person ask the death Person for Things which they dont can do, which can only do Allah, like for Rain, as a example if a person asks: &quot;Oh Fulan, let it rain!&quot; Than this is Shirk al-Akbar. 

And if he asks the death Person at his grave that they ask something Allah for them than this is not Jaiz, and not Shirk al-Akbar?

Have i understand it right? Because i have think that it is Shirk al-Akbar to ask the death that they ask Allah.

I hope you can explain me this. (I hope you understand what i have write, my english isnt good.) wa salamu alaikum]]></description>
