					<description><![CDATA[Assalamoaleikum Warahmatullah,

Jazakallahu khairan for the wonderful post. Just wanted to add here that this particular narration is weak with all its various routes as indicated by Muhaddith Sheikh Zubair Ali Zai (hafidhahullah). Hafiz Ibn Hajr(rahimahullah) had considered the hadith to be Hassan considering the various routes of narration even if they were weak. However the likes of this cannot be used as an evidence for Hassan Li&#039;ghayrihi. So the discussion above comes only after if one considers the above hadith to be sahih which it is not. Allah Knows Best!!]]></description>
