					<description><![CDATA[[from Abu&#039;l-Khattab_al-Khalwadani, Sunni press forums]


al-Salamu &#039;Alaikum,

As far as I remember, Abu &#039;Isa al-Tirmidhi is a student of Ishaq b. Rahawayh and was one of his oldest teachers. So there is no problem if he relates from him.

And if he&#039;s not his direct student, surely he narrated it from someone or it is something well-known cause he was his contemporary. I believe al-Tirmidhi was born 15 years after al-Bukhari (born 194): that is in 209. al-Tirmidhi died in 279, that is: he became ca. 70 years old. Ibn Rahawayh is known to have died for sure in 238, meaning: al-Tirmidhi was almost 30 when Ibn Rahawayh died.

These things assures us to trust al-Tirmidhi&#039;s narrations from Ishaq or any other major Muhaddith in his &#039;Ilal. Actually, all statements of al-Tirmidhi in his Jami or &#039;Ilal-book concerning narrators and narrations from other Imams who he might never have met are to be trusted, since scholars rely upon them too.

					<description><![CDATA[as-salaamu alaykum

jazakallaah khayr

wa barakallaah feeki 

 This is clear cut refutation to the ashariyyah and maturidiyah who accuse us of tashbih for making ITHBAT (affirmation) of the attributes and making Nafi (negation) of anything similar to him.
