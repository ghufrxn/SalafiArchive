					<description><![CDATA[This post of mine is not really directed to shia, it is directed to ahl assunnah who take from those scholars.
The part that is a reply to shia, using logic and other evidences, is in the link I posted at the end of my post.

As for your saying:

[All those so called scholars that you have mentioned that have falsified the above hadeeth were naseebis (ie they had hatred for Imam Ali(as) in their heart). ]

are you claiming that you know what is in the hearts of men?

If not, then how do you know that they have hatred for Imam Ali radiyallahu anhu in their hearts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This has got to be one of the most pathetic &quot;replies&quot; to the shia.

All those so called scholars that you have mentioned that have falsified the above hadeeth were naseebis (ie they had hatred for Imam Ali(as) in their heart). How then can you prove your opposition wrong through your own sources. Its like a christian telling you jesus was crucified because the bible and the christian scholars said so.]]></description>
