The pleasure of alcohol will fade away as his health and intellect degrade.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, an adulterer may rationalize his promiscuity\u00a0by imagining that it makes him happy and fulfills his purpose in life, but eventually he will see its harm in the form of disease, emotional turmoil, scandalous exposure, or worse. The pleasure of adultery will fade as his youth and stamina degrade.<\/p>\n<p>The satisfaction of desire will soon pale in comparison to the great void in our\u00a0soul that comes from neglecting our spiritual purpose.
