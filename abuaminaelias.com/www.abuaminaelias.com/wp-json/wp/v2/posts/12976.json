The purpose of this rule is to avoid the serious sins of adultery and premarital sex.<\/p>\n<p>However, a particular narration is cited out of context to imply that breastfeeding adults is allowed in Islam. There was a specific case in which the Prophet (s) allowed a household servant to drink the breast milk of a wife, which had been poured into a cup, to put the husband at ease. By doing so, the servant would become like a family member according to Arab culture, but this incident was limited to a single case on account of its unique social conditions; it was not made into a general rule in Islam.<\/p>\n<p>Aisha reported: Salim was the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfa and lived with him and his family in their house. The wife of Abu Hudhayfa came to the Prophet and she said, &#8220;Salim has reached puberty as men do, he knows what they know. He enters our house freely, and I sense that this disturbs the heart of Abu Hudhayfa.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u062a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0630\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0628\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0633\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a \u062d\u064f\u0630\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0629\u064e<\/p>\n<p><b>Let him be fed with breast milk and he will be unlawful for you to marry, then the disturbance in Abu Hudhayfa&#8217;s heart will disappear.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Source: S\u0323ah\u0323i\u0304h\u0323 Muslim 1453, Grade: <b><i>Sahih<\/i><\/b><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Abu Hudhayfa&#8217;s wife returned and she said, \u201cI fed him with breast milk (in a cup) and the disturbance in Abu Hudhayfa\u2019s heart disappeared.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this situation, Salim grew up in the household of Abu Hudhayfa as a member of the family, although he was not directly related to them.
