In addition, the practice predates Islam and is supported by non-Muslim cultures as well.<\/p>\n<p>According to Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Linking female circumcision to Islamic philosophy and instruction has proven quite dubious. If Islam is indeed the foundation of female circumcision, how can we explain the persistence of the tradition among non-Muslim peoples who embrace it with equal ardor and enthusiasm? Conversely, how can we account for the fact that the great majority of adherents in some Muslim societies do not carry out any form of female genital excision?<\/p>\n<p>Source: Abusharaf, R. M. (2006). <em>Female circumcision: Multicultural perspectives<\/em>. p. 2<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From all of this, we can reasonably determine that the practice of female circumcision originated in cultures before Islam and was later \u201cIslamized\u201d by Muslim jurists.<\/p>\n<p>Sheikh Dr. Abdur Rahman ibn Hasan al-Nafisah writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no evidence that this practice was widespread among the pious predecessors (<em>salaf as-salih<\/em>). Moreover, the practice has never been prevalent in the regions where Islam originated, Mecca and Medina and the surrounding areas of Arabia. It is extremely rare. If female circumcision had truly been endorsed by Islamic Law, it would certainly have been practiced and perpetuated in those regions. Only male circumcision is practiced, due to the authentic evidence in the Sunnah that it is part of the natural way (<em>fitrah<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>We conclude that female circumcision is merely a cultural practice that has no prescribed Islamic ruling for it and that is supported by no decisive textual evidence. It is simply a regional custom in the places where it is practiced. We must then take into consideration that many medical professionals consider it to have detrimental effects for the girls who undergo the operation. On that basis, it would be impermissible to allow this custom to continue. In Islamic Law, preservation of the person, the life and bodily soundness of the person, is a legal necessity. Anything that compromises this legal necessity by bringing harm to the person is unlawful.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Islam Today<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the practice of female circumcision does not have support from the Quran and the tradition of the Prophet. It is a cultural tradition that has been adopted by some Muslim cultures and most Muslims do not practice it. If performing female circumcision leads to bodily harm, then such acts are forbidden by Islam.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
