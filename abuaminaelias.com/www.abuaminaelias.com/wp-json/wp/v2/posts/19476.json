Believers should not waste their valuable moments engaging in fruitless online debates with such misguided people. Rather, one should hope some of them will eventually be guided, or at least recant their vilification of Islam, as even the worst enemies of Islam can become the greatest of Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is a collective obligation for Muslims to answer serious allegations against Islam and to provide accurate information for those in need of it. These anti-Muslim claims are meant to undermine people&#8217;s faith or to demonize the Muslim community in support of a political agenda. Every single accusation or misinterpretation of Islam can be rebutted as long as we are patient enough to search for it.<\/p>\n<p>There are literally thousands of prophetic traditions describing events in an ancient era, which most people do not have sufficient knowledge to properly understand. Some traditions are very clear in the moral lesson they convey to us, even today in translation, while others require substantial study of classical Arabic, anthropology, and history to interpret correctly.<\/p>\n<p>In one such tradition, Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, is described as taking a concubine-wife into his household from among the prisoners of war.
