After all, marriage should be based upon love and mercy, as stated in the Quran, and part of a healthy sexual relationship is the mutual pleasure experienced by both parties. Any form of sexual violence has been and always will be unlawful in Islam.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of \u2018consent,\u2019 however, has been transformed by modern developed secular liberal societies into not only a moral consideration, but the primary legal requirement that makes sex lawful. They no longer require a valid marriage contract for sex to be deemed legal and, in many places, adultery is no longer a crime.<\/p>\n<p>This transformation has not only contributed to the proliferation of sexual promiscuity and an epidemic of sexually-transmitted diseases, but also to legal confusion as \u2018consent\u2019 is often subjective and is difficult to define and establish as a matter of law. Consent may or may not be stated outright in any sexual encounter; it may be implicitly understood by one party and not another, it may be withdrawn after the fact upon reflection, or it may be lied about. Matters become all the more confusing when the consumption of alcohol and drugs is involved, placing liberal policy-makers in the difficult position of reconciling the legal protection afforded to extramarital sex and alcohol use with the vagueness of consent.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Muslims considered sex to be lawful in only two cases: marriage and concubinage. Concubinage is no longer valid due to the unanimous abolition of slavery, making marriage the only contemporary lawful outlet for sexual activity. These boundaries are clearly defined and more objective as a legal basis than &#8216;consent.&#8217; Therefore, the discussion of consent as a matter of law is less relevant to Muslims who adhere to Islamic teachings. By confining sex to marriage and avoiding alcohol or drugs, Muslims are secure from the legal and moral anarchy that the sexual revolution has unleashed. And because &#8216;consent&#8217; is a very modern issue in terms of the law, the early Muslims did not discuss it explicitly.<\/p>\n<p>Since mutual pleasure is one of the acknowledged purposes of lawful sex, it naturally cannot be attained by force, compulsion, or violence. Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i, may Allah have mercy on him, has an interesting passage that can possibly shed light upon the unstated views of the earliest jurists. They did not discuss the issue of consent as a legal matter, so we must \u2018read between the lines,\u2019 so to speak, to infer what they might have thought about it from a moral perspective. Al-Shafi&#8217;i was asked questions about a man\u2019s responsibility to spend time with his wife or wives, and specifically whether he is required to have intercourse with her at regular intervals. He answered:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0645\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u064a\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0624\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0650\u0631\u064e \u0628\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u0636\u0631\u0628\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0636\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064c \u0628\u0650\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0625\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0636\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0646\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0625\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0636\u0650\u0639\u064f \u062a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0630\u0651\u064f\u0630\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u062c\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, if he has only one wife or an additional concubine with whom he has intercourse, he is commanded to fear Allah Almighty and to not harm her in regards to intercourse, although nothing specific is obligated upon him. He is only obligated to provide what benefits her such as financial maintenance, residence, clothing, and spending the night with her. As for intercourse, its position is one of pleasure and no one can be forced into it (<em>la yujbaru ahadun \u2018alayhi<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Source: al-Umm 5\/203<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The main legal takeaway of this passage is that a husband cannot be forced by law to have intercourse with his wife on a consistent basis because a man does not necessarily have control over his ability to achieve an erection. A careful reading of this paragraph, however, reveals a little bit more about how sex was conceived. Al-Shafi&#8217;i commands the husband \u201cto fear Allah\u201d and \u201cto not harm her in regards to intercourse\u201d by abandoning her completely. Ibn Qudamah and others were more strict than him, saying a husband is obligated to satisfy his wife\u2019s sexual needs on a regular basis. Al-Shafi&#8217;i and these jurists acknowledged that not being intimate with her at all would be emotionally harmful.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Al-Shafi&#8217;i\u2019s broad wording at the end of the paragraph (\u201cno one may be forced into it\u201d) seems to be a general observation on the nature of marital sex as a mutually pleasurable activity, especially since he acknowledges that a husband abstaining from sex completely would be harmful to his wife. It was not uncommon for jurists to make a wider point when discussing a specific case or relate it back to their social or moral values. Al-Shafi&#8217;i\u2019s habit was to admonish men to treat women in the best way. When discussing the matter of divorcing a menstruating wife just a few pages earlier, for instance, he says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0643\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0641\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062d\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0636\u0650 \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627<\/p>\n<p>Allah Almighty has commanded good conduct, to release in the best manner, and He has prohibited harm.

In fact, one of Al-Shafi&#8217;s&#8217;s successors, Imam Abu Abdullah al-Halimi, understood precisely this point in regard to concubinage, writing:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0649 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0647\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0636\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0636\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0637\u0623\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0625\u0630\u0646\u0647\u0627<\/p>\n<p>If a female slave is purchased and she dislikes to be touched, or slept with, then he may not touch her, lie with her, or have intercourse with her unless she consents.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Minh\u0101j f\u012b Shu\u2019ab al-Im\u0101n 3\/267<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Appreciating this point is important to the way we understand and characterize the historical institution of concubinage, which did not consider &#8216;consent&#8217; as a matter of law. Some academics and anti-Muslim activists accuse Muslims of sanctioning \u2018rape\u2019 via concubinage, on the basis that modern notions of consent were absent, but to do so is to inaccurately transpose a very modern legal discussion, in a very modern libertine social context, onto a pre-modern society for whom these issues were not considered important.<\/p>\n<p>The classical jurists likely did not consider consent a legal issue for the same reasons that it is problematic in the modern period: it is notoriously difficult to properly define in law and establish as a fact in court. It is not surprising that jurists living hundreds of years ago did not develop legal answers to issues that did not arise until the last hundred years, under radically different cultural conditions, and are still unsettled to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, since classical Islamic legal sources say little about consent in sexual relations, it is likely that Muslim women in the pre-modern period did not consider their personal sexual autonomy as a priority, instead focusing on more relevant material issues such as equity in marriage, maintenance rights, protection from abuse and predation, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The sanctification of personal sexual autonomy is itself a very modern concept that arose with the advent of irreligious political ideologies based upon individual fulfillment, which means such an idea of consent simply did not exist in pre-modern societies at all. We cannot realistically assume pre-modern women were as concerned about \u2018consent\u2019 as much as modern women living in an entirely different secular liberal social climate.<\/p>\n<p>Yet Islam, even in its earliest stages, had legal mechanisms to protect women from sexual violence without the need for enshrining consent into law. The principle of \u2018no harm\u2019 provided women with protection from male abusers ever since the Prophet (s\u0323) decreed it, and it serves as a universal principle from which modern laws can be derived to confront uniquely modern abuses. Unlike consent, which modern societies still struggle to properly define, the prohibition of harm is an objective and comprehensive category that effectively outlaws rape and sexual assault and any future forms these violent crimes may take.<\/p>\n<p>Abu Sa\u2019id al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0636\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0636\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0651\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0631\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0642\u0651\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0642\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do not cause<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>harm or return harm.

It can be inferred from the Quran and Sunnah that consent was and is an important moral consideration in a healthy and lawful sexual relationship, as was understood by Al-Shafi&#8217;i and others. Consent, as a primary legal requirement, is a distinctly modern phenomenon born out of liberal societies\u2019 abandonment of marriage as the defining pre-condition for lawful sexual intercourse. Transposing this new cultural conception of consent onto pre-modern societies and legal texts has led some writers, including some wayward Muslims, to inaccurately claim that sexual violence is approved by Islam.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows best.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;&#8230;he may not touch her, lie with her, or have
