A Muslim man who takes another wife should do so to fulfill his social responsibilities, such as caring for a widowed woman, and not as a means to increase his pleasure.<\/p>\n<p>Allah said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">\u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062e\u0650\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u062a\u064f\u0642\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0637\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0650\u062d\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0650\u0651\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0648\u064e\u062b\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062b\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062e\u0650\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652<\/p>\n<p><b>If you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of other women, two or three or four.

He was married to his wife Khadijah for twenty-five years and he only remarried after she passed away. His plural marriages later in his life were due to his unique mission to be an example for the Muslim community, by taking care of widows, reconciling families through marriage, freeing slaves, and educating his wives in the teachings of Islam.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that the Bible allows polygyny and places no restrictions upon it. For example, one verse reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Solomon he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Source: 1 Kings 11:3<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Jews and Christians have no basis to criticize Islam for allowing polygyny, as their scriptures do not forbid it nor place any legal or moral restrictions upon it.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, most human societies practice some form of polygynous marriages. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/eclectic.ss.uci.edu\/~drwhite\/worldcul\/Codebook4EthnoAtlas.pdf\">Ethnographic Atlas Codebook<\/a>, of the 1,231 societies under study, 186 were monogamous, 453 had occasional polygyny, 588 had more frequent polygyny, and 4 had polyandry. Therefore, the view that polygyny is immoral is based upon a particular cultural norm that is not a universally recognized majority.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, Islam allows polygyny but with important legal and moral restrictions. It is best for a man to have one wife so as to avoid jealousy and unfairness between co-wives, but it is permissible for a man to have up to four wives if he is capable of treating them fairly and his marriages will serve the interests of the common good.<\/p>\n<p><i>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows best.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;You will never be
