The truth is that an infinite regression of contingent, temporal, and created causes is impossible.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali explains this reality from a number of angels in his refutation of the philosophers. One thought-experiment he provides is based upon the movements of the planets around the Sun. Imagine that the solar system has existed for eternity. Yet, the planet Saturn still revolves around the Sun once for every thirty years on Earth. This means the Earth has completed more revolutions than Saturn, while an eternal universe must necessitate that both planets have made an equally infinite number of revolutions. The number of revolutions of Earth compared to Saturn cannot be both equal and unequal at the same time, as Al-Ghazali says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0639\u0636\u0647 \u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0641\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0646<\/p>\n<p>Each number has no end, yet some of them are less than others.

Rather, such claims of an eternal universe are counter-intuitive to our entire human experience, which is unavoidably based upon the acceptance of discrete cause-and-effect as a fact of life.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, the question, &#8216;Who created the Creator?&#8217; is a logical fallacy based upon a mistake of category. The cosmological argument definitively concludes that the uncreated Creator must exist and, hence, asking who created the uncreated Creator is nonsensical. It is like asking what sound do colors make; these properties do not relate to each other in the way the question presumes. When the believers are confronted with this question, which originates from Satan, they should seek refuge in Allah and reaffirm their faith. If they need further reassurance, they should investigate the many evidences proving not only the existence of the Creator, but also His indisputable power over the creation and His absolute right to be worshipped alone without any partner.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows best.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;It is known by necessity and
