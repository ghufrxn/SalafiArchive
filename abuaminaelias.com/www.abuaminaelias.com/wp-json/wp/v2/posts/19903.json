Religion is based upon the evidence of revelation and science is based upon demonstrable natural evidence, both of which can be interpreted in different ways. Religion and science properly practiced both reveal aspects of the same unified Truth, so any conflict between them is only <em>apparent<\/em> and not actual. Rather, such conflicts are only due to the potential weakness in one\u2019s understanding of either religion or science.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
