Free speech is not merely a human right, but rather it is a <em>responsibility<\/em>. The purpose of free speech is to facilitate discussion in search of truth and justice. Consequently, the general rule is that people are free to speak their minds respectfully, but speech that serves no purpose other than to slander, defame, offend, or incite to violence is not worthy of protection. Indeed, the Muslims have been prohibited from cursing other religions and even idols.<\/p>\n<p>Allah said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0628\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0628\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0648\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0639\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do not insult those they invoke besides Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Surat al-An\u2019am 6:108<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For this reason, many Muslim countries have statutes against defaming Islam as well as Judaism, Christianity, and other religions, as this harms the cohesion of peaceful communities. Most countries in the world impose legal or at least social restraints on free speech with laws against slander and defamation, as well as\u00a0what they consider \u201cblasphemy,\u201d such as the many European countries that prohibit profaning the memory of the Holocaust. Muslims and all people should respect such limits as it is the responsibility of good citizens to refrain from harming social order and peace.<\/p>\n<p>However, the best way to counter false speech is by speaking the truth. The problem of blasphemy can usually\u00a0be remedied by a number of peaceful solutions such as publishing articles, setting up websites, holding conferences, and arguing with good manners. Every non-violent means should be used to counter blasphemous speech before resorting to legal action and especially the death penalty. No doubt, the least likely to resort to killing are the true believers.<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Mas\u2019ud reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0623\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0633\u0650 \u0642\u0650\u062a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0623\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650<\/p>\n<p><strong>The most restrained of the people regarding killing are the people of faith.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Source: Musnad Ah\u0323mad 3720, Grade: <a href=\"https:\/\/abuaminaelias.com\/dailyhadithonline\/2012\/11\/27\/ahl-al-iman-restrained-killing\/\"><strong><em>Sahih<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Muslims must avoid calling for the death penalty whenever possible, because indulgence in this matter indicates a lack of strong faith.<\/p>\n<p>We also need to view this matter from the legal principle of public welfare (<em>maslahah mursalah<\/em>).\u00a0Ibn Taymiyyah defines this principle as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u062d\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u062c\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0647\u0650\u062f\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0628\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0639\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647<\/p>\n<p>The principle of public welfare is the case when a distinguished jurist views another action as more likely to bring benefit and there is nothing in the law to negate it.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Majmu\u0304&#8217; al-Fata\u0304wa\u0301\u00a011\/342<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In so many cases, we see that the prosecution of blasphemy can cause greater harm to the community and the image of Islam than the blasphemy itself.

Prosecution for mere childish insults and thoughtless, impromptu remarks, without evidence of treasonous intent, only project an image of Islam as intolerant and draconian. Rather, judges need to carefully consider the unintended consequences and they must justify any prosecution in terms greater than mere insults and hurt feelings.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, we have the lessons of history which compel us to seek mitigation and restriction of the classical blasphemy law. Numerous Muslim scholars were imprisoned and persecuted because their views were considered \u201cblasphemy\u201d by the ruling regime. Most notably is the case of Ahmad ibn Hanbal who was imprisoned and tortured by the ruling Mu\u2019tazilte regime for his alleged blasphemy of affirming the Quran was uncreated. An uncompromising and loosely\u00a0interpreted blasphemy statute increases the possibility of it being misused\u00a0by a corrupt regime to victimize callers to truth.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, numerous verses and traditions in Islam demonstrate that the general rule for responding to blasphemy is to counter it with patience, forbearance, and speaking the truth in a beautiful manner. Muslims ought to behave this way in the overwhelming majority of cases. The only exception to this rule is derived from the specific cases in which the Prophet (s\u0323) punished some people for treason in addition to their harmful utterances. We must not expand this specific rule to all cases, thereby negating the general teachings of mercy, patience, and tolerance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
