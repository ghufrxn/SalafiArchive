So what is the lesson?<\/p>\n<p>There are a few possible interpretations of the meaning of this incident, but perhaps the best opinion is that the Prophet (s) had not intended to kill the man at all.

To resolve the dispute, Solomon ordered his companions to bring a knife and cut the child into two pieces. Upon hearing this, the real mother relented rather that seeing her child killed, thus the true mother was revealed. He had never planned to harm the child.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the Prophet (s) initially gave the order to kill the man but, being guided by divine revelation, he knew that the situation would resolve itself on its own. It was a teaching mechanism for Ali, who would later become the fourth of the righteous caliphs and who was famous for his wise judgment. Ali learned not to make assumptions of guilt from hearsay alone.<\/p>\n<p>As in the story of Al-Khidr and Moses in Surat al-Kahf, one should not rush to judgment based merely upon outward appearances, but rather one must gather all the facts (i.e. <em>context<\/em>) before an appropriate conclusion can be made.<\/p>\n<p>In a similar reading, the man had indeed misbehaved by improperly secluding himself with the concubine Maryah but he had not committed adultery, so the Prophet (s) only intended to frighten him for doing so while at the same time publicly proving his innocence.<\/p>\n<p>Ibn

interpret the tradition as if the Prophet (s) truly did not intend to kill him. Indeed, he only intended to frighten him as a rebuke for coming near to her. They said it was as Solomon had said to the two women disputing each other about the child: I will bring the knife until I cleave the child in half. He did not intend to do that, but rather his purpose was to make the matter of this statement known.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, the Imams understood the lesson of this tradition to be that the judge can pretend to believe differently from the truth as a means to arrive at recognition of the truth. The Prophet (s) liked for the innocence of the companion to be made known, as well as the innocence of Maryah. He knew that when the man saw the sword, he would reveal the reality of his condition and thus the matter concluded as the Prophet had estimated.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Za\u0304d al-Ma&#8217;a\u0304d 5\/15<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this view, it was from the prophetic wisdom that the Prophet (s) would know that Ali would have discovered the truth and arrived at the correct judgement for himself, thereby exonerating both the man and Maryah of the accusations against them.<\/p>\n<p>We should always assume the best of the Prophet (s) whenever we come across narrations that, on a superficial level, seem to contradict the Quran or the whole of Islamic teachings. The Prophet was divinely inspired and therefore his actions, while sometimes counter-intuitive at first, reveal profound wisdom when fully investigated in context.<\/p>\n<p>As for those who deliberately misrepresent the Sunnah, our only duty is to clearly convey the truth to whomever wishes to know it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
