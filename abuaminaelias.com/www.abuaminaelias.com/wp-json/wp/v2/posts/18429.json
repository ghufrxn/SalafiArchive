In their view, Islam allows no permanent or stable peace with the non-Muslim world. Muslims, they say, must continue to advance their political interests by military means if necessary.

In fact, the virtue of peace in Islam demands that it be the most desirable outcome possible.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, the concept of \u201coffensive jihad\u201d as expressed in classical Islamic legal texts has been dangerously misunderstood. The Quran and Sunnah consistently express defense as the overriding aim of warfare. The rules of war were amended near the end of the Quranic revelation to include preemptive strikes as a tactic, but not as an end in itself. The understanding of offense by the majority of jurists did not include political rule or domination of non-Muslims as a\u00a0goal by itself. The general purpose of jihad as defense has never changed since it was first permitted.<\/p>\n<p>Ideas of offensive jihad in the hands of untrained and uneducated lay Muslims, as well as anti-Muslim activists, are dangerous because it permits no vision of stable peace between the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds. It also conflicts with the essence of Allah as peace (<em>al-Sala\u0304m<\/em>) and thus peace on earth as something to strive for. The very integrity of Islamic practice is threatened if worldly political goals supersede the values, virtues, and spiritual teachings of our religion. As Muslims, we should remove this misunderstanding as it is an obstacle to peace, stability, and mutual-respect among the people of the world.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
