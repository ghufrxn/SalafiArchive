Ibn Al-Qayyim says in Al-Manar al-Munif 115 that the sub-narrator &#8216;Ali ibn Zayd is weak and his traditions have been rejected.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout history, groups of Muslims have used such traditions and symbols like the black flag to attribute themselves to Al-Mahdi, a righteous ruler who will appear near the end of time. Perhaps among the first to do so was the Abbasid dynasty who carried black banners and referred to their Caliphs as Al-Mahdi in an attempt to legitimize their rule.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise in modern times was the insurgency of Juhayman Al-Otaybi in 1979 wherein his followers violated the sanctity of Islam by attacking and killing the Muslims of Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. They declared that a man among them was the promised Al-Mahdi and therefore Muslims were obligated to support their violent rebellion.<\/p>\n<p>In the same way, we expect impostors and pretenders to continue using weak traditions and specious arguments to deceive ignorant Muslims into supporting their misguided ambitions. Rather, any group that calls to Islam must be judged by the actions of its members and the character of its leaders.<\/p>\n<p>Those who declare ordinary Muslims to be unbelievers, justify spilling their blood, and seizing their property have nothing to do with Islam even if they recite the Quran and carry Islamic symbols. Indeed, it has been authentically reported that the Khawarij sect recites the Quran, yet they are the worst of the creation and the dogs of Hellfire.
