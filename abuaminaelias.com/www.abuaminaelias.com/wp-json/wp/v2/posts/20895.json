It contains at least two narrators whose status is doubtful. Hence, all of the transmissions of this tradition contain weakness and thus it is not an appropriate proof in matters of theology or law.<\/p>\n<p>If, for the sake of argument we say the tradition of Thawban is authentic, does it apply to current political events like those in Kashmir? It seems likely that the tradition would refer to the activities of the earliest Muslims, such as Rightly-Guided Caliphs who engaged the Indian frontier according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/yaqeeninstitute.org\/justin-parrott\/jihad-as-defense-just-war-theory-in-the-quran-and-sunnah\/\">Islamic principles of just war<\/a>, which protect civilians and strictly limit the scope of violence. It definitely does not refer to some Muslim empires in history or modern terrorists who committed transgressions in India.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the tradition should be interpreted as <em>descriptive<\/em> and not <em>prescriptive<\/em>. That is, it describes a group of Muslims who fight a just war against Indian forces according to the strict guidance of the Quran and Sunnah. It does not mean that war against India is desirable or good in itself.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the way many people have circulated and applied these traditions to current political events is inappropriate. Every believer should want injustices to be resolved with the least amount of violence and harm possible, and it is even more dangerous that two countries in tension are armed with nuclear weapons of mass destruction.<\/p>\n<p>We ask Allah to relieve innocent believers and civilians of suffering and oppression, and to guide us to ways of reconciliation and cooperation.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes
