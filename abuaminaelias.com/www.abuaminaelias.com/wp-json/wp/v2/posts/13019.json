When the evidence is presented in context, we find that the allegation is baseless.<\/p>\n<p>Scholars disagree concerning the age of Aisha when she married the Prophet, the earliest estimate being that she was nine-years old. This means that the marriage contract was ratified after Aisha reached puberty, which was considered adulthood in ancient Arab society. A marriage between an older man and a younger woman was customary and socially appropriate in that era, considering that such marriages were an important means of survival in a harsh desert environment and that people had much lower life expectancy than they have today.<\/p>\n<p>Colin Turner of the University of Durham Middle East Studies department explains the context of the Prophet\u2019s marriage:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A marriage between an older man and a young girl was customary among the Bedouins, as it still is in many societies across the world today. It was not unheard of in Muhammad\u2019s time for boys and girls to be promised to each other in marriage almost as soon as they were born, particularly if the union was of direct political significance to the families concerned. However, such marriages were almost certainly not consummated until both parties had entered adulthood, which Arabs in the 7th century tended to reach at an earlier age than Westerners today. It is highly unlikely that Muhammad would have taken Aisha into his bed until she was at least in her early teens, which was wholly in keeping with the customs of the day, and in context not in the least improper.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Turner, Colin. <em>Islam: the basics,<\/em>\u00a0Routledge 2006, p. 34-35.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, Karen Armstrong writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There was no impropriety in Muhammad&#8217;s betrothal to Aisha. Marriages conducted in absentia to seal an alliance were often contracted at this time between adults and minors who were even younger than Aisha. This practice continued in Europe well into the early modern period. There was no question of consummating the marriage until Aisha reached puberty, when she would be married off like any other girl.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Armstrong, Karen. <i>Muhammad: a prophet for our time<\/i>, Harper Collins 2006, p. 105.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Christian tradition records a similar marriage between the much older Joseph to the young Virgin Mary. The Catholic Encyclopedia\u00a0states:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A year after his wife\u2019s death, as the priests announced through Judea that they wished to find in the tribe of Juda a respectable man to espouse Mary, then twelve to fourteen years of age. Joseph, who was at the time ninety years old, went up to Jerusalem among the candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Knight, Kevin. <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newadvent.org\/cathen\/08504a.htm\">The Catholic Encyclopedia<\/a><\/em>.

This they can never do.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, marriage in Islam is not simply about sex. Marriage is a spiritual agreement based upon \u201c<b>love and mercy<\/b>\u201d (30:21). Ratifying a marriage contract does not necessitate sex. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Prophet had sex with Aisha before puberty.
