She may forego her entitlement to financial maintenance, residence, and regular companionship, while the husband may enjoy sexual intimacy with her whenever he visits her. What is the status of this arrangement in Islam?<\/p>\n<p>This type of marriage is highly controversial for good reason, as it is being abused in practice. It was originally designed to accommodate men who travel often or may not have the resources for a full marriage, while also providing divorcees and widows with much-needed companionship. These are valid concerns that need suitable answers and any roadblock preventing good people from enjoying the full benefits of marriage should be removed. However, the practice of <em>misyar<\/em> has failed to resolve these social problems and, in addition to being of questionable legitimacy in Islam, has instead created even more unintended harm.<\/p>\n<p>The basis of <em>misyar<\/em> is the idea that a woman may consent to a limited amount of rights in her marriage contract. A similar arrangement in the time of the Salaf was known as \u2018daytime marriage\u2019 (<em>nikah al-nahariyyat<\/em>), in which a husband only visited his wife during the day or an otherwise limited amount of time. Some early scholars saw nothing wrong with this, but others viewed it as morally objectionable.<\/p>\n<p>Hisham reported:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0633\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0646\u0650\u0643\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Sirin disapproved of the daytime marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Mus\u0323annaf Ibn Abi\u0304 Shaybah 16560<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Shu\u2019bah reported:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0647\u064f<\/p>\n<p>Hammad disapproved of it.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Mus\u0323annaf Ibn Abi\u0304 Shaybah 16562<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Another arrangement more closely tied to today\u2019s <em>misyar<\/em> were marriages in which a husband restricted the amount of financial rights his wife would enjoy.

These are all important issues, but the solution does not lie in legal stratagems or loopholes as a means to side-step the serious prohibition of adultery. Rather, the answer is to revive the pure Sunnah in regards to these issues: discouraging exorbitant dowries and extravagant weddings, removing the stigma of remarriage from divorcees and widows, implementing a routine of fasting as a cure for sexual frustration, and generally promoting a family-friendly marriage culture.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows
