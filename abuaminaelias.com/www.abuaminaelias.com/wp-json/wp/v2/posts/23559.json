The legal principle governing customs, and by extension customary or discretionary laws, is that all customs are permissible unless there is evidence in the Sharia to forbid them.<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Taymiyyah writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0633\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a \u062f\u064f\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0627\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0638\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0638\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0625\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0638\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0647\u064f \u060c \u0648\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0652\u064a\u064e \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0627 \u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0651 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0628\u064f\u062a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e \u064a\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0628\u064f\u062a\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u0650\u064a\u064c\u0651 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e \u064a\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0638\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c<\/p>\n<p>With regard to customs, they are things that people are used to doing in their worldly affairs. The basic principle concerning them is that they are not forbidden. None of that is forbidden except what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. That is because commands and prohibitions have to do with the religion of Allah, and acts of worship must necessarily be enjoined. If something is not proven to have been enjoined, then how can it be deemed an act of worship? With regard to customs, if there is no text to prove that a custom is forbidden, how can it be deemed to be forbidden?<\/p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0Majmu\u2018 al-Fatawa 29\/16-17<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, all acts of worship are impermissible unless proven by the Sharia to be lawful, and all social customs are permissible unless proven by the Sharia to be unlawful.<\/p>\n<p>A modern example would be laws governing vehicle traffic; nothing explicit is mentioned about them in the Quran and Sunnah, obviously, since such vehicles did not exist at the time. However, the principles of the Sharia, such as the welfare of the public, inspire the institution of such customary laws to make the roads safe for passengers. Even though they are \u201csecular\u201d laws, that is, not explicitly religious in origin, they still have a basis in the objectives of the Sharia and are therefore valid and must be obeyed by Muslim and non-Muslim citizens.<\/p>\n<p>A final point of great importance is to appreciate how the technical terms used by later scholars might differ from the linguistic meaning found in the Quran and Sunnah. Fiqh is such an example of this shift in language. In the time of the Prophet (s\u0323), Fiqh and its derivatives simply meant understanding the religion in its complete sense, inwardly and outwardly. Later on, scholars used the term Fiqh to designate the specific branch of knowledge governing the outward rules of the religion.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u062f\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0642 \u0622\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0648\u0633 \u0648\u0645\u0641\u0633\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062d\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0628\u062d\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0634\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0639\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 &#8230; \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0625\u0646\u0630\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0648\u064a\u0641 \u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0631\u062f \u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0632\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0634\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647<\/p>\n<p>The term <em>Fiqh<\/em> in the first generation was used for knowledge of the path to the Hereafter, recognizing the subtleties of the souls, deeds that corrupt them, the capacity to comprehend the base nature of the world, strong aspirations for the pleasures of the Hereafter, and fear of Allah overtaking the heart\u2026 It did not primarily mean the complex rules of divorce, emancipation of slaves, oaths over accusations of adultery, pre-delivery of merchandise, or rental agreements, for that does not achieve admonition, nor fear of Allah.

Fiqh (\u201cunderstanding the religion\u201d), as used in the Quran and Sunnah, means actualizing the comprehensive Sharia, inwardly and outwardly, as well as its derivative principles.<\/p>\n<p>Mu\u2019awiyah reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0631\u0650\u062f\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0641\u064e\u0642\u0651\u0650\u0647\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650<\/p>\n<p><strong>To whomever Allah wills goodness, He grants him understanding <\/strong>(<em>yufaqqihhu<\/em>) <strong>of the religion<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Source: S\u0323ah\u0323i\u0304h\u0323 al-Bukha\u0304ri\u0304 71, Grade:\u00a0<strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abuaminaelias.com\/dailyhadithonline\/2011\/08\/20\/if-allah-intends-good-fiqh\/\">Muttafaqun Alayhi<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The outward rules contained in technical Fiqh are certainly part of the religion and it is a collective obligation upon Muslims to retain this knowledge. But not recognizing the linguistic shift in the term obscures essential parts of the religion from the public. Some Muslims mistakenly think the religion is almost entirely technical Fiqh, its outward rules, which leads them to neglect Islam\u2019s ethical, spiritual, and psychological insights.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, the three types of law in Islam are Sharia, Fiqh, and Qanun. Sharia is the foundation based upon the decisive inward and outward rules instituted by the Quran and Sunnah covering theology, ethics, and law. Fiqh is the additional human attempt to expand the application of the Sharia to new contexts or questions unanswered by the divine texts. Qanun is customary and discretionary law that is not directly derived from Sharia or Fiqh, but which serves the objectives of the Sharia and contains no elements the Sharia might consider unlawful. Understanding these three types of law and their mutual interaction is critical for Muslims to reassert the relevance of Islamic law in the modern age.<\/p>\n<p><em>Success comes from Allah, and Allah
