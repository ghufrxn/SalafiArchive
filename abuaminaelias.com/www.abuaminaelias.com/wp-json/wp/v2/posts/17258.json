The term &#8220;rape&#8221; (<em>ightis\u0323a\u0304b<\/em>) in the classical legal literature was applied only to forced sexual relations outside of the marriage contract. Rape in this sense has always been unlawful and prosecuted in the legal category of adultery based upon the Prophet&#8217;s practice and a firm legal consensus.<\/p>\n<p>The original term\u00a0<em>ightis\u0323a\u0304b\u00a0<\/em>linguistically means to take something forcefully without having a right to it in the first place. Since a man has the right to have sexual relations with this wife as granted by the marriage contract, he is not taking something for which he inherently has no right. Consent was a moral requirement, but had no legal ramifications. Hence, the ruling of adultery does not apply to the husband in this case.<\/p>\n<p>However, the meaning of &#8220;rape&#8221; has changed with the times, as it now means any forced sexual intercourse even within marriage. The reason for this change is that Western legal traditions shifted the basis of lawful sexual relations from contract to consent. The marriage contract alone originally made sexual relations lawful, but now it is consent that legalizes sexual relations. This gave rise to the concept of marital rape and has influenced the legal discourse in Muslim countries.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of marital rape as a legal category did not appear in any law tradition until the year 1949, which makes it difficult to locate a precedent in pre-modern law. Islamic law developed through the practice of issuing a <em>fatwa\u0301<\/em> (legal\u00a0judgment) as applied to a particular case. If such a case never arose, there would be no point in issuing a judgment about it. In this way, Islamic law was mostly a practical and not theoretical exercise. This means Muslim jurists have\u00a0not\u00a0discussed marital rape as such until\u00a0the modern period.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, forced sexual intercourse within marriage falls under another prohibited legal category in Islamic law: harming the wife. The classical scholars upheld the fundamental right of a wife to be free from harm. If a man forces his wife into sexual intercourse against her will, he can only do so by harming her and this makes his action unlawful. Marital rape, then, is more properly understood as an issue of domestic violence, an issue that was well-known to Muslim jurists since the time of the Prophet until today and for which we have ample precedent.<\/p>\n<p>The principle of removing harm is an essential legal axiom (<em>al-qawa\u0304\u02bbid al-fiqhiyya<\/em>) in the orthodox schools of Islamic law, as it forms the basis and rationale of so many rules in Islam.<\/p>\n<p>Ubaida ibn As-Samit reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, issued a decree:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0644\u0627\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u0636\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do not cause harm or return harm.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Source: Sunan ibn Majah 2340, Grade:\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/dailyhadith.abuaminaelias.com\/2011\/12\/03\/hadith-on-islamic-law-do-not-be-harmed-or-harm-others\/\">Hasan<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And the juristic principle is stated as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0627\u0644\u0636\u064e\u0651\u0631\u064e\u0631 \u064a\u064f\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0644<\/p>\n<p>Harm should be removed.<\/p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/dailyhadith.abuaminaelias.com\/2012\/12\/19\/as-suyuti-on-jurisprudence-the-five-principles-of-the-school-of-imam-ash-shafiee\/\">Al-ashba\u0304h wa-al-naz\u0323a\u0304\u02bcir 7<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The classical scholars often stated this as an explicit right of the wife when discussing the rights and duties of marriage in general.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064f \u0645\u064f\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0651\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0630\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e<\/p>\n<p>Their husbands must not harm them, in the same way that they have rights over their wives.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Al-Ja\u0304mi\u02bb li-ah\u0323ka\u0304m al-Qur\u02bca\u0304n 2:228<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And Az-Zamakhshari writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0639\u064e\u0646\u0651\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0651\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0635\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f<\/p>\n<p>Neither spouse should be violent against his or her companion.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Al-Kashsha\u0304f \u02bban h\u0323aqa\u0304\u02bciq 2:228<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And Al-Baydawi writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u064e\u062d\u064f\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0642\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064f \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0648\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627<\/p>\n<p>Among her rights is the dowry, to be free from harm, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Anwa\u0304r al-tanzi\u0304l 2:228<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And Ar-Razi writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u064a\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0631\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064d \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0651\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062c\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u0642\u0651\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0622\u062e\u064e\u0631\u0650<\/p>\n<p>No harm should come to her.

She does not have a valid excuse to refuse him such as being preoccupied or ill or tired. Rather, she refuses him out of a mean-spirited attitude only. This is a violation of the terms of the marriage contract and therefore a sin, and it might also tempt\u00a0the husband to satisfy his natural impulse in an unlawful manner. If the\u00a0husband spends the entire night in his house angry with her, it causes\u00a0the angels to curse her until the morning.<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet warns such women of the negative moral consequences of this inexplicable behavior, but he gives no concession to the husband to take his right by force. If forced sexual compliance was an acceptable option, we could reasonably infer that the Prophet would have mentioned\u00a0it here but he did not. Hence, the tradition is an implicit proof against marital rape and, by analogy, against the rape of concubines as well.<\/p>\n<p>The classical scholars determined that a man does not have the right to have sexual relations with his wife if he harms her, as this is a violation of her rights and the Islamic values of mercy and honorable behavior.
