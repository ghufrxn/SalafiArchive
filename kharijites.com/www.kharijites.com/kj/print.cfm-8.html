<p>There are to be found in the field today, Khārijites, from the remnants of the <b>Quṭbīs, Surūrīs, Taḥrīrīs, Takfīrīs</b> and their likes, knowing that they cannot openly profess their falsehood because of what has taken place of the rejection against ISIS and the establishment of the proof by the followers of the Salaf that they are Khāriiites like the first Muḥakkimah, and the Azāriqah after them. So now, they are clinging to shubuhāt which have been demolished aforetime, and which they use as  a stepping stone to continue their call to the doctrine of the Khārijites, but this time in "<b>safe mode</b>".  These people are scorpions and snakes and they should be refuted, exposed and warned against for their ignorance and and their camouflaged call to deviation and extremism. From their tactics is to falsely ascribe rebellion to some of the Salaf or to use isolated instances from some of the Salaf--who were declared erroneous for what they fell into of fighting or rebellion--and through that, overturn the foundations of the Sunnah that are agreed upon by the Salaf and those Imams upon their way.     <p>
Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr (d. 463) is from the Mālikī scholars and he said in al-Iistidhkār (5/16):    <p>
<blockquote><p><div class='arabic' dir='rtl'>وَأَمَّا جَمَاعَةُ أَهْلِ السُّنَّةِ وَأَئِمَّتُهُمْ فَقَالُوا هَذَا هُوَ الِاخْتِيَارُ أَنْ يَكُونَ الْإِمَامُ فَاضِلًا عَالِمًا عَدْلًا مُحْسِنًا قَوِيًّا عَلَى الْقِيَامِ كَمَا يَلْزَمُهُ فِي الْإِمَامَةِ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فَالصَّبْرُ عَلَى طَاعَةِ الْإِمَامِ الْجَائِرِ أَولَى مِنَ الْخُرُوجِ عَلَيْهِ لِأَنَّ فِي مُنَازَعَتِهِ وَالْخُرُوجِ عَلَيْهِ اسْتِبْدَالَ الْأَمْنِ بِالْخَوْفِ وَإِرَاقَةَ الدِّمَاءِ وَانْطِلَاقَ أَيْدِي الدَّهْمَاءِ وَتَبْيِيتَ الْغَارَاتِ عَلَى الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَالْفَسَادَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَهَذَا أَعْظَمُ مِنَ الصَّبْرِ عَلَى جَوْرِ الجائر</div></blockquote>    <p>
<blockquote><p>As for the jamāʿah of Ahl al-Sunnah, and their leading imāms, they said: This is the chosen (viewpoint) that the ruler (imām) should be virtuous, knowledgeable, just, righteous (muḥsin), strong in establishment (of his duty), as is required of him in leadership. And if he is not as such, then patience in obeying the tyrannical ruler is better than rebelling against him. This is because in contending for rule with him and rebelling against him leads to replacing security with fear and shedding of blood and and letting loose the hands of the common people, and the hatching of incursions (attacks) upon Muslims, and corruption on the earth. And this is greater (in evil) than patience upon tyranny of the tyrant.</p></blockquote>    <p>
