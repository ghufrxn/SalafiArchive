<p>Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Fawzān was asked (<a href="dld-11.cfm?a=gherjc">listen to audio</a>):     <p>
<blockquote><p>When is a man labelled as being among the Khārijites? When he performs one of their actions is he counted amongst them? Or is it necessary that he believes in [their beliefs] and acts with all of their actions?</p></blockquote>    <p>
The Shaykh answered:     <p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever performs the action of the Khārijites and speaks with their statement, he is considered to be from the Khārijites. The Khārijites are those who revolt against the ruler of the Muslims and split the ranks of obedience. Whoever believes this belief [of rebelling] or enacted it against the ruler of the Muslims is from the Khārijites. <u>Likewise</u>, the one who makes takfīr of Muslims on account of major sins which are found with them, this is the doctrine of the Khārijites. Whoever declared Muslims disbelievers, he declared one from the Muslims a disbeliever on account of a sin that is less than shirk, then he is considered to be among the Khārijites. This is the doctrine of the Khārijites, we ask Allāh for pardon.</p></blockquote>    <p>

The Shaykh also said:     <p>
<blockquote><p>The Khārijites and the Muʿtazilah who revolt against the profligate rulers. <font style='font-size:11px;'>[Sharḥ ʿAqīdat al-Imām al-Mujaddid Muḥammad bin ʿAbd al-Wahhāb (Dār al-Minhāj, 1426H) p. 128]</font></p></blockquote>    <p>
Abu ʿIyāḍ  @abuiyaadsp<br>  20 Muharram 1438 / 21 October 2016    <p>
<b>Note: </b> As is known and established in the books of history and creed that it is not a condition for being a Khārijite that one must make takfīr of Muslims on account of sin. Thus, what is done by members of al-Qaeda, ISIS and their spiritual leaders (or former ones) such as Abū Qatādah, Abū Muḥammad al-Maqdisī and others of denying that they make takfīr of Muslims by way of sin or apply general rulings of takfīr upon whole societies is deception by which they delude the ignorant and also deceive ignorant, uninformed Western academics. Believing in the permissibility of revolting against a Muslim ruler (due to his sin and oppression, let alone perceived disbelief) is a matter separate to making takfīr of Muslims by way of major sins. The former is what unites all Khārijites and is the central core of their innovated religion. As for making takfīr of Muslims on account of sins or of whole societies, these are later developments amongst the Khārijites and not all of them subscribe to these doctrines. Thus, there are refutations between the Khārijites themselves, and some refer to others as Khārijites. Hence, we see the hardcore Khārijite, Abū Muḥammad al-Maqdisī refute those amongst his followers who make takfīr of Muslims on account of major sins or of whole societies. Alongside this, al-Maqdisī remains a hardcore Khārijite because the central core of his innovated religion still remains, he has not recanted it.    <p>
