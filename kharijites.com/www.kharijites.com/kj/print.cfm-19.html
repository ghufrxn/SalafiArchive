<p>Qatādah (118H) is a famous Qurʾanic commentator who studied with some of the Prophet’s Companions and also with the students of Ibn ʿAbbās), the greatest scholar of the Qurʾān. He said regarding the verse: “<b>It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allāh and those deeply-rooted in knowledge</b>...” (3:7),     <p>
<blockquote><p>If they are not the Ḥarūrites [Khārijites] or the Sabaʾites, then I do not know who they are.</p></blockquote>    <p>
