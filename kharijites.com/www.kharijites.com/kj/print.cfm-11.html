His anterior hides behind the label of ‘Salafī-Jihādist’. Meanwhile, his posterior excretes Khārijite ideology, which includes takfīr on account of what does not amount to sin let alone what amounts to sin. His easily identified core Khārijite concepts are derived through the writings of Quṭb and al-Mawdūdī (see   <a href="articles/cgnfrvbob-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisis-kharijite-ideology-outlined-qutb-and-al-mawdudi.cfm.html?cgnfrvbob">here</a>, and <a href="articles/yakyesluw-kharijite-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisi-great-teacher-shaykh-and-mujahid-sayyid-qutb.cfm.html?yakyesluw">here</a>) and are similar to those of the Khārijites of old in focusing around issues of taḥkīm, ḥākimiyyah and khurūj as quintessential elements of faith. In his works and writings, he makes takfīr of all contemporary Muslim rulers and governments, their army and police divisions and any subsidiary institutions, as well as scholars and employees who actively support them. He considers their removal from the greatest of religious obligations, without which the foundation of Islām, Īmān and Tawḥīd cannot be established. This core doctrine forces him to concur with the sects of the Khārijites of old in their subsidiary doctrines and oppressive judgements, save that he denies it with his tongue and pen. Agreeing with the Khārijites in substance, he plays word-games with labels and titles to camouflage his corrupt merchandise.  </div><br> <p> 



<p>In his 1985 work, “Millah Ibrahīm” the Khārijite renegade and ideological terrorist, Abū Mūhammad ʿIṣām al-Barqāwī al-Maqdisī  - makes the Qurʾānic story of Ibrahīm (ʿalayhis-salaam) and his statements of disavowal (barāʾ) of the nation of idol and star worshippers he was raised amongst as a foundation for his perception and position towards contemporary Muslim nations and societies – indicating the severity of his ignorance and intense deficiency in his intellect – essentially taking verses that relate to those who are in principle an unbelieving nation, to a believing nation, Muslims.     <p>
