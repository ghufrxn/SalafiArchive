<p><blockquote><p>The neo-Khārijites and those upon error claim that the “madhhab of the Salaf” was to <a href='tags/revolt.cfm.html'><font class='tagLnk'>revolt</font></a> against the rulers who do not fulfil the rights and oppress people. And in this respect they draw upon actions of some of the Salaf that were criticised by the most senior of the people of knowledge in that time, from the Companions, and likewise which were explained by great scholars such as Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah as being erroneous in nature and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous ḥadīths. We  present here statements of al-Nawawī and Ibn Hajar in this regard. </p></blockquote>    <p>
