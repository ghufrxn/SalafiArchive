His anterior hides behind the label of ‘Salafī-Jihādist’. Meanwhile, his posterior excretes Khārijite ideology, which includes takfīr on account of what does not amount to sin let alone what amounts to sin. His easily identified core Khārijite concepts are derived through the writings of Quṭb and al-Mawdūdī (see   <a href="articles/cgnfrvbob-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisis-kharijite-ideology-outlined-qutb-and-al-mawdudi.cfm.html?cgnfrvbob">here</a>, and <a href="articles/yakyesluw-kharijite-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisi-great-teacher-shaykh-and-mujahid-sayyid-qutb.cfm.html?yakyesluw">here</a>) and are similar to those of the Khārijites of old in focusing around issues of taḥkīm, ḥākimiyyah and khurūj as quintessential elements of faith. In his works and writings, he makes takfīr of all contemporary Muslim rulers and governments, their army and police divisions and any subsidiary institutions, as well as scholars and employees who actively support them. He considers their removal from the greatest of religious obligations, without which the foundation of Islām, Īmān and Tawḥīd cannot be established. This core doctrine forces him to concur with the sects of the Khārijites of old in their subsidiary doctrines and oppressive judgements, save that he denies it with his tongue and pen. Agreeing with the Khārijites in substance, he plays word-games with labels and titles to camouflage his corrupt merchandise.  </div><br> <p> 



<p>Abū Muḥammad al-Maqdisī made takfīr of the most senior scholars of Saudī Arabia for their condemnation of the 1996 terrorist attack in al-Khobar. It was later established that the Saudī Ḥizbollah supported by Irān were behind the attack. The Khārijite hound accused them of:     <p>
<blockquote><p>...having completely withdrawn from Tawḥīd, aligning with the false deities (ṭāwāghīt) and  with shirk and tandīd (associating partners and rivals to Allāh)...</p></blockquote>    <p>
