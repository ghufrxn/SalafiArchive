<p><div style="padding:20px;background-color:#ffffdd;border-top:1px solid #cdcdcd;border-bottom:1px solid #cdcdcd;text-align:justify;"><img src="assets/images/kharijite-maqdisi.png" class="img-rounded" align="right" style="margin:2px 0px 5px 10px;" border="0"> <b>Abū Muḥammad al-Maqdisī ʿIṣām al-Barqāwī</b> is a chief ideological instigator of extremism and terrorism and one of the main inspirations behind al-Qaeda and ISIS takfīrī, jihādī ideology. His anterior hides behind the label of ‘Salafī-Jihādist’. Meanwhile, his posterior excretes Khārijite ideology, which includes takfīr on account of what does not amount to sin let alone what amounts to sin. His easily identified core Khārijite concepts are derived through the writings of Quṭb and al-Mawdūdī (see   <a href="articles/cgnfrvbob-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisis-kharijite-ideology-outlined-qutb-and-al-mawdudi.cfm.html?cgnfrvbob">here</a>, and <a href="articles/yakyesluw-kharijite-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisi-great-teacher-shaykh-and-mujahid-sayyid-qutb.cfm.html?yakyesluw">here</a>) and are similar to those of the Khārijites of old in focusing around issues of taḥkīm, ḥākimiyyah and khurūj as quintessential elements of faith. In his works and writings, he makes takfīr of all contemporary Muslim rulers and governments, their army and police divisions and any subsidiary institutions, as well as scholars and employees who actively support them. He considers their removal from the greatest of religious obligations, without which the foundation of Islām, Īmān and Tawḥīd cannot be established. This core doctrine forces him to concur with the sects of the Khārijites of old in their subsidiary doctrines and oppressive judgements, save that he denies it with his tongue and pen. Agreeing with the Khārijites in substance, he plays word-games with labels and titles to camouflage his corrupt merchandise.  </div><br> <p> 



<p>Abū Muḥammad al-Maqdisī is the second most influential Takfīrī Khārijite renegade, second only to Imām bin ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz (Sayyid Imām), in promoting the doctrine and methodology of the Khārijites in the modern era. He was nurtured upon the books of Sayyid Quṭb and Mawdūdī whilst in in Afghanistan during the mid-1980s, being trained by Jamāʿat al-Takfīr. The Khārijites have a number of positions towards the inhabitants of what they consider the abode of disbelief. The first is to consider them all disbelievers, as we have seen from the Bayhasites.     <p>
