His anterior hides behind the label of ‘Salafī-Jihādist’. Meanwhile, his posterior excretes Khārijite ideology, which includes takfīr on account of what does not amount to sin let alone what amounts to sin. His easily identified core Khārijite concepts are derived through the writings of Quṭb and al-Mawdūdī (see   <a href="articles/cgnfrvbob-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisis-kharijite-ideology-outlined-qutb-and-al-mawdudi.cfm.html?cgnfrvbob">here</a>, and <a href="articles/yakyesluw-kharijite-abu-muhammad-al-maqdisi-great-teacher-shaykh-and-mujahid-sayyid-qutb.cfm.html?yakyesluw">here</a>) and are similar to those of the Khārijites of old in focusing around issues of taḥkīm, ḥākimiyyah and khurūj as quintessential elements of faith. In his works and writings, he makes takfīr of all contemporary Muslim rulers and governments, their army and police divisions and any subsidiary institutions, as well as scholars and employees who actively support them. He considers their removal from the greatest of religious obligations, without which the foundation of Islām, Īmān and Tawḥīd cannot be established. This core doctrine forces him to concur with the sects of the Khārijites of old in their subsidiary doctrines and oppressive judgements, save that he denies it with his tongue and pen. Agreeing with the Khārijites in substance, he plays word-games with labels and titles to camouflage his corrupt merchandise.  </div><br> <p> 



<p>The earlier Khārijites considered persistence (iṣrār) upon major sin without repentance to be major disbelief and hence they expelled the major sinners from Islām. The modern day Khārijites are saying the same thing in essence.  The essence of their position is that committing major sins in an organised, systematic way, and laying down guidelines rules that regulate how the sin is performed is evidence that it has been declared lawful as a matter of belief (istiḥlāl, ibāḥah). Hence, the end result of what the earlier Khārijites and the modern Khārijites profess is the same thing: Making takfīr of Muslims on account of major sins.     <p>
