<div class='sidebar'>The Imaam Abd al-Azeez bin Muhammad bin Sa'ud is the son of the leader of Dir'iyyah (Muhammad bin Sa'ud) with whom Shaykh Ibn Abd al-Wahhab made an alliance. Abd al-Azeez took over the leadership in 1179H after the death of his father, and he established the call to monotheism. He was described by Ibn Ghannaam al-Ahsaa'ee as a righteous man, fearful of Allaah, plentiful in dhikr, kind and merciful to his subjects, and he would not leave the  mosque after the Fajr <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> until the sun had risen and he would <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a> the forenoon (al-Duhaa prayer). He was very charitable to his subjects. He also sent many letters and short treatises to the scholars, judges and leaders, many of which are in print version and which will be presented in other articles inshaa'Allaah. </div>    <P>
What concerns us in this article is his death. He died in the year 1218H on Monday, 22nd of Rajab at the hands of a Raafidee (Shi'ite) who was from the town of al-Imaadiyyah in <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a>. Imaam Abd al-Azeez was in <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a> in the well-known mosque of al-Tarif in al-Dir'iyyah. Lutf Allaah Jihaaf writes in his book (<i>Durar Nuhoor al-Hoor al-Ayn Bi Seerah al-Imaam al-Mansur</i>, Sanaa, Yemen, 1st edition, p. 838):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>That which has been transmitted to us regarding the killing of Abd al-Aziz is that a man from the foreigners, from the (area of the) mash.had (tomb) of <a href='tags/al-husayn.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Husayn</font></a> reached al-Dir'iyyah, and began lying in wait for the activities of Abd al-Azeez and he used to wait in ambush, for an opportunity to kill him using deception, but he was not able to. Then eventually, he came close to the place in which he (Abd al-Azeez) would pray in the mosque, and prayed besides him during the Asr (afternoon) <a href='tags/prayer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prayer</font></a>. While he (Abd al-Azeez) was in <a href='tags/prostration.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>prostration</font></a>, he (the Raafidee) took out a knife and plunged it into him, and so he died ...</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This enmity from the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Raafidah</font></a> was because the Monotheistic call was opposed to their polytheistic practices of worshipping the saints and worshipping their graves and tombs and calling upon them for rescue from calamity and making offerings and presentations to them to elicit benefit or repel harm.     <P>
The enmity towards the monotheistic reform da'wah came from the Raafidee <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ah</font></a> and the Sufis, which on a political level are represented in the Ottoman state that was Hanafi Maturidi Sufi and the Raafidee <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ah</font></a> state (present day Iraan). There is a strong connection between the Shi'ites and the extreme Sufis' as it relates to aspects of their religious practices. Attachment to the graves and taking of saints for worship besides Allaah was historically transferred from the Shi'ites to the Sufis. This is beyond the scope of this article and will be covered elsewhere (<a href=http://www.tawhidfirst.com/>TawhidFirst.Com</a>) inshaa'Allaah. </blockquote>    <P>
