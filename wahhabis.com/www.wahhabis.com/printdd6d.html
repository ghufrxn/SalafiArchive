<div class='sidebar'>In much of the propaganda that comes from the Extreme Sufis, the Nusayris and the Raafidee <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shi'ah</font></a> you will hardly find a single first-hand citation from Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab in which he speaks of his creed and what he is upon. This is because there is not much they can find to vilify him and his da'wah and to support their claim that he opposes the Salaf and the four Imaams and the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah before him.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>A Written Letter Explaining His Belief</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This is from <i>al-Durar al-Saniyyah</i> (6th edition, 1996 1/29), and it is an excerpt of the beginning of a short treatise that was written in response to a request to Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab (rahimahullaah) that he write down and explain his creed, so he wrote:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/durar-sunniyyah-1-29.gif hspace=8 width=350 align=right hspace=8 vspace=6 border=0> In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, ever-Merciful (to His servants). I call Allaah to witness and those in my presence from the Angels, and I call you to witness that I believe what the saved sect (al-firqah al-naajiyah), Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah have believed, of having faith in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the resurrection after death, and faith in al-Qadr (the Divine Pre-decree), both its good and its evil. And from having faith in Allaah is [faith] in what He described Himself witht in His Book upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) without tahreef (distortion) or ta'teel (divestment). Indeed, I believe that Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted has none which is a likeness unto Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing. Thus, I do not negate from Him whatever He described Himself with, nor do I distort the words from their  proper places, nor do I deviate in Allaah's names and His verses, nor do I specify how or make likeness between His attributes, the Exalted, and the attributes of His creation. [This is because] there is no namesake (samiyy), or equal (kofu') or rival (nidd) for Him, and He is not analogised for with His creation, for He, the Sublime, is the most-knowledgeable of His own self and of others besides Him, and He is the most truthful in speech, and the best in statement. He purified and absolved Himself from the opposers have described Him with from the people of takyeef (specifying how) and tamtheel (making likeness) and from what the deniers have negated from Him from the people of tahreef (distortion) and ta'teel (divestment), so He said, "<b>Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him! And safety, peace be upon the Messengers. And all praise is due to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds</b>." (37:180-182)</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes</font>    <P>
In the above passage, Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab has explained his creed in al-Asmaa' wal-Sifaat (Names and Attributes) which does not depart from what the Compainions, Taabi'een and their followers, the four Imaams and the generality of the Salaf were upon, which is to make ithbaat (affirmation) of whatever Allaah has described Himself with and what His Messenger has described Him with, whilst negating tamtheel and takyeef from all of that.  <P>
