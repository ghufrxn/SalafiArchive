In the year 1184H Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab and Imaam Abd al-Azeez bin Muhammad bin Sa'ud sent a letter to the govenor of Makkah, al-Shareef Ahmad bin al-Shareef Sa'eed  through Shaykh Abd al-Aziz al-Haseen the text of which is as follows (al-Durar al-Saniyyah, 6th edition, 1417H, 1/55-56):    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/durar-sunniyyah-1-55.gif align=right width=350 hspace=8 vspace=3 border=0> In the name of Allaah, Most-Merciful, ever-Merciful (to His servants). A petition to you, may Allaah make continuous the most excellent of bounties upon you, the presence of the al-Shareef Ahmad bin al-Shareef Sa'eed, may Allaah make him lofty in both the abodes [of this life and the next] and make lofty through him, the religion of his ancestor, the chief [i.e. Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)] of the two worlds (jinn and men). Indeed when the letter reached the (humble) servant who reflected upon what it contained of good and benevolent words, he raised his hands up with supplication to Allaah to support al-Shareef since his intent was to aid the Muhammadan <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> and whoever followed it and [showing] enmity to whoever exited from it, and this is what is obligatory upon those in authority. And when you requested from our direction a student of knowledge, we fulfilled the command, and he is [on his way to] reaching you and he will sit in the counsel of al-Shareef, may Allaah strengthen him, [with both] he and the scholars of Makkah. So if they gather together (and are united), then all praise is due to Allaah for that, and if they differ, then the Shaykh will bring their books and the books of the Hanbalis (to judge in the matter). And that which is obligatory upon everyone amongst us is that he with his knowledge he ought to intend the face of Allaah and (intend to) support the His Messenger, just as He, the Exalted said, "<b>And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: "Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Wisdom, and afterwards (if) there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you, you must believe in him and support him.</b>" (3:81). So when He, the Sublime, has taken a covenant from the Prophets - if they were to reach Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [if he arrived] - to have faith in him and to aid him, then how about us, O his nation! Thus, faith in him is necessary and aiding him is necessary, and one of them is not sufficient without the other. And the most rightful of people of [providing] this (faith and support) and the most worthy of them are the Ahl al-Bayt, in the midst of whom Allaah sent him, and whom He honoured over the people of the earth. And the most rightful of the Ahl al-Bayt in that regard are those who are from his (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam's) offspring. Was-salaam.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This letter reveals the respect and honour with which Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab treated the Shareef of Makkah, making supplication for him, and fulfilling his request to send a person of knowledge to help him (and the Scholars of Makkah) to understand the nature of his call, and in this he was following the Prophetic guidance and the way of the Righteous Salaf towards those in authority. Many lies have been spread about Shaykh Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab through the claim that he was aggressive and fought Muslims, but the true and real picture is that when he called to the simple and pure monotheistic message - seeing people worship saints and venerate tombs and graves and being embezzled by charlatans posing as righteous men, and magicians and their likes - aggression and hostility was declared and shown towards him and his followers (much of it coming from those with vested interests), and many lies were spread on account of which he expended efforts in writing to certain leaders to dispel the false notions that he excommunicates Muslims and fights and kills them and disacknowledges the four Imaams and many other such claims.</blockquote>    <P>
