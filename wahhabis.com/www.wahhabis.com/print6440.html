Shaykh al-Isl&#257;m Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#703;Abd al-Wahh&#257;b was a peaceful preacher to whom enmity, hatred and violent aggression was shown because he educated the common people what is suggested by fi&#7789;rah, reason and revelation, to abandon invoking saints and instead to invoke All&#257;h alone. The spread of his message conflicted with the interests of authority figures in politics and religion. Centuries of bigotry, partisanship, intellectual decline and blind-following coupled with enmity were mobilised against his call and, in his own words, he only resorted to fighting in order to protect himself from unlawful, unjustified, oppressive violence. His enemies from the partisan religious authorities fabricated lies against him in order scare the common folk from him and to instigate and mobilise political authorities against him. From the slanders and fabrications made against him was that he makes generalised takf&#299;r of the ignorant masses  and demands that his opponents emigrate to him in order to validate their faith and other such lies, leading to the accusation of Kh&#257;rijism. Another faction, the actual Kh&#257;rijites in the manifestation of <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a>, <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a> and splinter groups exhibiting some of their qualities and stances such as the &#7716;add&#257;dites have in turn made the accusation of Irj&#257;&#702; against those who grant the excuse of ignorance (al-&#703;udhru bil-jahl) in matters of kufr and <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a>, require establishment of the proof (iq&#257;mat al-&#7717;ujjah) for takf&#299;r of specific individuals.      <P>
