<div class='sidebar'>  Mull&#257; &#703;Al&#299; al-Q&#257;r&#299; al-&#7716;anaf&#299; (d. 1014H) (rahimahull&#257;h) is an illustrious scholar to the &#7716;anaf&#299;s and he identified himself as M&#257;tur&#299;d&#299; in creed with leanings in S&#363;fism. He has a just, moderate and fair stance towards great scholars such as Shaykh al-Isl&#257;m Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahull&#257;h) and Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahull&#257;h). From this we can gather that among the &#7716;anaf&#299; M&#257;tur&#299;d&#299;s are: a) Those who are ignorant, blind, zealous fanatics who accuse scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim of tajs&#299;m and tashb&#299;h and b) Those who are learned, fair and just and who recognise that there is no basis upon which these scholars can be scorned and attacked and that what they were upon was what the Righteous Salaf of this ummah were upon and that if they made ijith&#257;ds for which they were criticised by those from other doctrinal schools, then at the very least, they are rewarded once.  <b><a href=assets/docs/maturidi-aliqari.pdf>Download PDF File (9 pages)</a></b>.  </div>    <P>
