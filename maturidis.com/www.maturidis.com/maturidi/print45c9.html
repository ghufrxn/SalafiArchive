<img src=assets/images/avatar-brown.gif align=left border=0> The Maturidi Madhhab developed further over the 200 years following the death of <a href='tags/abu-mansur-al-maturidi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Mansur al-Maturidi</font></a>, mainly through teaching as opposed to writing and authoring.    <P>
The students of al-Maturidi became a kalaamist faction that arose first in Samarqand, and they were <a href='tags/hanafi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanafi</font></a> in their fiqh (jurisprudence). Its adherents strove to spread the ideas of al-Maturidi, who was their Imaam, and it remained prominent in those lands, and, in later centuries, in the lands of Afghanistan and the Indian sub-continent. The most prominent figures in this period were <u>Abu al-Qasim Ishaaq bin Muhammad bin Ismaa'eel al-Hakeem as-Samarqandee</u> (d. 342H) and <u>Abu Muhammad Abdul-Kareem bin Eesaa al-Bazduwi</u> (d. 390H).    <P>
The fifth century after hijrah, 400H onwards, was still the formative period, and prominent figures in this century were <u>Abu al-Yusr Muhammad bin al-Husain ibn Abdul-Kareem al-Bazduwi</u> (d. 493H), and he was a Shaykh of the <a href='tags/hanafis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hanafis</font></a> in his time. His grandfather was Abdul-Kareem al-Bazduwi (d. 390H) mentioned above. He read the books of the Philosophers like al-Kindi and the books of the Mu'tazilah such as those of al-Ka'bee, al-Jubaa'ee and an-Nadhaam and prohibited from looking into them due to what they may cause of doubts. He also studied the works of al-Maturidi and rewrote them with better order and organization.     <P>
A large number of students took from Abu al-Yusr, and from them his son, <u>al-Qaadee Abu al-Ma'aanee Ahmad</u>, and <u>Najm ud-Deen Umar bin Muhammad an-Nasafee</u>, the author of "<i>al-Aqaa'id an-Nasafiyyah</i>" and others.    <P>
In this early period there was not much in the way of codification and formalization through written works. That took place over the next two centuries, from 500H onwards.   <P>
