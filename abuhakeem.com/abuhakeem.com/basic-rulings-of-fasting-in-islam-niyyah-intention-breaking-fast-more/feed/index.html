Baarakallahu feekum

Nam 1 thats correct the place of the niyyah is the heart and not upon the lips or tongue and that which is intended in the hadeeth is that a person takes his fill of whatever he is consuming as a pre-dawn meal whether it is literrally in his hand or in front of him Wallahu a&#039;lam]]></description>

as far as timetables are concerned then nam they should only be used as a guide and not clung to rigidly as they are subject to error. One uses them only as an approximation of the beginning of the time and then works with the factors laid down by the shariah to the best of ones ability Wallahu a&#039;lam]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand that when starting/ending one&#039;s fast, the sunnah is to look at the sky and not overburden oneself with the use of timetables. 
But in cities where the adhaan cannot be heard, it can be very difficult to know when true fajr has come in. 

Can we use timetables as a guide with the added precaution of (maybe) starting one&#039;s fast a few minutes before the time of fajr shown on a timetable?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JazakAllaahu khayran yaa Shaykhunaa.

Regarding point no. 1:
Is it permissbile to &quot;say&quot; the niyyah in one&#039;s heart without moving the tongue?

Regarding point no. 2:
You mentioned that it is permissible to take suhoor past the time of the beginning of fajr based on the hadeeth of the vessel still in one&#039;s hand...could that vessel be a plate/cup of food/drink in front of a person(on a table) or does the vessel of food/drink have to literally be in one&#039;s hand?]]></description>
