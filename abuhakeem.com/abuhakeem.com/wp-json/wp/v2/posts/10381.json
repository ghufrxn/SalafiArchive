Allah will rectify our affairs when we establish it, and our affairs will be on the verge of ruin with injustice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim<\/strong> Mentions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Allah has commanded with the establishment of Qist (Fairness and equity) and this is a reference to Justice. It is a command to establish it with regards to every individual, whether an enemy or an ally. The greatest thing one establishes justice in are the statements, opinions and positions one takes. Since this is connected to the command of Allah and that which He informs us of. Thus, establishing this justice is the duty of the successors of the messenger in this ummah, and the trustworthy ones from his followers. The title of being trustworthy is not deserved by the one who does not establish these things with pure justice and naseehah, to Allah and his book and his messenger towards his servants, these are the inheritors of the prophets in truth! Not the one who makes his companions, his way and his position, the standard and measure of the truth and its scales, showing enmity to those who oppose it and allegiance to those who agree with it, purely based on agreement or disagreement (with him). Where is this compared to the establishment of Qist that Allah has made compulsory upon every individual and it (Justice) in this regard, is of the greatest compulsion and mandatory nature<\/em>\u201d (Ar Risaalah At Tabookiyah: P34)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Heavens and the Earth were Established upon Justice.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar vein Shaikhul Islaam mentioned:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>The affairs of people in this world are set right with justice, even if that involves various types of sin, more than they are set right with injustice in rights, even if no sin is involved. This is why it is said: &#8216;Allah upholds a just state, even if it is disbelieving, but He does not uphold an oppressive state, even if it is Muslim.&#8217; It is also said: &#8216;The world endures with justice and disbelief, but it does not endure with injustice and Islam.&#8217; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;No sin is punished more swiftly in this world than oppression and severing family ties.&#8217; Thus, the oppressor is brought down in this world, even if he is forgiven and shown mercy in the Hereafter. This is because justice is the foundation of everything. If the affairs of the world are established with justice, they will thrive, even if their ruler has no share in the Hereafter. But if they are not established with justice, they will not thrive, even if their ruler has faith that will be rewarded in the Hereafter.<\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Due to the establishment of this justice, the prophet prohibited the testimony of certain individuals:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0On the authority of Abdullah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both), he said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The testimony of a treacherous man or woman is not accepted, nor that of one who harbours enmity against his brother, nor the testimony of someone who is dependent) on the household (such as a servant or someone paid for services).&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narrated by Ahmad (2\/204, 225-226) and Abu Dawud (3600) \u2013 classified as Hasan (sound) by Al-Albani in <em>Al-Irwa&#8217; (8\/284).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these individuals cannot be witnesses due to there being a factor affecting the just nature of their testimony.
