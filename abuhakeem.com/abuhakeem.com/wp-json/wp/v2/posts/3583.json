These periods are opportunities for the believer to increase in good and take advantage of the bounty and mercy of Allah during them. With the approach of the blessed ten days of Dhul Hijjah, we are drawing near to the best ten days of the year. It is these days that Allah swears by in the beginnings of Suratul Fajr when Allah says:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>(I swear) By the Dawn, and by the ten nights.<\/em><\/strong>.\u201d (Suratul fajr: 1-2)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the scholars of tafseer from the salaf (from them Ibn Abb\u0101s, Abdullah Ibn Zubair, Qat\u0101dah, Masrooq, \u2018Ikrimah,`Dah\u0101k and many others) held that this is a reference to the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah, a period of immense khair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, many of the scholars of Tafseer from the salaf (from them Abdullah Ibn Zubair, Al Aswad Ibn Yaz\u012bd An Nakha\u2019I, Masr\u016bq, Muj\u0101hid, Qat\u0101dah and others) held that the ten (i.e. the ten mentioned in the beginning of Suratul Fajr) are the ten of Al Adh\u2019haa (i.e. the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah) and Al Watr (the odd, a reference to the following verse \u201cand by the even and the odd\u201d ) is the day of Arafah, and Ash Shaf\u2019 (the even) is the day of Nahr (i.e. the day of Eid since Arafah is the 9<sup>th<\/sup> and the day of Nahr is the 10<sup>th<\/sup> of dhul Hijjah).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, Allah swears by the ten days generally, and further swears by two of its days specifically. There is no doubt then that these oaths of Allah fall upon something tremendous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allah Azz awa Jall Also refers to the days of Dhul hijjah as \u2018<strong><em>the known appointed days<\/em><\/strong>\u2019 in his statement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the name of Allah in the known appointed days<\/em><\/strong>\u2019  (Suratul Hajj: 28)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Abu Moosaa Al Ash\u2019ari, Mujaahid, Ataa\u2019 Sa\u2019eed Ibn Jubair, Al Hasan Al Basri Qatadah and others all held that this is a reference to the days of dhul Hijjah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu alaihi was Salam &#8211; mentioned, establishing the virtue of these days:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>There are no days that a person performs righteous actions within them more beloved to Allah than these days<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (i.e. the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah) They said \u2018Oh messenger of Allah! not even Jihad in the way of Allah?\u2019 he replied: &#8220;<strong><em>Not even Jihad in the way of Allah, except for the one that leaves out with his person and his wealth and returns with none of this (i.e. he is killed in the way of Allah)<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Collected by Al Bukh\u0101ri)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One version of the hadeeth mentions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>There are no days purer with Allah nor greater in reward..<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Collected by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd and declared \u2018<em>Saheeh<\/em>\u2019 by Shaikh Alb\u0101ni in \u2018Sah\u012bh Abi D\u0101w\u016bd (2017))<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al H\u0101fidh Ibn Rajab mentions commenting on this hadeeth: \u201c<em>The hadeeth of Ibn Abb\u0101s indicates that actions are multiplied during these ten with no exception for any of them<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among these ten days, is a day the Messenger \u2013 Sallallahu alaihi was salam refered to as \u201c<strong><em>The greatest days with Allah<\/em><\/strong>..\u201d in his statement \u201c<strong><em>Indeed the greatest days with Allah \u2013 Tabaaraka wa Ta\u2019alaa \u2013  are the day of nahr (Eid Al Adh\u2019h\u0101) and then the day of Qarr (the day of taking residence in Min\u0101 i.e. the day after Eid)<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Collected by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd and declared \u2018Saheeh\u2019 By Alb\u0101ni in Sah\u012bh Abu D\u0101w\u016bd (1549))<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, there are places wherein the reward for certain righteous actions are multiplied (such as salaah in Masjidul Har\u0101m) and there are times when actions are multiplied, these coming days are the greatest of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wa Sallallahu al\u0101 Nabiyin\u0101 Muhammad<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Explore the immense blessings and virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah, the best days of the year according to the Qur&#8217;an and Hadith.
