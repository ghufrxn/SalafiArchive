And if he had mercy upon them then that would be purely due to virtue from him and benevolence not because of their actions<\/em>..\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thus Ahlus Sunnah understand that the hadeeth is held to mean that if Allah were to punish all of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth he would do so because THEY WERE DESERVED OF PUNISHMENT hence he would not have wronged them.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with the speech of Al Hajoori is that his speech is connected to an earlier statement (as we mentioned in the beginning of the article these were merely bullet points and was not meant to be a breakdown of the issues)<\/p>\n<p>Al Hajoori mentions in \u2018Al Minnatul Ilaahiyah bi Sharhil Aqeedatus Safaareeniyah P153) quoting one of the mistakes of Imaam Safaareeni who said in some lines of poetry:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em><strong>And it is possible for our patron (Allah) to punish his creation * <strong>WITHOUT THEM HAVING SINNED OR COMMITED ANY CRIME<\/strong><\/strong><\/em>!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This statement of Safaareeni is the exact statement of the Jabariyah those who say that Allah does with us as he wills and our actions play no part in our outcome! Instead of doing that which all of the scholars who explain it do which is to hasten to highlight the error of this statement. And that it is in accordance to the belief of the Jabariyyah and that Ahlus Sunnah hold such and such.<\/p>\n<p>Instead he says:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What is <strong>EVEN BETTER<\/strong>(!) (Ahsan Min Haadhaa) than this, is the statement of Imaam At Tahaawi:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>He guides who he wills and he protects and pardons from his virtue. He misguides who he wills and he forsakes them and tests them from his justice, all of them revolve around his will, between his virtue and his justice<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>then he says:<\/p>\n<p>Allah says: \u201c <strong><em>He will not be asked about what he does but they will be asked<\/em><\/strong>\u201d(Suratul Anbiyaa 23)<\/p>\n<p>Allah pardons and is benevolent.<\/p>\n<p>He says: \u201c<strong><em>If it were not for the virtue of Allah upon you then none of you would be purified ever but indeed Allah purifies whosoever he wills<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratun Noor Vs 21)<\/p>\n<p>Then he quotes: \u201c<strong>So Virtue is for Allah before and after if Allah were to punish All of his worshippers he would not have oppressed them, and if he is merciful to them then it would be due to his virtue, his favour and his generosity<\/strong>..\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So as you can see the statement is devoid of the necessary explanation of the correct position of Ahlus Sunnah. And even though the statement of Imaam Tahaawi that he quotes is correct it does not sufficiently clarify the error or clarify the position of Ahlus Sunnah in regards to the Justice of Allah.<\/p>\n<p>So I ask you, what will the reader walk away with?<\/p>\n<p>Would he walk away correctly understanding the aqeedah of Ahlis Sunnah in relation to the justice of Allah and being clear about the error of As Safaarini or will he walk away with the aqeedah of the Jahmiyah (who are Jabariyah in regards to Qadr)?<\/p>\n<p>Where is the clarification that we would expect from a small student of knowledge much less \u2018An Naasihul Ameen!!<\/p>\n<p>So the issue is not an issue of quotation of Hadeeth alone!
