For how many close companions have been turned into enemies and much rancor has replaced love among us as a result of such machinations? And if these provocateurs truly understood what awaited them from punishment and humiliation, perhaps it would cause them to turn to All \u0101 h in penitence and repair the bonds their whispers have destroyed.
