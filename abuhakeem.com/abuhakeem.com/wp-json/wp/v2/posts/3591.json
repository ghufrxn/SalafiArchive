It was not practiced by the first three noble generations of the Muslim at all. Rather it was innovated in the 4<sup>th<\/sup> century by the F\u0101timids who were known as the Ubaidiy\u016bn and they were B\u0101tiniyah Ism\u0101&#8217;iliyah Shia, and not people of Sunnah. They not only innovated the celebration of the mawlid of the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam -, they also innovated alongside it, the celebration of the mawlid of F\u0101timah, Ali, Hasan, and Hussain \u2013 Radhiyallahu &#8216;Anhum. In its practice, is resemblance of the people of the book in celebrating the birth of Jesus, a practice that was not carried out by the disciples of Jesus. Thus here we present, 10 popular arguments used by those who carry the practice out, and brief responses to their arguments.<\/p>\n<p>Wa Billahit Tawf\u012bq.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211;\u00a0 used to fast on Mondays, when asked why he said: &#8220;<strong>That was the day I was born upon, and it was the day revelation (first) came down to me&#8221; {Muslim:1162 upon the authority of Abu Qatadah}<\/strong>\u2026thus he celebrated the day he was born!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: We do not reject the desirable nature of fasting on Mondays and its virtue, similarly fasting on Thursdays but we say, firstly, that the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; performed this throughout the year, every Monday and Thursday, and it goes without saying, that his day of birth was not <em>every<\/em> Monday of the year. Secondly, The Messenger and his companions performed this as an act of worship not celebration. Thirdly, this, in actuality, an evidence against you, since the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; prohibited that one should fast on the day of Eid!

Yet it is not prescribed for any of the two.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>You people say it is a bid&#8217;ah as though all bid&#8217;ah is bad! It may be a bid&#8217;ah But it is a bid&#8217;ah hasanah (A good bid&#8217;ah). The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever brings about in Islam a good Sunnah then he has the reward for it, and the reward of all who act upon it without their reward being diminished in any way<\/strong>&#8221; {Muslim: 1017}<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: There are no bid&#8217;ah hasanah! The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; said &#8220;<strong>EVERY bid&#8217;ah is misguidance<\/strong>..&#8221; The Intent behind the hadeeth is whoever practices an established Sunnah that had been left, or neglected, he revives it, and due to him this Sunnah is practiced. It does not refer to there being innovations that are considered good! The clearest proof of this, is present in the hadeeth itself! The reason The Messenger -Sallallahu Alaihi was Salam- made the statement, was because some poor people had come to the Messenger of Allah -Sallallahu Alaihi was Salam- and he requested from his companions to give charity to them. Some were slow to do so, and so one of the companions seeing this, hastened and gave charity. The rest of them then hastened to give charity, and so The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever brings about in Islam a good Sunnah..<\/strong>&#8221; Thus the question that has to be asked is, was the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; speaking of innovation or a sunnah that was already established? Of course giving in Charity was and is, an established Sunnah, therefore there is no evidence in this hadeeth for the statement.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>People have brought about actions that have been accepted by the Muslims for generations. For example Umar gathered the people in congregation for sal\u0101tul Tar\u0101w\u012bh and he made three pronouncements of divorce made in one sitting be considered as three, while that was not the case at the time of The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam -. Likewise Uthm\u0101n gather the qur&#8217;\u0101n together in one book, this was not done before. This is proof that not everything new thing must be rejected, if it is a good thing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: As far as the Tar\u0101w\u012bh issue, then the response to this is similar to point 6, it was something practiced by The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211;\u00a0 but he left it on the third night, after practicing it for two nights, fearing it would be made compulsory upon the ummah. Umar only revived the practice. As far as the Talaq issue and the gathering of the Qur&#8217;\u0101n then this falls under &#8220;The Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs that The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; commanded us to hold onto with our molar teeth in his statement<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Cling to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs, cling to it and hold onto it with your molar teeth..&#8221; {Abu Dawood: 4607 Declared Sah\u012bh By Shaikh Alb\u0101ni in Sah\u012bhul J\u0101mi 2549}<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Therefore this does not fall under blameworthy innovation especially since there was an established overall good in that which they legislated.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>The word \u0643\u0644 (every) does not always mean all. Therefore there are some exceptions to the rule like mawlid<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: The origin with the words of Allah and his messenger is that words are held upon their apparent meanings except if there is textual evidence indicating otherwise. Thus \u0643\u0644 means &#8216;every&#8217; wherever it occurs, unless there is clear textual evidence indicating the contrary. This does not exist here. In fact, the statement has a strong precursor of warning, emphasizing the fact that what is intended is <em>every<\/em> and <em>all<\/em> newly invented affairs in the religion. The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; said: &#8220;<strong>Beware of newly invented affairs, for indeed <u>ALL<\/u> newly invented matters are innovation and all innovations are in the fire<\/strong>&#8220;. So where is the evidence that &#8216;ALL&#8217; is not absolute?<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Abu Lahab was seen in a dream. It was said to him what is your state? He said: &#8220;<em>I am in the hellfire, but my punishment is lightened every Monday night due to my happiness with the birth of The Messenger, and due to me freeing Thuwaibah (the wet nurse of the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam)<\/em> &#8220;If this is the case with one of the worst of the kuf\u0101r that ever lived, then what about when the believer rejoices his happiness at the birth of the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu alaihi was Salam!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: The authentic version of the hadeeth occurs in Bukh\u0101ri (5201) The had\u012bth mentions that Abu Lahab was seen in a dream by one of his relatives, so he said to him what is your state? He replied &#8220;<em>I am in a wretched state but I am (occasionally) given something to drink through a hole like this (and he pointed to a small crevice between his thumb and index finger) because of my freeing Thuwaibah<\/em>&#8220;. Thus the authentic version of the hadeeth has no mention of his &#8216;Happiness with the birth of The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam. Secondly it doesn\u2019t occur in any of the sound sources of had\u012bth. Thirdly even if it were authentic (for argument sake), then the narrator of the dream is unknown, we do not know if he or she was Muslim or an unbeliever. Fourthly, apart from the dreams of The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; or the dreams of individuals that The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211;\u00a0 affirmed were true dreams (Like the dream of Abdullah Ibn Zaid when he heard the adh\u0101n before its legislation and the Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam &#8211; affirmed it was a true dream) peoples dreams are not a source of legislation!<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Do you prevent the remembrance of Allah and reciting the life of The Prophet &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam?!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>The Response<\/u><\/strong>: No we do not!
