Rather, Gabriel was the teacher of our Prophet (peace be upon him), and peace be upon Gabriel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ali al-Rida was indeed a figure of great stature and worthy of the caliphate. However, the Rafidah (Shi&#8217;a extremists) lied about him and exaggerated his status in ways that are impermissible.
