It began when a cunning and devilish man, who was either a road bandit or a tutor, with knowledge of poetry and historical accounts, and whose behaviour revealed heresy and apostasy, claimed to be a descendant of Ali and called people to follow him. Around him gathered highway robbers and black slaves from the servants of the people of Basra, until he amassed a considerable force. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They schemed and acquired swords and clubs, then rose up against the outskirts of the city. They spread corruption, killed, grew stronger, and were joined by every criminal. The evil they perpetrated escalated, so an army from Iraq marched to fight them, but the army was defeated. They seized Basra and plundered it, and the situation became dire. Their vile leader amassed a full-fledged army and prepared to march on Baghdad. He even built a great city for himself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Caliph al-Mu\u02bftamid was at a loss, and this wicked apostate\u2019s rebellion lasted for thirteen years. Armies feared him, and numerous battles and clashes took place, the details of which are lengthy and have been recorded by historians. Eventually, he was killed. The Zanj were essentially the slaves of Basra who rebelled with him\u2014may Allah not bless them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Siyar A&#8217;laamil &#8216;Ulamaa (12\/372))<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zanj Rebellion is one of the most prominent uprisings witnessed during the Abbasid era, which erupted in the 3rd century AH (9th century CE) in the region of Basra in southern Iraq. This rebellion was led by a man who claimed descent from the Prophet&#8217;s family, known as\u00a0<strong>Ali ibn Muhammad<\/strong>, also referred to as the\u00a0<strong>Leader of the Zanj<\/strong>. He exploited the difficult social and economic conditions faced by slaves and impoverished peasants in the region, inciting them to revolt against the Abbasid authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes of the Zanj Rebellion:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Social and Economic Injustice<\/strong>: Slaves, particularly those of African origin (Zanj), suffered from severe exploitation in agricultural work and land reclamation, especially in the marshlands of southern Iraq. They lived in harsh conditions, making them susceptible to incitement for rebellion.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claim of being a descendant of Ali<\/strong>: Ali ibn Muhammad claimed to be a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib, leveraging this claim to attract supporters from Shiites and Alawis who were facing persecution under the Abbasid Caliphate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heresy and Incitement<\/strong>: Ali ibn Muhammad (The individual who started the rebellion) was eloquent and cunning in his speeches, using these skills to incite slaves and peasants to revolt, promising them freedom and justice.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Events of the Rebellion:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The rebellion began in\u00a0<strong>255 AH (869 CE)<\/strong>, where Ali ibn Muhammad managed to gather a large number of slaves and peasants, forming a strong army.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Zanj succeeded in controlling large parts of Basra and its surrounding areas, committing massacres and atrocities against the population.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rebellion lasted for\u00a0<strong>13 years<\/strong>, during which the Zanj defeated several armies sent by the Abbasid Caliph to suppress them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ultimately, the Abbasid commander\u00a0<strong>Abu Ahmad al-Muwaffaq Talha<\/strong>, the brother of Caliph\u00a0<strong>al-Mu&#8217;tamid ala Allah<\/strong>, organized a large military campaign and succeeded in defeating the Zanj, killing their leader Ali ibn Muhammad in\u00a0<strong>270 AH (883 CE)<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outcomes of the Rebellion:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Zanj Rebellion was one of the most dangerous uprisings faced by the Abbasid Caliphate, causing significant destruction in Basra and its surrounding regions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rebellion weakened the Abbasid Caliphate economically and militarily, contributing to the fragmentation of central authority.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rebellion also served as an example of how social and economic unrest could be exploited to achieve political goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Historians&#8217; Accounts:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historians such as\u00a0<strong>al-Tabari<\/strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Ibn al-Atheer<\/strong>\u00a0detailed this rebellion, describing the atrocities committed by the Zanj and the role of Ali ibn Muhammad in inciting them.
