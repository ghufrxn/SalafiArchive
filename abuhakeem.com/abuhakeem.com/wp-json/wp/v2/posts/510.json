They would gather the asaaneed (chains of narration for one hadeeth) and study the various versions of the hadeeth and the connection between the chains of narration, with a view to analysing errors of the various versions.<\/p>\n<p>From their methodology in hadeeth is that they would memorise ahaadeeth that they knew to be weak for the purposes of &#8216;i&#8217;tibaar&#8217; (that is for the purpose of comparing those narrations with other than them, and also if the hadeeth is weak but they come across other chains of transmission then those weak narrations may be strengthened by way of those chains (as long as the weakness is not severe).<\/p>\n<p>One reason they would memorise weak Ahaadeeth is &#8216;lil ma&#8217;rifati&#8217; (that is to become aquainted with them)<\/p>\n<p>Imaam Khateebul Baghdaadi mentions in Al Jaami&#8217; li akhlaaqir Raawi wa adaabis saami&#8217; 2\/192:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As for the ahaadeeth of weak narrators and those who we do not rely upon their narrations, then they are written down that one may be acquainted with them and so that they will not be exchanged with (and be confused by) the ahaadeeth of the trustworthy narrators and that one may compare and judge them with the narrations of others.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Al Imaam Ibn Rajab mentions in his explanation of &#8216;Illal At Tirmidhi (1\/130 Noorudeen &#8216;itr Print) a narration of Muhammad Ibn Raafi&#8217; An Naisaaboori who said:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I saw Ahmad (the Imaam) in front of yazeed Ibn Haroon and in his hand was a book of Zuhair narrating from Jaabir Al Ju&#8217;fee (a well known weak narrator) and he was copying it so i said: &#8220;<em>Oh Abaa Abdillah! you have prohibited us from narrating from Jaabir yet you write his ahaadeeth<\/em>?! so he responded: &#8220;<em>I know him<\/em>!&#8221; (That is i am awre of his state)<\/p>\n<p>Similarly he said about the weak narrator Ubaidillah Al Wasaafi: &#8220;<em>Indeed I write his hadeeth to be acquainted with them<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thus in an attempt to follow the path of ahlul hadeeth in that regard I start this series of popular ahaadeeth da&#8217;eefah lil ma&#8217;rifah.
