The festival, which celebrated the coming of\u00a0spring, included fertility rites and the pairing off of women with men by lottery. As a fertility rite, the festival is also associated with the god\u00a0Faunus. Faunus was originally worshipped throughout the countryside as a bestower of fruitfulness on fields and flocks. He eventually became primarily a woodland deity; the sounds of the forest being regarded as his voice. A grandson of\u00a0Saturn, Faunus was typically represented as half man, half goat. Lupercalia was a celebration of fertility held partly in his honour each February. From February 13th to 15th, Youths clothed as goats ran through the streets wielding strips of goatskin. The men sacrificed a goat and a dog, then whipped women with the hides of the animals they had just slain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would drink and get drunk. Young women would line up for the men to hit them, they believed this would make them fertile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the 5th century, Pope\u00a0Gelasius I\u00a0forbid the celebration of Lupercalia and is sometimes attributed with replacing it with St. Valentine\u2019s Day, Valentine\u2019s Day did not come to be celebrated as a day of romance until about the 14th century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How the 14<sup>th<\/sup> of Feb adopted the name Valentines Day<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the name \u2018Valentines Day\u2019, then it comes from a Christian priest who was martyred. There was more than one Christian priest that were killed named Valentine. Thus, but it is claimed that day may have taken its name from the Valentine that was killed\u00a0about 270CE\u00a0by emperor Claudius II Gothicus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emperor Claudius II executed two men \u2014 both named Valentine \u2014 on February 14<sup>th<\/sup> of different years in the third century. Their martyrdom was honoured by the Catholic Church with the celebration of St. Valentine&#8217;s Day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is said that one of the Valentines may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons, where they were often beaten and tortured. Some hold that&nbsp;St Valentines&nbsp;defied the emperor\u2019s orders and secretly married couples to spare the husbands from war. It is for this reason that the day&nbsp;is associated with love. The imprisoned Valentine is said to have sent the first \u201cvalentine\u201d greeting himself after he fell in love with a young girl\u2014apparently his jailor\u2019s daughter\u2014who visited him during his confinement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter signed \u201cFrom your Valentine,\u201d an expression that is still in use today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, this pagan festivity was merged with the honouring of this \u2018martyred\u2019 priest and Valentines Day was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Muslim celebrates love every day. The love of Allah, the love of his parents, the love of one\u2019s wife or husband, the love of one\u2019s children, the love of one\u2019s siblings, the love of ones Muslims brothers or sisters. Why would we need to partake in a pagan\/Christian festivity to do so?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Valentines day has origins in the Roman pagan festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February.
