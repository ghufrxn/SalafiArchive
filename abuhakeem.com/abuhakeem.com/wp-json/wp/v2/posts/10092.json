He would fast continuously and complete the recitation of the Quran every night.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say (Imaam Ad Dhahabi): This is a form of worship that inspires humility, but for someone like Wakee&#8217;, an Imam from the Athari scholars (Scholars of the narrations), it is considered less preferable. It is authentically established that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited fasting continuously and also forbade completing the Quran in less than three days. Religion is meant to be easy, and following the Sunnah is paramount. May Allah be pleased with Wakee&#8217;, and where is the like of Wakee&#8217;? Despite this, he was known to regularly drink the Nabidh of Kufa, which could intoxicate if consumed excessively. He interpreted its permissibility, but had he avoided it out of caution, it would have been more appropriate. For whoever avoids doubtful matters safeguards their religion and honour. The prohibition of the mentioned Nabidh is well-established, but this is not the place to delve into such details. Everyone&#8217;s statements are subject to acceptance or rejection, and no one is to be followed in their mistakes. Indeed, a scholar should not be reproached for what they do based on their own reasoning (ijtihad). We ask Allah for His forgiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Siyar A&#8217;laam An Nubalaa: 9\/140))<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This highlights that even great scholars are not infallible, and their actions based on personal reasoning (ijtihad) should not be blindly followed if they contradict the established Sunnah. But Indeed the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Diligence of Scholars Wakee&#8217; ibn al-Jarrah ibn Malih, the Imam, the Preserver of Hadith, the Scholar of Iraq, Abu Sufyan, one of the eminent figures.
