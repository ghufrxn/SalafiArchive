Then they do not persist upon that which they did after they know\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And from the things the Muslim should strive and hasten towards<\/p>\n<p>Thus this character of theirs \u201cThose who give in good time and during times of difficulty\u201d this description indicate the fact they are people of noble lofty character.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed the messenger was the most generous of the people and he was most generous in Ramadhan<\/p>\n<p>The opposite of generosity is miserliness and is from the ugliest of characters and we seek Allahs refuge from it<\/p>\n<p>Then he mentioned the statement of Allah:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c..those who suppress anger and those who pardon the people\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He followed the verse with the hadeeth\u00a0\u201cwhosoever suppresses anger while he has the ability to act upon it Allah will call him in front of all of the people (on the day of judgement) that he may choose from whichever of the houril Ain he pleases\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thus this affair of suppressing anger and pardoning people is not from humiliation rather it is from nobility<\/p>\n<p>He also mentioned the hadeeth \u201cA servant does not increase through pardoning the people except in nobility and whoever humbles himself for Allah, Allah raises him\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thus to pardon the one who oppresses of harms you is not humiliation or belittlement rather it is honour<\/p>\n<p>The sheikh then made dua for himself and all present and opened the floor for questions.<\/p>\n<p>The questions were read to him by sheikh Abu Abdil\u00a0A\u2019laa, though the questions were mainly around Hajj there was one question that was relevant and that the questioner asked saying I am an Algerian who has taken up residence in the UK and I married a European woman.\u00a0 She had embraced Islam then after a period she apostate and has gone with my children and I am unable to get my children from her what is your advice?<\/p>\n<p>The sheikh responded by saying this is a punishment and recompense to you from Allah for taking up residence in the lands of shirk! Then he mentioned advice to the questioner and all who have taken up residence in the lands of the kufaar\u00a0for the purpose of obtaining the dunya\u00a0is to return to their Muslim lands. For indeed the affair is very dangerous\u00a0and we have seen may of their offsprings apostate from Islam. Those who migrate to those lands it is a must that apostacy will overcome them or some of their offsprings, and this is an affair that is known and observed . \u00a0So seek your sustenance from Allah For Allah Says: \u201cIndeed Allah is The Sustainer, the possessor of great might\u201d know that what Allah has written for you from provisions will never pass you. So we believe that Allah he is the provider and that what is written in the preserved tablet will not change, neither will our provisions pass us. And it is possible that one may live in the lands of the disbeliever poor and disgraced, doing menial labour such as toilet cleaning and the like! Indeed the Muslim is noble and honourable.<\/p>\n<p>Allah says: \u201cBut Honour power and glory belong to Allah, His messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites know not\u201d (Suratul Munaafiqqoon Vs 8)<\/p>\n<p>Thus the believer should be noble, have richness in his heart and live in his own land the lands of Islaam, where he can nurture his children upon the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the messenger of Allah \u2013 Sallallahu alaihi\u00a0wa salam<\/p>\n<p>He mentioned that we are truly sorry to hear about your children and that you should try what you can to get them back into your custody<\/p>\n<p>Those were some brief note on yesterdays sitting and I will endeavour to summarise\u00a0todays sitting tomorrow inshallah<\/p>\n<p>Wallahu A\u2019lam<\/p>\n<p>www.twitter.com\/abuhakeembilal<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bismillahi\u00a0Wal Hamdullillah\u00a0Was Salaatu\u00a0Was Salaamu\u00a0&#8216;Alaa\u00a0Rasoolillahi Amaa\u00a0Ba&#8217;d: The following is a summary and\u00a0some\u00a0benefits from our sitting with Shaikh Rabee\u00a0ibnu\u00a0Haadi\u00a0Al Madkhali\u00a0&#8211; Hafidhahullah In yesterdays (1\/11\/2012) sitting our sheikh \u00a0spoke about the importance of tawheed and how the prophets and Messengers all strove to establish it.
