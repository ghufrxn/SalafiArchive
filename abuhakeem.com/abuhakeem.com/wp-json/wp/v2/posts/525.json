Consider the following hadeeth:<\/p>\n<p>Upon the authority of Dahaak ibn Sufyaan &#8211; Radhiyallahu Anhu &#8211; who said that the messenger of Allah &#8211; Sallallahu Alaihi wa Salam &#8211; said to him:&#8221; Oh <strong><em>Dahhaak!

They responded &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said: &#8220;<strong><em>And do you have drink<\/em><\/strong>?&#8221; They replied &#8216;Yes!&#8217; then he said: &#8220;<strong><em>And you choose and select it<\/em><\/strong> (ie your food)? They said : &#8216;Yes!&#8217; he said: &#8220;<strong><em>And you cool it<\/em><\/strong> (i.e. your drink) they said Yes!

By Allah\u00a0I do not fear for you Oh people except that which Allah brings forth for you from the glitter of the dunya<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; So a man said: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allah! Does good bring about evil? So the Messenger of Allah remained silent for a period then he said: &#8220;<strong><em>What did you say<\/em><\/strong>?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;Does good bring about evil? So the Messenger of Allah &#8211; Sallallahu alaihi was Salam said: &#8220;<strong><em>Indeed good does not bring about except good, but is it good<\/em><\/strong>? (Then he continued): &#8220;<strong><em>Every time the spring brings forth vegetation, there are livestock that die from it due to excessive over consumption or come near to death. Except for the one that eats greenery until its stomach is full, then it lies on its side looking at the sun, it defecates, urinates, regurgitates its food and continues chewing. Thus whosoever consumes wealth with its due right, then Allah will place blessings therein.
