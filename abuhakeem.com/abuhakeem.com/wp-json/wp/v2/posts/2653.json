It seeks is to destroy the status of the people of knowledge, their statements and their guidance. This doubt has been used throughout time to cunningly belittle the people of knowledge in the mind of the unsuspecting innocent layperson, and to replace the people of knowledge with these individuals, who present themselves as people skilled in the knowledge of understanding strong or weak evidences. Thus reliance falls upon them.<\/p>\n<p>By way of this statement of theirs, the statements of the people of knowledge have little worth, rather true worth is in the hands of this individual who will dictate who and what is to be taken from and who and what is to be rejected. This is particularly when it come to the affair of their statements against the people of deviation. As though the people of knowledge do not speak from a standpoint of taqwa and fear of Allah, but desire. As if the people of knowledge are fickle individuals who speak against people upon a whim. The Salaf of this Ummah would <em><strong>truly<\/strong><\/em> value the statements of the people of knowledge.

But they are used by these individuals, to put doubt upon the statements, verdicts and advises of the Scholars, because when the scholars speak against someone and warns, often times the general person may not be acquainted with the reasons for the warning, and may not even understand the gravity of the issue, even if it were explained to them!<\/p>\n<p>As <em><u>Al Hasan Al Basri<\/u><\/em> mentioned:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>The fitna, when it appears, it is known by the Ulam\u0101, and when its tail end appears (i.e. when it is over) it is known by every general person<\/em><\/strong>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That is to say when fitna arises it is spotted, detected and understood by the people of knowledge, how will the ignorant one perceive it, if it is intricate?<\/p>\n<p>Based upon the statements of these ignoramuses, we should leave the general people to get engrossed in these issues, relying upon their own weak deficient understanding, possibly becoming unsatisfied with the evidence presented by those scholars, (since he (the layman) may be ignorant of the foundation that has been opposed) and thus go astray!<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge of the men is in the hands of the people of Knowledge!<\/p>\n<h2><u>The Methodology of Criticism with the Salaf<\/u><\/h2>\n<p>It is established with the people of Sunnah and Had\u012bth, that the people of knowledge have a methodology related to criticism well known.

None of that which we hear from the ignorant ones, about the \u2018correct\u2019 salafi position&#8217; concerning deviant individuals, takes this science into consideration.
