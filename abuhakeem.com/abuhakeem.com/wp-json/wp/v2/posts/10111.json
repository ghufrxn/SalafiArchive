They ran a shop in Kufa selling fabrics and other goods, as was common among many early scholars who relied on their own earnings for sustenance (10\/142).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmad ibn Mansur al-Ramadi said: &#8220;I went out with Ahmad (ibn Hanbal) and Yahya (ibn Ma&#8217;in) to Abd al-Razzaq as their servant. When we returned to Kufa, Yahya ibn Ma&#8217;in said, &#8216;I want to test Abu Nu&#8217;aym.&#8217; Ahmad said, &#8216;Do not do so; the man is trustworthy.&#8217; Yahya replied, &#8216;I must.&#8217; He took a piece of paper and wrote thirty hadiths, placing at the head of every ten a hadith that was not from Abu Nu&#8217;aym&#8217;s narrations. They then went to Abu Nu&#8217;aym, who came out and sat on a clay bench. Ahmad ibn Hanbal sat him on his right, Yahya on his left, and I sat below the bench.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yahya took out the paper and read ten hadiths to him. When he reached the eleventh, Abu Nu&#8217;aym said, &#8216;This is not from my narrations; strike it out.&#8217; He then read the second set of ten, and Abu Nu&#8217;aym remained silent until the second hadith, when he said, &#8216;This is not from my narrations; strike it out.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he read the third set and reached the third hadith, Abu Nu&#8217;aym&#8217;s expression changed, and his eyes turned red. He turned to Yahya and said, &#8216;As for this one (pointing to Ahmad), his piety is too great to do such a thing. As for this one (pointing to me), I am too insignificant for him to do this to. But this is your doing, O wrongdoer!&#8217; He then kicked Yahya with his foot, throwing him off the bench, stood up, and went inside his house. Ahmad ibn Hanbal said to Yahya, &#8216;Did I not warn you and tell you that he is reliable?&#8217; Yahya replied, &#8216;By Allah, his kick is more beloved to me than this entire journey.'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From al-Husayn ibn Amr al-Anqazi, who said: &#8220;A man knocked on Abu Nu&#8217;aym&#8217;s door. Abu Nu&#8217;aym asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;It is me.&#8217; Abu Nu&#8217;aym asked, &#8216;Who is &#8220;me&#8221;?&#8217; The man said, &#8216;A man from the children of Adam.&#8217; Abu Nu&#8217;aym came out, kissed him, and said, &#8216;Welcome! I did not think anyone from this lineage remained.'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abu Nu&#8217;aym said: &#8220;I often marvel at Aisha&#8217;s statement, &#8216;Those who provided for us have passed away.&#8217; But I say:<br>&#8216;<em>The people have gone, leaving us behind,<br>Among the worst of humankind.<br>We count them as part of our number,<br>But when examined, they are not people.<br>Whenever I seek something from them,<br>They preempt me with despair before I even ask.<br>They weep for me until I wish<br>I could escape from them unscathed<\/em>.'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Siyarul A&#8217;laamin Nubalaa: 10\/142)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Trustworthiness of Abu Nu&#8217;aym al-Fadl ibn Dukayn Abu Nu&#8217;aym al-Fadl ibn Dukayn, the great Hafiz and Shaykh of Islam, was a partner of Abd al-Salam ibn Harb al-Malaa&#8217;i.
