This is a position that was held by some of the scholars of hadeeth, since Imaam Ibn Khuzaima, who was followed by imam Ibn Hibbaan then Imaam Al Muhib At Tabari (all) placed as a chapter heading upon this hadeeth &#8216;The removal of Hayaa &#8216;alas Salaah on a rainy day&#8217;. This is that which the hadeeth would necessitate, if only the narrations being raised and attributed to the messenger (himself) was apparent. If that was established then the mu&#8217;adhin would have the choice between removing it, due to this hadeeth or leaving it, due to the other ahaadeeth and Allah Knows best.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>6. <strong>The Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah<\/strong> that states:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>The Messenger of Allah &#8211; Sallallahu Alaihi was Salam used to, if it was a cold or rainy night, command his mu&#8217;adhin to call the first Adhaan then when he was finished he would call <strong>&#8216;As Salaatu Fir Rihaal&#8217;<\/strong> or &#8216;<strong>Fee Rihaalikum<\/strong><\/em><strong>&#8216;<\/strong>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Collected by Abu Ahmad Ibn Adi as was mentioned in &#8216;Tarhu Tathreeb fee sharhit Taqreeb&#8217; of Al Haafidh Al Iraaqi 1\/319 but he did not mention anything about its chain of narration)<\/p>\n<p>From these ahaadeeth and this discussion of the Shaikh we conclude the following:<\/p>\n<p>1. That due to the principle in the shar&#8217;iah of the alleviation of harm we have this ruling that establishes ease for the believers.<\/p>\n<p>2. That the announcement is made during cold, difficult and\/or rainy weather<\/p>\n<p>3.

That the call is made either after the statement &#8216;Hayaa &#8216;alal falaah&#8217; or it is made at the end of the adhaan<\/p>\n<p>5. That to remove the hay&#8217;alatain (I.e Hayaa &#8216;alas Salaah and Hayaa alal Falaah) and to replace them with this announcement, though it was held permissible by some of the scholars of hadeeth, it is not present in a narration attributed to the Messenger of Allah &#8211; Sallallahu alaihi was Salam. Those who hold the position argue that the two terms are opposed to each other, so they hold that by virtue of the meaning of the wording, the call to come to salaah should be removed. The command to do so is authentically attributed to Ibn Abbaas &#8211; Radhiyallahu Anhumaa<\/p>\n<p>6.
