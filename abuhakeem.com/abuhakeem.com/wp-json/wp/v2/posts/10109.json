Conversely, those who are stern and reserved should strive to smile, improve their character, and reproach themselves for their poor manners. Any deviation from moderation is blameworthy, and the soul must be disciplined and trained. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Siyarul A&#8217;laamin Nubalaa: 10\/140)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Types of Laughter Muhammad ibn al-Nu&#8217;man ibn Abd al-Salam said: &#8220;I have never seen anyone more devout than Yahya ibn Hammad, and I think he never laughed.&#8221; I say: Smiling and light laughter are preferable.
