His claim that the Messenger erred in regards to the means of giving da\u2019wah (Wasaa&#8217;ilud Da&#8217;wah)<\/p>\n<p>2. His belief that not all of the sunnah is revelation<\/p>\n<p>3. His establishing that the statements of the Messenger \u2013 Sallallahu \u2018Alaihi was Salam are not accepted except with evidence<\/p>\n<p>4. His belittling some of the affairs of the religion that we have been commanded with (like his statement about Shaikh Muhammad Al Imaam, who gave a lecture during the period of the attack of the Hoothi shi&#8217;ites upon Ahlus Sunnah and he mentioned &#8220;Ahlus Sunnah will die from hunger and Killing and this one doesn&#8217;t even mention it! instead he speaks of the Hijaab and whether a woman should cover or not!&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>5. His holding that some of the people of hypocrisy (Munaafiqoon) were students of the Messenger \u2013 Sallallahu \u2018alaihi was Salam<\/p>\n<p>6. His claim that the deviation known as \u2018Irjaa\u2019 (the belief that imaan is in the heart alone (or the heart and tongue as some used to hold) and it doesn\u2019t rise and fall, and that actions are not from Imaan) started with the Sahaabah and that the first the speak with it was Qudaama Ibn Madh\u2019oon \u2013 Radhiyallahu \u2018Anhu<\/p>\n<p>7. His attack upon the rightly guided Khalifah Uthmaan \u2013 Radhiyallahu \u2018Anhu<\/p>\n<p>8. His claim that The Companions at the battle of Badr disobeyed Allah twice and so Allah made a calamity overcome them (this he claims, is the meaning of the verse 165 in Suratu Aali Imraam (&#8220;you smote your enemies with one (i.e a disaster) twice as great&#8221;..(Refering to their victory in the Battle of Badr) he claims the verse means they commited two sins in the battle of Badr!<\/p>\n<p>9. His method of enumerating the errors of the companions similar to the raafidhah<\/p>\n<p>10. His view that the Sahaabah participated in the killing Uthmaan<\/p>\n<p>11. His view that whosoever curses all of the companions, then he doesn\u2019t disbelieve until he intends by way of that to reject the whole religion or to disparage it<\/p>\n<p>12. His claim that the companions forsook uthmaan \u2013 Radhiyallahu \u2018Anhum<\/p>\n<p>13. His claim that if Allah punished all of his slaves without them having sinned or committed a crime, then he wouldn\u2019t have oppressed them, which is the belief of the Jahmiyah and the Ash\u2019arees (The belief of Ahlus Sunnah is that Allah would never do such a thing rather he only punishes due to actions committed and Ahlus Sunnah do not even make the suggestion since it opposses the attribute of Justice) &#8211; A note on point 13<\/p>\n<p>14. His claim that whosoever doesn\u2019t know the truth (I.e From the people of knowledge) after researching, then that is due to his negligence, for if he had researched correctly then he would have found it. This is the belief of the Qadariyah and the Mu\u2019tazilah. Ahlus Sunnah Hold that the Mujtahid who strives to come to the truth and exerts all his efforts doing so then he is rewarded for his efforts and is not punished or considered negligent<\/p>\n<p>15. His claim that Pharoah and the Kuffaar called to Tawheed Ar Ruboobiyah<\/p>\n<p>16. His view that Ahlus Sunnah is the &#8216;closest&#8217; of the groups to the truth<\/p>\n<p>17. His claim that there is no difference between innovators who call to their innovation and those who do not call and thus he claims that the speech of the Salaf in that regard is false empty speech<\/p>\n<p>18. His declaring someone an innovator due to sin (like him declaring on the tape &#8216;Tubayin Al Kadhib&#8217; when asked about a man that leads people in Salaah but he is homosexual he responded &#8216;A homosexual is not from Ahlus Sunnah!&#8217; what is a Sunni?! Is he merely the one who affirm the names and attributes?!)<\/p>\n<p>19. Him not making a difference between At-Tawwali (To show love and alliegence to the Kuffaar, and to love to see them and their religion aided and victorious over the Muslims) and Al Muwaalaat (as for Muwaalaat, then it resembles At Tawali in the affair of aiding and supporting but on occasions it is done for reasons related to deen and on occasions it is done for worldly purposes which is a sin but not considered Kufr)<\/p>\n<p>20. He declares the son of Adam Qaabil (Kane) a Kaafir! And he passes the verdict of apostasy upon him! (Shaikh Ibn Baaz Mentions in Majmoo&#8217; Al Fataawaa (3\/117): &#8220;Indeed Qaabil (Kane) was sinful and killed his brother Haabil (Abel) without right but they were both upon Islaam!&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>21. <strong>Him holding assassination of foreigners permissible<\/strong> (In the tape \u2018As\u2019ilatu Ashaab Hais\u2019 he was asked about a Christian woman living in a region known as Abs who was teaching women to play football in a specific place so he responded by saying \u201c<em>Allahul Musta\u2019aan wallahi this is fitna! The call to Christianity is fitna! I ask Allah to make it easy for someone to assassinate her! Yes True! I ask Allah to make it easy for someone to Assassinate her<\/em>!&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>22. From the evidence of his weakness in Aqeedah:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 His statement in Al Mabaadee Al Mufeedah (a book he authored wherein he poses questions related to aqeedah then he answers them himself) p 25: Q: What do you believe concerning the Qur\u2019aan that is in the Mushaf? Then say: \u201c I believe It is the book of Allah \u2013 Azza Wa Jal \u2013 and it isn\u2019t created\u201d End quote.<\/p>\n<p>Ahlus Sunnah do not restrict their belief in the Qur\u2019aan being the speech of Allah to that which is in the Mushaf alone, whether it is in the Mushaf, recited, listened to or written. We do not restrict it to that which is in the Mushaf alone as Al Hajoori does here. Which is an issue that could easily be misunderstood by the beginner, the like of whom this book was written for.<\/p>\n<p>23. His affirmation of the statement of Al Busairi: \u2018Oh most Noble of creation I have none that I resort to other than you! When comes the appearance of general calamities\u2026\u201d He responded by saying \u201c \u2018<em>Oh most noble of creation\u2019 <strong>This is correct<\/strong><\/em>!..There is no doubt that the Messenger IS the Most Noble of creation but when this statement is connected to the statement of shirk that follows it is not correct.<\/p>\n<p>24. Him holding onto the deviated principle of Abul Hasan that: \u201c<strong>General speech should he held in the light of that which is specific<\/strong>\u201d He mentions in Al Kanzuth Thameen (4\/461): \u201c<em> If the origin with that scholar is (that he is upon) the Sunnah and (known for) defending it, but there came from him some statements in some places (i.e. in his speech or books) that opposes what he believes, then this statement of his that opposes the correct clear believe of his is understood in the light of his correct belief<\/em>..\u201d this is a false principle, rather the correct position is that the one who errs in statement or action then it is said to him you have made a mistake even if he is from Ahlus Sunnah and we do not view his incorrect statement in the light of that which we know from his correct belief.<\/p>\n<p>25. Instances of him opposing the Qur\u2019aan:<\/p>\n<p>From the statements that have come from him in opposition to the Qur\u2019aan:<\/p>\n<p>He mentions in \u2018Al Arba\u2019een Al Hisaan li tanbeeh al Anaam ilaa fadhlil Ijtimaa\u2019 \u2018alat Ta\u2019aam\u2019 P6: \u201c<em>Indeed while upon a journey I undertook to Britain for da\u2019wah, I met some callers who I consider people of Sunnah and Itibaa\u2019 and we had gather for Dinner. The host then began presenting each person with individual plates as is the culture of the Kufaar over there, a man and his household and his guests all eat separately, they gather around the food individually, each person sitting away from the other not calling anyone else to participate with him. This is a blameworthy custom, and evil western cultural practice<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here he describes it as being:<br \/>\n1. From the culture of the Kufaar<br \/>\n2. Blameworthy and evil cultural practice<br \/>\n3. He speaks ill of it<\/p>\n<p>And this is in opposition to the Qur\u2019aan. Allah the most high says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no sin upon you whether you eat together or apart\u201d (Suratun Nur Vs 61)<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer mentions concerning the verse:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>In this is an allowance from Allah for a man to eat by himself or with a group even though eating together is better and more blessed<\/em>\u201d (Tafseer Ibn Katheer 6\/86)<\/p>\n<p>Shaikh Abdur Rahmaan Ibn Naasir As Sa\u2019dee mentions:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>All of this is permissible, that the people of a household eat together or that each individual eats by himself, and in this is removal of harm<\/em>..\u201d (Tafseer Sa\u2019dee P575)<\/p>\n<p>(Note: The reference here is to a gathering with Shaikh Abdur Razaaq Ibn Abdul Muhsin Al Abaad, I had accompanied Al Hajoori to the dinner so I remember it well, since his manner of correcting what he &#8216;thought&#8217; was evil was terrible and in all honesty extremely embarrassing!)<\/p>\n<p>26. From the statements that have come from him in opposition to the Qur\u2019aan:<\/p>\n<p>He mentions in the tape: \u201ctahdheeru Ahlil Yemen\u201d \u2013 \u201c<em>Indeed the people of Saalih, when they were <strong>ALL UNITED <\/strong>upon rejecting him, Allah destroyed them ALL<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is in opposition to that which is in the Qur\u2019aan:<\/p>\n<p>Allah the the most high says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>Indeed we sent to Thamood their brother Saalih saying \u2018Worship Allah! Then Lo! They became two parties (believers and disbelievers) quarrelling with each other<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratun Naml Vs 45)<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer mentions in his Tafseer (10 \/414):<\/p>\n<p>\u201c..Mujaahid said (about the verse) \u201c<em>Believer and disbeliever<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Allah the most high likewise mentions:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>So when our command came we saved Saalih and those who were with him by a mercy from us and from the disgrace of that day. Verily your lord he is the All strong the All mighty. And the Awful Cry of punishment overtook the wrongdoers, so they lay dead prostrate in their homes<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratul Hood Vs 66-67)<\/p>\n<p>27. Al Hajoori mentions in the tape: An Nahy \u2018Anil Fasaad: \u201c<em>It is not befitting that we are heedless about any affair from the affairs of the deen regardless of how the people consider it from the simple affairs, or regardless of whether it is as a simple affair in their view. For indeed Allah destroyed a nation from the nations due to weights and measures and them slighting people in regards to weights and measures. A(nother) nation Allah destroyed due to homosexuality and a nation Allah destroyed due to a She-Camel<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This statement is in opposition to that which is clear in the Qur\u2019aan since Allah mentions:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em><strong>The Ashaabul Ayka rejected the Messengers<\/strong><\/em>\u201d (Suratush Shu\u2019araa Vs 176)<\/p>\n<p>And Allah says: \u201c<strong><em>The people of Loot rejected the Messengers<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratush Shu\u2019araa Vs 160)<\/p>\n<p>And Allah says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>The people of Thamood rejected the Messengers<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratush Shu\u2019araa vs 141)<\/p>\n<p>These then, were not the main reasons for their destruction, rather their committing shirk, Kufr and rejection of the Messengers.<\/p>\n<p>28. Al Hajoori mentions in the tape \u2018Meeraathul Anbiyaa\u2019 The Messenger inherited from those who came before him and Abu Bakr and Umar inherited from the Messenger \u2013 Sallallahu alaihi Was salam\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Allah the most high says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>Neither did you (Oh Muhammad ) read any book before it (the Qur\u2019aan) nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand. In that case the followers of falsehood might have doubted<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Suratul Ankaboot Vs 48)<\/p>\n<p>29. His applying verses concerning killing and waging war against Allah and his messenger upon one who commits Gheebah (backbiting) and Nameemah (Talecarrying):<\/p>\n<p>He mentions in his lecture &#8216;An Nahyu &#8216;Anil Fasaad&#8217; (The Prohibition against causing corruption):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes Indeed the one who traverses through the earth causing corruption between the people, with any type of corruption of Fasaad then it is as though he has killed them! Allah, The Might and Majestic has informed us of this in the story of Bani Israa&#8217;eel and concerning their affair He says:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of that We ordained for the children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) due to spreading mischief in the land, then it would be as if he had killed all mankind. and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of all of Mankind..&#8221;(Suratul Maa&#8217;idah Vs 32) (He continues) for this reason Allah multiplied the punishment upon those who cause corruption upon the earth.<\/p>\n<p>(Allah says):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and his Messenger and do mischief in the land is that they shall be killed or crucified of their hands and their feet cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world and a great torment is theirs in the hereafter&#8221; (Suratul Maa&#8217;idah Vs 33) then he continues: &#8220;..Yes! for them is disgrace in the life of this world, for indeed there is nothing more disgraceful than one who traverses among people backbiting and spreading false tales. Backbiting, Talecarrying and lieing! Gathering between various types of sin in the same instance! there is nothing more disgraceful than these types (of individuals)!<\/p>\n<p>While the great Imaam of tafseer Ibn Jareer At Tabari has mentioned in his tafseer (10\/321-323):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;.. The meaning of this statement then is due to the transgression of the son of adam (Kane) who killed his brother (Abel), we passed a verdict upon the Children of Israel, that whosoever kills a soul oppresively, without another soul being killed, then he will be killed in retribution due to that. (As for the statement of Allah) &#8220;Or due to (it) spreading mischief in the land&#8221; ..that is whosoever kills a soul without that soul having caused corruption in the earth thus warranting that it be killed due to that. A soul causes corruption in the earth by waging war against Allah and his Messenger and causing fear to be struck upon the pathways (i.e stripping them of safety and security). And that which we have mentioned here concerning this is what scholars of interpetation of the Qur&#8217;aan say&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thus the only thing the verse indicates is that a life may be taken (as dictacted by the laws of corporal punishment administered by the governor of an Islamic State), if that individual had murdered or caused corruption in the earth. It does not indicate that one who causes fitna due to backbiting and talecarrying then his action is as enormous as or like unto taking a life!<\/p>\n<p>30. He says in a lecture entitled: &#8216;Naseehatun lil Jawaasees Was Sahafiyeen&#8217; &#8220;The one who killed the She-Camel (of Saalih &#8211; alahis Salaam) was one person, THE REST OF THEM WERE ALL SILENT, however they were pleased with his action..&#8221; End quote<\/p>\n<p>Allah &#8211; Jalla Jalaalahu said: &#8220;But they called their comrade and he took a knife and he killed her&#8221; (Suratul Qamar Vs 29)<\/p>\n<p>Imaamut Tabari mentions in his tafseer (22\/593):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The (correct) interpretation concerning the statement of the most high: &#8220;..But they called their comrade..&#8221; is that he, the most high, mentions that Thamood called their companion, the one who killed the She-Camel, Qidaar Ibn Saalif, to kill the She-Camel WHILE THEY ALL ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO. the statement:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;..and he took a knife and he killed her&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He mention that he took the camel with his hands and killed her..&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>31.His statement concerning female soldiers He says in \u2018Hasdul Adillah\u2019 P75<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the jealousy of the guardians of these women is, or maybe they are just a bunch of abandoned children, women who are the result of free mixing in universities, thus the fruit of this is what is indicated by the statement of the messenger &#8211; Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Was Salam \u2013 \u201cThe child of fornication is the worst of the three\u201d \u2026 he goes on to mention on page 79<br \/>\n\u201c<strong>and it is known that if a woman becomes a soldier then what stems from that is that she will be alone with soldiers because it is a must that she obeys her superior \u2026and perhaps he will command her to lay down and sprawl out on the floor and crawl upon her hands and knees, and he may strip her of her clothes and she may have to shower with cold water on a cold night<\/strong>\u2026so what do you think the outcome will be Oh guardian with this miskeenah! \u2026<strong>what is to be expected of you daughter or your sister with this &#8216;absolute obedience&#8217;?? He may even lock her in a concealed room\u2026so what do you expect Oh Pimp! When your daughter has to go out to carry out her &#8216;duties&#8217; with the auxiliaries<\/strong>! Or other than her, with that man who would have likely followed her around on the streets much less have his hunted game come to him in his pen, this would be considered easy prey! So what do you expect Oh pimp!\u201c<\/p>\n<p>32.He mentions in the lecture \u2018Asillatu Ahli Yareem when he was asked about working in The Office of criminal research in the investigations department:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>For you to come out of a sewer of urine and faeces is lighter than for you to come out of this department! To be soiled in urine and faeces from you head to your toes is lighter than to be soiled by this lowly despicable job<\/strong>! Investigators are from the greatest liars among the people! For that reason many in authority do not trust these investigators! It turns people into spies! Spies who have spies over them! And over those spies are spies! Because they all know they are liars!.. The spy comes to every person in their form! He comes for example to the one who sell tomatoes in the form of a tomato seller and to the one who sell potatoes in the form of a potato seller and among the student of knowledge as a student of knowledge, <strong>and among homosexuals as an effeminate Gay! Wallahi to this level! And in order to be a spy he must let them do what they wish to him! So that he may report that people are carrying out Homosexual acts<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>Is this the speech of the Aalim?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Examples of his lies<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Shaikh Ubaid\u00a0Al Jaabiri<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>He claims in the lecture \u2018Asilatu Ashaabul Luhaj\u2019<\/p>\n<p>33. \u201c<strong>He (Shaikh Ubaid) sees that Abul Hasan is not an innovator<\/strong>\u201d !!<\/p>\n<p>Shaikh Ubaid mentions in The lecture \u2018Maraahilunaa ma\u2019 Abil Hasan\u2019: \u201c<em>Indeed the man is not from Ahlus\u00a0Sunnah in his manhaj\u00a0His Manhaj\u00a0is corrupt, that which I am certain of is that he is a pure Ikhwaani, plotter who plays games a plant amongst the scholars of Ahlus Sunnah and the students of knowledge in Yemen in order to split their ranks and to make them groups and parties<\/em>!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>34. \u201c<strong>He sees that Qutb is not an innovator!
