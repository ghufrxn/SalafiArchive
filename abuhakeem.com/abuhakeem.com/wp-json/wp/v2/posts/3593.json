At the head of those actions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hajj<\/strong> <strong>and Umrah<\/strong>: From the greatest of the actions the believer can perform in these blessed days, the great pillar of Islam that can only be performed in these days, the performance of Hajj. The person performing will ordinarily perform Umrah with their Hajj.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>As Sal\u0101h<\/strong>: After the performance of the compulsory prayers, That one increases in the perfomance of the nawaafil prayers, and they are many, for indeed the Prophet \ufdfa informed us as occurs in the hadeeth Qudsi: &#8220;..<strong><em>and indeed my servant does not cease drawing closer to me by way of nawaafil actions until I love him<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; (Bukhaari and Muslim)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>As Siy\u0101m<\/em><\/strong>: This is from the most tremendous actions one may perform during these days and beyond. Though fasting the first nine days is legislated, the day of Arafah in particular has special virtue mentioned in the hadeeth &#8220;<strong><em>Fasting on the day of Arafah, I anticipate that Allah will expiate the sins of the year before it and the sins of the year after it<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; (Muslim)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sadaqah<\/strong>: One of the best means of drawing close to Allah in these days, is that of giving in charity. If the charity is hidden then it is even greater. In the hadeeth of Abdullah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood the Prophet \ufdfa said: &#8220;<strong><em>Joining and maintaining bonds of kinship increases ones lifespan, and concealed charity extinguishes the anger of ones lord<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; (Collected by Ibn Sh\u0101h\u012bn in At Targh\u012bb Fi fadh\u0101&#8217;ilul A&#8217;m\u0101l and declared &#8216;Sah\u012bh&#8217; by Shaikh Alb\u0101ni in Sah\u012bhul J\u0101mi\u2019 (3766)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abundant Dhikr<\/strong>: Im\u0101m Bukh\u0101ri mentioned: Ibn Umar and Abu Hurairah would go out to the marketplaces in the ten days of Dhul Hijjah and make takbir and the people would make takbir following suit. It is important to note that &#8216;following suit&#8217; does not mean in unison or in congregation as is understood by some, but merely that they would initiate the people making takbir after hearing them making it. This is what is referred to as the takbir Al Mutlaq (Absolute takbir performed thoughout the ten days of dhul Hijjah up until the last of the days of tashreeq which ends with the setting of the sun on the 13th day of Dhul Hijjah.) We also have what is referred to as the takbir Al Muqayad (restricted Takb\u012br). This is a reference to the takbir that is made after each salaah. it begins from fajr on the day of Arafah and ends with the setting of the sun on the 13th day of Dhul Hijjah. There is no doubt that making dhikr of Allah generally has many great benefits. The Prophet said as occurs in the hadeeth of Abu Darda: &#8220;<strong><em>Should I not inform you of the best of your actions, and the purest of them with your lord, and the one that raises your station the most, better for you than giving silver and gold in charity, better for you than that you should meet your enemy (upon the battlefield) and that they strike your necks and you strike theirs<\/em><\/strong>?
