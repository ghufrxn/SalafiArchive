Evidence in any issue with them, returns back to that which is indicated by these sources, and opposition of the methodology revolves around opposition of this.<\/p>\n<p>Many seem to consider the book and the sunnah as the <i><b>only<\/b><\/i> evidence in our Deen and neglect the evidence of the concensus of the Salaf and their principles? Is this not what makes us Salafi?<\/p>\n<p>Our duty then, is to learn what they (the Salaf) were upon and cling to it. And to know that the principles of our methodology stem from this.<\/p>\n<p>This is Salafiyah.<\/p>\n<p>He who opposes these well known foundations and learns of his own error, must correct it, or Ahlus Sunnah will correct it for him (if the mistake was private, correction is done in private, if it was public (i.e. a public lecture or article) then his correction must likewise be public), in accordance with giving sincere advice to the Muslims in general.<\/p>\n<p>One of the problems we have in this time, is the distance many have from these foundations, either they ignore them after knowing them, or they are ignorant of their application, or they are ignorant of them in totality.<\/p>\n<p>Our Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn H\u0101di Al Madkhali used to say often, that the problem with many people is that they are detached from the books of the Salaf. If they were connected, they would be clear about the positions of the Salaf they claim to ascribe to and follow.<\/p>\n<p>What I intend with this simple series is to highlight some of these principles of the salaf and the manner in which some of those who have weak\u00a0implimentation of these principles (known as the Mumayyi\u2019ah) oppose these principles, or create principles of their own, and attempt to attribute them to the methodology. But certainly, from the blessings of Allah upon this Ummah, is that Allah establishes for this ummah individuals who defend these principles and detect when they are being opposed, regardless of how cunningly the proponents of this deviation defend and spread their misguidance.<\/p>\n<p>This methodology is inherited from those who possess it (i.e. the people of knowledge), it is not based upon guesswork or conjecture, nor acting upon what we deem to be &#8216;obvious&#8217;. Neither should it be presumed that everyone referred to as an \u2018\u0100lim\u2019 must, by necessity be knowledgeable concerning it. Such that if one \u2018took from the scholars\u2019 they too must be knowledgeable and aware of it.<\/p>\n<p>This was an affair well-known.<\/p>\n<p><u>Ibn Wahb (d.197H)<\/u>\u00a0&#8211; \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 &#8211; mentioned:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>I met three<\/em><\/strong><strong><em> hundred and sixty scholars, but had it not bee<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>n for M<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>lik Ibn Anas and Al Laith Ibnus Sa\u2019d, I would have gone astray in relation to the affair of knowledge<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Dhamul Kal\u0101m P876)<\/p>\n<p><u>Abu Thowr (d.240H)<\/u>\u00a0&#8211; \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 &#8211; mentioned:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>Ish<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>q Ibn R<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>huy, Hussain Al Kar<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>b<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u012b<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>si and I, did not leave our innovation until we met (Im<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>m) Ash Sh<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>fi\u2019i<\/em><\/strong>\u201d (Al Hilyah 9\/103)<\/p>\n<p><u>Im<\/u><u>\u0101<\/u><u>m Al Humaidi (Abdullah Ibn Az Zubair (d. 219H))<\/u>\u00a0&#8211; \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 &#8211; mentions:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>We used to wish to refute the people of philosophical rhetoric, but we were not proficient at doing so, until (Im<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>m) Ash-Shafi\u2019i came to us, and thus he opened it up to us<\/em><\/strong>.\u201d (Man\u0101qib Ash-Sh\u0101fi\u2019i P42)<\/p>\n<p>Even though <strong><em>Im<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>m Ash-Shafi\u2019i <\/em><\/strong>said about him: &#8220;<em><strong>I havent seen an individual suffering from phlegm, greater in memory than Al Humaidi<\/strong><\/em>!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><u>Amr\u00a0Ibnil Abb<\/u><u>\u0101<\/u><u>s\u00a0Al B\u0101hili<\/u>\u00a0(d. 235H) &#8211; \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 &#8211;\u00a0 said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Abdullah ibn D\u0101wood al Khar\u012bbi<\/em> said to <em>Abdur Rahm\u0101n Ibn Mahdi\u00a0(d. 198H)<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAre you Qadari?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He replied:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>My teachers were Ham<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>d Ibn Zaid and Yaz<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u012b<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>d Ibn Zurai\u2019, from which of the two of them would I have taken (the bid\u2019ah of) Qadr from!?\u201d <\/em><\/strong>(Al K\u0101mil\u201d 1\/203)<\/p>\n<p>Thus seeking knowledge does not necessitate that a person will gain correct <b><i>detailed<\/i><\/b> knowledge of the methodology of the salaf, just as being from the people of knowledge does not, by default, necessitate that this scholar is skilled in the field of the intricasies of the methodology, since being knowledgable concerning good, does not automatically necessitate detailed knowledge of evil.<\/p>\n<p>Hudhaifah &#8211; \u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647 &#8211; mentioned &#8220;<b><i>the people used to ask about the good but I used to ask about evil, fearing it will befall me<\/i><\/b>..&#8221; therefore Hudhaifa would have had knowledge of evil that may not have been possessed by others.<\/p>\n<p><em>Im\u0101m Ibn Abi H\u0101tim<\/em> mentions with his chain of narration going back to <em>Abdur rahm\u0101n Ibn Mahdi<\/em> (d. 198H) who said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>The people (scholars) are of types:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>From them is he who is an Im<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>m in the Sunnah (i.e. knowledge of the methodology) and an Im<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u0101<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>m in Had<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u012b<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>th (i.e. knowledge of had<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u012b<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>th, its sciences, its men etc).

The people of innovation are the first of the people who this science is applied upon.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The doubts we will discuss in this series th<strong>e<\/strong>n, are doubts raised by those who have little true knowledge of the methodology of the Salaf. Hence they oppose the manhaj in various ways and then request \u2018evidence\u2019 that their opposition is incorrect. Opposition is opposition; the only thing that must be\u00a0known, is that such and such a person actually said or wrote the statement. It is sufficient, as <i>evidence<\/i> of his error, for us to know, that he has opposed agreed upon principles of our Salaf. But he who is ignorant of them&#8230;is ignorant of them! While he who is aquainted with these principles, only has to hear of the opposition to know the individual has strayed from the path of the Salaf. Either he makes taubah and rectifys himself, or he persists upon error without change.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">These doubts are not new, but regurgitated doubts reoccurring from time to time. In our era, there are a number of individuals also attributed to knowledge, who have promoted these doubts in our communities over the years, in the guise of &#8216;principles&#8217;. At the head of them <i>Ali Hasan Al Halabi<\/i> and <i>Abul Hasan Al Maribi Al Misri<\/i> among others. To the extent, that the one who is ignorant of the realities of the <i><b>true<\/b><\/i> manhaj of the Salaf, opposes it, and vehemently despises it, believes the aforementioned principles to be <b>true<\/b> Salafiyah, and to oppose these principles of theirs, is to oppose true Salafiyah, and is &#8216;destroying our communities&#8217;, while the truth of the matter is, these <i>principles<\/i> are destroying our communities, splitting our ranks and creating small pockets of individuals who feel &#8216;disenfranchised&#8217; in fringe groups, displeased with the Salafi &#8216;state of affairs&#8217;, this is where the problem lies, not with the manhaj or the true methodology of the Salaf of this Ummah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">When people gather around this falsehood we have division in our ranks.<\/p>\n<p>Thus we will mention, in as simple a manner as possible, these doubts, and the responses of the people of knowledge to them. At the head of those scholars, the responses of the vanguard of the manhaj in our era, our Shaikh Al &#8216;Al\u0101mah Rabee&#8217; Ibn H\u0101di Al Madkhali, may Allah preserve him.<\/p>\n<p>Since in reality, their issue is actually with these scholars, they are the real target, they are the ones our real grievience is with, they are the real problem, attention must be turned away from them, the students in the west are but a intermediary annoyance.
