All of them say a similar statement to mine, and they all are in agreement with my opinion. Indeed Allah has sent you to men and women, and we have believed in you and we follow you. We (females) are responsible for tending to the homes and we are the place where men fulfill their desires, in addition to carrying their children (during pregnancy). But the men are preferred over us due to the merits gained for attending the Friday congregational prayer, attending burial procedures and also fighting in the way of Allah. If they leave their homes, we protect their wealth and we also raise their children. (With this being the case) do we\u00a0share in their\u00a0great reward, oh Messenger of Allah (salallaahu \u2018alaihi was sallam)?<\/p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, the Prophet (salallaahu \u2018alaihi was sallam) turned toward his male companions and said:<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever heard a female inquiring about the affair of her religion in a better manner than this female?<\/p>\n<p>The companions replied: Indeed we did not perceive a woman would be guided to such an affair\u00a0, Oh Messenger of Allah (salallaahu \u2018alaihi was sallam)!<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet (salallaahu \u2018alaihi was sallam) then replied to her: Return oh Asma, and inform the group of females that being a good wife to your husband, exerting yourself to please him, and making him pleased with you is equivalent (in reward) to all of what you have mentioned concerning the men!<\/p>\n<p>So she turned\u00a0away saying: La illaha illallah, Allahu Akbar, due to the joy she felt (after hearing the Prophet\u2019s reply)&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>(Collected by Ibn &#8216;Asaakir in &#8216;Taareekh Damishq (2\/609)<\/p>\n<p>Excerpts from the comments of Shaikh Naasir around the Hadeeth<\/p>\n<p>Shaikh Al Albaani mentions: &#8216;<em><strong>Da&#8217;eef (weak)<\/strong><\/em>&#8216;:\u00a0In its isnaad is Abu Sa&#8217;eed As Saahili Jubaili and have not been able to find anyone who deems him trustworthy&#8230;thus he is majhool Al Haal (his condition is unknown)<\/p>\n<p>I also believe that there is a break in the chain between Muslim ibn Ubaid and (the Narrator of the hadeeth) Asmaa bint Yazeed because i have not seen anyone establish that he narrated from her. He narrated from Anas ibn Maalik and Abi Usaib and a group of taabi&#8217;een.
