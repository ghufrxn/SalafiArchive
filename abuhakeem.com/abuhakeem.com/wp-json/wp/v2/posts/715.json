While the key to the hereafter is in hunger (I.e due to fasting). The origin of good in the dunya and the hereafter is in the fear of Allah. Indeed Allah gives his dunya to those who he loves and those he does not love. Hunger (i.e. fasting and its reward) is a treasure preserved with him, that he does not give except to the one he loves specifically. For me to give up a morsel from my late meal (i.e. due to fasting) is more beloved to me than for me to eat it and stand in prayer from the beginning to the end of the night<\/em><\/strong>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Collected by Abdur Razzaaq As San&#8217;aani in Al Musannaf 3\/307)<\/p>\n<p>Abu Dardaa said:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<strong><em>If it were not for three things I wish not to remain in the dunya:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>1.
