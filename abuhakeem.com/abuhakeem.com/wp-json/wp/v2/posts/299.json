Shaikh Al Albaani clarified that the reason for its weakness was the presence of Imaam Abu Haneefah in its chain of narration. A question that arose after that was: &#8216;But is Abu Haneefah weak in Hadeeth?!&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>In order to clarify the issue i quote here the research of Shaikh Al Albaani concerning the affair:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shaikh Al Albaani mentions rahimahullah<\/strong> :<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI mentioned back there (Under hadeeth 397) that Abu Haneefah has been declared weak (by the scholars of Hadeeth ) in Hadeeth. In order to bring clarity to this I say:<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned there that Abu Haneefah \u2013 Rahimahullah \u2013 was declared weak due to his memory by <strong>(Imaam) Al Bukhaari (Imaam) Muslim, (Imaam) Nasaa\u2019I and Ibn \u2018Adi<\/strong> and others from the Imaams of Hadeeth. So I will mention here the quotes from the Imaams\u00a0(of Hadeeth)\u00a0i have\u00a0indicated and others from whom this statement has authentically come. That the reader may be upon clarity in the affair and so that none can claim about what we mentioned there (i.e that he is weak in hadeeth) that this is Ijtihaad (i.e. his personal conclusion based upon his own analysis) from me, rather it is itibaa\u2019 (pure following) of the people of knowledge, understanding and specialism. Allah the Mighty and Exalted has stated \u201c<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>&#8220;Ask the people of Knowledge if you do not know\u201d (Suratul Nahl Vs 43)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>And he has said:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>\u201cAsk of it one who is well aquainted\u201d\u00a0 (Suratul Furqaan Vs 59)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Imaamul Bukhaari<\/strong> said in \u2018Taareekhul Kabeer\u2019 (4\/2\/81) \u2018<em>Sakatoo \u2018Anhu\u2019<\/em> (this statement of Imaamul Bukhaari literally means: \u2018they remained quiet about him\u2019 That is in reference to the Imaams of Hadeeth. But this statement if it comes from Imaam Bukhaari then it means that they left narrating from him since Imaam al Bukhaari was well known to be subtle in his statements of Jarh. <strong>Imaam Ibn Katheer<\/strong> mentions: \u201c<em>If Imaamul Bukhaari says about a narrator \u2018Sakatoo \u2018anhu\u2019 or \u2018Feehi Nadhr\u2019 (Lit: his affair is dubious) then he (the narrator) is at the lowest level ( of trustworthiness) as far as he is concerned, due to the fact that he was subtle with his disparaging statements<\/em>\u201d ikhtisaar \u2018Uloomil Hadeeth p89.

None of his narrations are authentic other than a little more the ten, while he actually narrates some three hundred hadeeth, some of them popular, while some are strange narrations but they are all narrated in this fashion.

He also narrates from At Thowri (Imaam sufyaan Ath Thowri) that he said: &#8220;<em>He is not Trustworthy<\/em>&#8221; and from An Nadhr ibn Shameel who said: &#8220;<em>He is abandoned in Hadeeth<\/em>&#8220;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Imaamudh Dhahabee<\/strong> mentions in &#8216;Dewaan Ad Dhu&#8217;afaa'(1-2\/215\u0642): &#8221; <em>An Nu&#8217;maan Al Imaam &#8211; Rahimahullah Ibn Adee said: The majority of that which he narrates is an error or has in it\u00a0incorrect alterations of words or has incorrect additions in them, though he does have some good ahaadeeth. Imaamun Nasaa&#8217;ee said: &#8220;He is not strong in Hadeeth and he makes many errors and mistakes even though his narrations are few&#8221; Imaam Ibn Ma&#8217;een said: &#8220;Do not pen down his hadeeth&#8221;. This narration from Ibn Ma&#8217;een means that with him Abu Haneefah is considered among the weak narrators, which explains that the statement that has come from Al Haafidh (ibn Hajr)\u00a0in &#8216;Tahdheeb&#8217; wherein Ibn Hajr narrates that Ibn Ma&#8217;een declares him trustworthy, is not the only statement that Ibn ma&#8217;een has made concerning him. The reality is that the opinions of Ibn Ma&#8217;een about the imaam are at variance. On occasions he declares him trustworthy and on other occasions he declares him weak as in this narration. On other occasions he says in that which ibn Muhriz narrates from him in &#8216;Ma&#8217;rifatur Rijaal (1\/6\/1): &#8220;Abu Haneefah was &#8216;Laa Ba&#8217;sa bihi&#8217; (This is a term used by the scholars of hadeeth to refer to one whos ahaadeeth may be written down for the purpose of analysis and comparison with the ahaadeeth of the other Imaams not sole\u00a0reliance upon them) and he did not used to lie&#8221; and he said on another occasion: &#8221; Abu Haneefah as far as we are concerned is from the people of truthfulness, he was not accused of lying&#8221; (Shaikh Albaani continues): &#8220;There is no doubt with us that Abu Haneefah is from the people of truthfulness! but that is not sufficient for us to rely upon his hadeeth until (the state of) his precision, integrity and memory is added to that, and this is what is not established for him &#8211; Rahimahullah rather that which is established is the opposite, as is seen from the testimonies of the aforementioned Imaams. And they are those who one will not go astray if he holds on to their testimonies and follows their statements. This though, does not affect in any way the station of Abu Haneefah &#8211; Rahimahullah in his deen and his piety and his fiqh as some of\u00a0his staunch followers wrongly presume (and misunderstand). For how many a Jurist, Judge or righteous, upright individual has been criticised by the scholars of Hadeeth in that which concerns their memory or them not being precise, but that does not affect their deen or\u00a0known uprightness, and this is an affair that is not hidden from those who busy themselves studying the biographies of the narrators&#8230;&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>(See Silsilatul Ahaadeeth Ad Dha&#8217;eefah: 1\/661-666)<\/p>\n<p>Wallahu ta&#8217;aalaa A&#8217;lam<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/abuhakeembilal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">www.twitter.com\/abuhakeembilal<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article explores the scholarly views on Imam Abu Hanifah&#8217;s status as a Hadith narrator.
