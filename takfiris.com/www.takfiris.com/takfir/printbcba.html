<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The 20th century <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> are a by-product of the Marxist, Socialist, Leninist ideologies that were distilling in the minds of individuals like <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>see here</a>) and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?rzaoo>see here</a>). Taking the concept of revolution (ideological and physical) as a means of establishing social justice was a theme incorporated into the writings of ignorant 20th century thinkers, the  most prominent amongst them being Hassan al-Banna, Abu Alaa Mawdudi, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani. This created the framework that gave birth to the Kharijite ideology of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a>. These are the true and real origins of the <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> of the 20th century. However, over the decades, and as the Salafi scholars exposed them, their figureheads and their doctrines, they have attempted to resemble the Salafis more and more as a means of veiling their falsehood.    <P>
It is authentically narrated from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> are (<span class='arb'>&#1587;&#1601;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;</span>) which can be loosely translated as "foolish-minded." The earlier and first <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> were of course in a much better situation than the contemporary <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> because the contemporaries do not consider lying to be a great deal whereas the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old, out of their exaggerated piety, wrongly believed it would make them disbelievers and feared it a great deal. On this count and many others, there is no comparison between the earlier and modern <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. There are remnants of the followers of <a href='tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> who have resorted to various labels after the Muslims became aware of their group and its devious methodology, and over the past few years they have hijacked the Salafi label, wrongly thinking it will veil their bid'ah and dalaalah which they procaim openly. They cannot name a single Salafi scholar who is upon their way in this time and this is because they have no scholars, they only have the likes of Abu Hamzah al-Misree (who has recently revealed his <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>connections and dealings</a> with MI5 in his court case in the US as part of his defence argument!) - and those like him from the straying ignoramuses. In the UK, such foolish-minded youths are operating under the label of <b>(so-called) Salafi Media UK</b>, and we will look at some of their main speakers in thi series.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The word retard in its dictionary meaning that is being used here, refers to "<i>a foolish person</i>", one who is "<i>stupid, ineffective</i>" and is similar to the word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) in Arabic, which means, "<i>stupid, ignorant, silly</i>" and what is similar to that. Use of word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) can be found in the speech of some of the Scholars to refer to disparaged individuals deserving of the label.  </blockquote></div> <P>

In the video below <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK") mentions what he believes to be a name of Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/retarded-takfiri-abuwaleed.png width="525" border=0>    <P>
He states (<a href=assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-allahsnames.mp3>mp3</a>):    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-allahsnames.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Allaah (AzzawaJall) He has rights, He has particular haqooq [meaning, huqooq, rights], He has particular Asmaa was-Sifaat and they are exclusively for Him, He is (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;</span>), there is no (<span class='arb'>&#1581;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;</span>) but Him...</blockquote>    <P>
The name (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;</span>) means "the Shaver" - we seek refuge in Allaah from such ignorance - the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old were ignorant, but they were not <b>this</b> ignorant. It is this very grade of retard that <u>makes takfir</u> of the Salafi scholars of our time! It is one thing to be misguided, but it is another thing to be made a display of humiliation in that misguidance.    <P>
The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) described one of the traits of these people as "<i>they speak with the best speech of creation</i>" and much of what they say (Allaah's law etc.) is received by many as being lofty and noble speech, yet alongside that, the manner of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in addressing them was to refer to them as (<span class='arb'>&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1585;</span>), "dogs of hellfire." Their ignorance (jahl) coupled by extreme fervor and absence of scholars amongst them leads them to misguidance (of themselves and others) and they bring about harm and destruction in numerous ways. <P>
