<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The 20th century <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> are a by-product of the Marxist, Socialist, Leninist ideologies that were distilling in the minds of individuals like <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>see here</a>) and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?rzaoo>see here</a>). Taking the concept of revolution (ideological and physical) as a means of establishing social justice was a theme incorporated into the writings of ignorant 20th century thinkers, the  most prominent amongst them being Hassan al-Banna, Abu Alaa Mawdudi, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani. This created the framework that gave birth to the Kharijite ideology of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a>. These are the true and real origins of the <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> of the 20th century. However, over the decades, and as the Salafi scholars exposed them, their figureheads and their doctrines, they have attempted to resemble the Salafis more and more as a means of veiling their falsehood.    <P>
It is authentically narrated from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> are (<span class='arb'>&#1587;&#1601;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;</span>) which can be loosely translated as "foolish-minded." The earlier and first <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> were of course in a much better situation than the contemporary <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> because the contemporaries do not consider lying to be a great deal whereas the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old, out of their exaggerated piety, wrongly believed it would make them disbelievers and feared it a great deal. On this count and many others, there is no comparison between the earlier and modern <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. There are remnants of the followers of <a href='tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> who have resorted to various labels after the Muslims became aware of their group and its devious methodology, and over the past few years they have hijacked the Salafi label, wrongly thinking it will veil their bid'ah and dalaalah which they procaim openly. They cannot name a single Salafi scholar who is upon their way in this time and this is because they have no scholars, they only have the likes of Abu Hamzah al-Misree (who has recently revealed his <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>connections and dealings</a> with MI5 in his court case in the US as part of his defence argument!) - and those like him from the straying ignoramuses. In the UK, such foolish-minded youths are operating under the label of <b>(so-called) Salafi Media UK</b>, and we will look at some of their main speakers in thi series.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The word retard in its dictionary meaning that is being used here, refers to "<i>a foolish person</i>", one who is "<i>stupid, ineffective</i>" and is similar to the word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) in Arabic, which means, "<i>stupid, ignorant, silly</i>" and what is similar to that. Use of word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) can be found in the speech of some of the Scholars to refer to disparaged individuals deserving of the label.  </blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Takfiri Retard: "It is From the Sunnah of the Prophets To Be Ridiculed by the British Media" and Abu Hamza (Former Night-Club Bouncer Turned Takfiri Kharijite and MI5 Collaborator) "Is Like The Prophets Ibrahim and Yusuf"</font>    <P>
Below is a video where you see a Salafiyyah-Faking Takfiri by the name of <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (from the so-called "Salafi Media UK") speaking out in defence of Abu Hamzah al-Misri (former night-club bouncer turned <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>MI5 collaborator</a>). This same individual makes <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Salafi scholars and the rulers of the Muslims without exception and uses vile, filthy language to describe the Salafi scholars. These Takfiri <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> are remnants of <a href='tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> and have a history of adopting different names and labels. The use of the label "Salafi" is fraudulent and they employ it as a veil and cover to deceive other Muslims.    <P>

Abu Waleed states (<a href=assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-sunnahprophets.mp3>mp3</a>):    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-sunnahprophets.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
Here is the transcript (easier read than heard):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>However, I think we should take into light of course, the message of those people who are the preachers, whom the British media regard as preachers and that message is something that resembles the message of Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Sahaabah. And it is the Sunnah of the Anbiyaa and the Sunnah of the Companions in fact for them to be ridiculed and attacked by the mainstream British media. Sad we find ourselves as Muslims, living in a Western society, whereby Muslims are having this lack of identity and lack of cultural understanding, culturally weak, Islamically culturally weak, I mean to understand how in fact people like Shaykh Abu Hamzah, in fact they remind us of Shaykh Umar bin al-Khattaab and Uthmaan and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and the Anbiyaa [Prophets] like Ibrahim (alayhis salaam) and Yusuf (alayhis salaam) who are not silent about the evil around them...</blockquote>    <P>
As the reader will note, there are some questions which arise from the above remarks such as: What is the definition of the Sunnah this foolish-minded Takfiri is working with such that it is from "the Sunnah of the Prophets" to be  "ridiculed and attacked by mainstream British media"?  How do former nightclub bouncers turned MI5 informants and collaborators (<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>see here</a>) resemble the Prophets like Ibrahim and Yusuf (alayhimaa as-salaam)? When will we see this Takfiri  publish a video in which <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Abu Hamza is established and justified because of dealings with MI5 (security services)? <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> like <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK") often make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Muslims with the claim that they have dealings or connections with security services of Western governments. These are just a few of the large number of questions that are raised which indicate the pretentious and contradictory nature of the da'wah of the Takfiri <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>.    <P>
The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) described one of the traits of these people as "<i>they speak with the best speech of creation</i>" and much of what they say (Allaah's law etc.) is received by many as being lofty and noble speech, yet alongside that, the manner of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in addressing them was to refer to them as (<span class='arb'>&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1585;</span>), "dogs of hellfire." Their ignorance (jahl) coupled by extreme fervor and absence of scholars with them leads them to misguidance (of themselves and others) and they bring about harm and destruction in numerous ways.    <P>
