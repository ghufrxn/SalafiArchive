<blockquote>The following was posted by one of Shaykh Abdul-Mushin al-Abbaad's sons on Twitter:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/shk-abdul-muhsin-iraq-baiah.png width="445" border=0>  </blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I mentioned to the father, Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad (hafidhahullaah) about what has occurred from some of the fools in the Land of the Haramayn of giving the pledge of allegiance to al-Baghdadi and they say "He is the khalifah of the Muslims." He replied, "They have pledged allegiance to the devil."</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote>  <b>Note:  </b>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a <b>Takfiri murderer</b> who has been responsible over the past few years for overseeing, if not directly participating in, terrorist attacks in and around Baghdad, targeting those deemed to be "apostates" and this includes Sunnis who have been forced in the aftermath of war, to work in the army or the police or other bodies connected to government (as a means of feeding their families). Genuine scholars of Islam, Sunnah and Salafiyyah do not pass judgement upon these people as disbelievers in this way, this is the way of the Takfiri <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> whose alleged "jihad" is killing those deemed "apostates" because they have connections with the government. There are circumstances in Iraq, in the aftermath of war, where Sunnis are trying to get on with their lives after two decades of hardships (this includes finding employment) and one cannot summarily judge all such people as "apostates" in this blanket manner. These affairs should be returned back to genuine major Scholars. All of this shows the truly evil nature of what these people are doing and what they are upon.   </blockquote>   <P>
