<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> and the Innovators</font>    <P>
Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> was a person of knowledge who in the early 1990s got involved, unfortunately, with personalities like Muhammad al-Misery and his organization called CDLR (an organization practically working to effect Leninist and Marxist type revolutions in Muslim lands). Through this interaction the Shaykh was led to hold erroneous opinions towards Innovators such as Hasan al-Banna and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>. He proceeded to defend these individuals, not upon knowledge and baseerah or any kind of detailed research, but out of sentiments and out of the affectation he suffered from as a result of being involved with such unsavouries. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) and other scholars blasted the CDLR in very powerful words (we have the audio and will publish separately on this site inshaa'Allaah) and the scholars expressed their disappointment with the likes of <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> getting involved with these people. Unfortunately that connection harmed the Shaykh in that he became blinded to what these people were really upon, for he, in his methodology, was not upon the doctrines and methodologies that these takfiri revolutionaries were upon, even if he was deceived by them in his perception of the Innovators such as <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and Bannaa. As such, whilst the truth is clear expressed in many of his statements regarding the rulers, the issues of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, the issue pertaining to the <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> that the rulers have been put to trial with, revolting, terrorism and so on, he unfortunately, showed lenience towards these Innovators even if the truth that is found in much of his speech actually convicts these very same people. Due to Shaykh Ibn Jibreen's persistence in defending these people however, Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> was powerfully and forcefully refuted, and his contradiction made clear by the likes of Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee who wrote a series of refutations against him, and also expelled him from Ahl us-Sunnah for his continued allegiance to and defence of Jahmite Ash'ari and Sufi Innovators  (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/series/concerning-shaykh-ibn-jibreens-defence-of-hasan-al-banna-and-sayyid-qutb.cfm>see this series here</a>) and <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> such as <a href='tags/usamah-bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Usamah <a href="tags/bin-laden.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Bin Laden</font></a></font></a> (<a href=index9894.html?owscq>see here</a>). <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Usamah <a href='tags/bin-ladin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Ladin</font></a> and Followers Make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Muslims</font>    <P>
It is important to note that while Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> did not agree with the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a> of the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>, he unfortunately displayed a lenient position towards them in many of his statements, clearly opposing other Scholars such as Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin, Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan, and others. The reason for this has been explained above - in that he unfortunately had affiliations with the harakiyyeen (activists) which tainted his perceptions. <b>It is for this reason that you see all the people of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a> attaching themselves to him</b>. However, despite this, you still see certain truths being expressed in some of his speech, because that truth is undeniable.  These statements that we are bringing of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a>, together with the statements of the others Scholars <u>are a final nail in the coffin</u> of those people who have been deceiving the Ummah for many long years. They certainly got their mileage out of Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a>, <b>but that period is now over</b>.    <P>

This was the Afghan war in the 1980s, and in which the Americans were providing support against a communist aggressor.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Then the tribulation of the Gulf occurred, which is in the year 11 (meaning 1411H, that is 1990CE)...</blockquote>    <P>
This is in reference to the aggression of Saddam Hussain, a communist ba'thist upon whose (ba'thist) regime the Scholars, such as Shaykh Ibn Baz had made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>.    <P>

So this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> was rejected against him, which is <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the (Saudi) state and those surrounding it. And this is what was rejected against him. And he is a mujtahid (in this). </blockquote>    <P>
This claim of excusable ijtihaad is a serious error, and opposes the usool of Ahl us-Sunnah, for Ahl us-Sunnah declare as innovators those who enter into the well-known major issues that the whole Ummah is clear about, such as the innovations of the  Khawaarij, Qadariyyah and others (see further below). <b>In this there are no excuses</b>. Further, ijtihaad has requirements and conditions of which Usamah <a href='tags/bin-ladin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Ladin</font></a> has none. Further, when there are present Imaams of the Sunnah in your midst, then what excuse do you have of making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of entire nations and states and the Muslims therein?    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of a Muslim, we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of him.</blockquote>    <P>
Meaning, we do not make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of a Muslim, meaning here the rulers of these states. This shows <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a>, up until he died considered Saudi and the Gulf states to be Muslim states upon whom <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is not made and to whom obedience is obligatory and anyone opposing this is from the "<i>Kharijite, Dogs of Hellfire</i>" (in the Shaykhs own words in another fatwa - <a href=index1e1d.html?srjss >see here</a>).    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>However, we say (about Usamah) that he erred in this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, and that those who gave him sanctuary and supported him (those around him) are to be considered like him in that they make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Muslims.</blockquote>    <P>
Usamah erred and became an innovator by making blanket <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>. And here the Shaykh <b>corroborates with his own testimony</b> that those with him and around him also were guilty of this <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>.     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This is the correct saying regarding him.</blockquote>    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Is There the Excuse of "Ijtihaad" For Non-Scholars in Making <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Nations, States and Societies?</font>    <P>
The definitions of the linguists and scholar of "ijtihaad" is summarized as "<i>Expending efforts to arrive at certainty regarding a sharee'ah rulings</i>" and a "mujtahid" is "<i>A faqih, jurist (a Scholar) who expends efforts, (time and resources etc.) to arrive at certainty in a Sharee'ah ruling</i>". And from the conditions of a mujtahid is that he is an aalim (has knowledge of) the Book and the Sunnah, the issues of Ijmaa' (consensus) and knowledge of the Arabic language, and that he is grounded in the usool (foundational principles) of fiqh (jurisprudence), that he has knowledge an-naasikh wal-mansookh (the abrogating and abrogated) and understands the maqaasid (goals, objectives) of the Sharee'ah. This is what you find from the people of knowledge regarding ijtihaad, and the mujtahid and the faqih in the well-known classical books.     <P>
Usamah <a href='tags/bin-ladin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Ladin</font></a>, in light of all of this, <u>is clearly not a mujtahid</u>, because he is not known for sitting and taking knowledge from the Scholars, or having studied books, or fiqh, or aqidah, and there is nothing of knowledge from him - all that has ever come from him is <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and reviling of the Scholars - there are no traces of knowledge or teaching from him, <u>and his specialty was construction, constructing buildings and the likes</u>, not issuing fatwas and giving great and mighty rulings upon which the lives, welfare, safety and sanctity of other Muslims depends upon - especially in the presence of a large number of senior Scholars.    <P>
Finally, this quote ends the conversation and puts an end to the matter quite decisively: This is from the book of Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani, "al-Jaami'" and it is on page 121:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/qayarawani-ijtihaad-bidah.gif border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah: <b>Is that a person whose ijtihaad leads him to an innovation is not excused</b>, because the Khawaarij made ijtihaad in [their] ta'weel [faulty interpretation] and they were not excused, since they departed, by way of their ta'weel from [the way of] the Companions, and he (alayhis salaam) described them as maariqeen (those who exit) from the religion.     <P>
And [from the saying of Ahl us-Sunnah] is treating the mujtahid in the ahkaam (one who strives at arriving at a ruling) to be rewarded even if he errs.</blockquote>    <P>
So that clarifies the issue in a manner that it needs no further clarifying, and this is the consensus of the Salaf, that excuse and reward is only for the mujtahid in the ahkaam who errs, as for the one who makes ijtihaad in bid'ah, and especially when it is a famous, well-known bid'ah whose opposition to the Book and the Sunnah is well-known and established, then there is no excuse for such people.    <P>
