<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Lashkar-e-Taiba is a <b>Takfiri Khariji</b> organization whose manhaj  identifies with the writings and methodologies of <a href=http://www.sayyidqutb.com/><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></a>, Mohammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, Abu A'laa Mawdudi, Hasan al-Banna and other figureheads who were poisoned with that 20th century fikr which gave birth to destructive political movements that brought nothing but vile partisanship and a burdensome toil upon the hearts, minds and bodies of millions of Muslims in their lands. This organization shows the face of Ahl al-Sunnah <u>but is in reality an Ikhwani, Aqlaani, Khaariji organization</u> which does not guide itself by the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah and simply uses the issue of Kashmir as a means to garner support from the average Muslim (most of whom are ignorant of important matters of Tawhid and are left that way) in order to serve its own political ends. Unfortunately, little is available in refutation of this hizb in English, Urdu or Arabic with the exception of a book published in 2009 titled "<i>Al-Burhaan Fi al-Radd alaa Lashkar Taibah al-Khaarijiyyah</i>" (2009, Karachi) with an introduction by the noble Shaykh, Ahmad bin Yahyaa al-Najmee (rahimahullaah). This type of refutation is much needed because this group receives financial support to fund its misguided activities which are similar to the activities of al-Ikhwan in Egypt where political goals are more important than the da'wah to the Tawheed of Allaah and if there is any mention of the Tawheed of Allaah it is from the angle of lip service in order to please and placate others and to deflect criticism. As for instilling Tawhid into the hearts and minds of the Muslims as a general, boad, inclusive manhaj, then this sect is not concerned with that, despite the fact that the land in which it operates is a land which is in the direst need of that. Inshaa'Allaah we will serialize some of the material in aforementioned book which draws upon the very writings and publications of this Takfiri Kharijite sect to illustrate its misguidance and remoteness from the way of Ahl al-Sunnah and from the Scholars who invite to the Salafi aqidah and manhaj. [We ask Allaah to reward the brother who kindly presented this book to us].</blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Main Figureheads and Publications of <a href="tags/laskhar-e-taiba.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Laskhar-e-Taiba</font></a></font>    <P>
<blockquote>These are some of the most important of their leaders and figureheads: <b>Hafidh Muhammad Sa'eed</b> (founder and administrative leader, head of the magazines <i>al-Ribaat</i> and <i>al-Dawah</i>), Hafidh Abdur-Rahman Makkee, Naveed Qamar, Qaadee Kashif Nayaaz, Ameer Hamzah, Hafidh Abdus-Salam Bahtawee, Zafar Iqbal, Abdul-Ghaffar A'waan, Muhammad Yusuf Tayyibee, Abdul-Ghaffar Madani, Nasar Javaid, Qari' Muhammad Ya'qub Abd al-Mannaan an-Noor Fawree, Abdullah Muntadhir, Ghulam Qadir Subhanee, Adnan al-Jehlumi al-Britanee... there are many more in the list, around 80 altogether (see pp.149-153).  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Major Publications</font>    <P>
<blockquote>As for their publications (where their manhaj and general orientation is espoused), they are:    <P>
<ul><li><b>Majalat ud-Da'wah</b>, which is issued every month in the Urdu language and it contains calamities, it is a political magazine filled with lies and deviations.  <li> <b>Majallah al-Ribaat</b>, which is issued every month  in the Urdu language, it is full of lies, deviations and stories. The hizbiyyoon and takfiriyyoon write therein.  <li> <b>Majallah al-Tayyibaat</b>, a magazine specifically for women.  <li> <b>Mudhakkirah al-Da'wah</b>  <li> <b>Ghazwa</b>, full of politics.  </ul></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Major Branches</font>    <P>
<blockquote>As for its major branches:    <P>
<ul><li> Headquarters in Lahore in Markaz al-Qaadisiyyaah  <li> Markaz Tayyibah - Shaykhpoorah  <li> Markaz Hudaiyybiyyah - Rawalpindi  <li> Markaz Khaybaradam - Siyalkot  <li> Markaz Aqsa (Masjid Taqwa) - Quetta, Baluchistan  <li> Masjid Umm al-Quraa - Sarhal  <li> Jami'ah ad-Diraasaat al-Islaamiyyah - Karachi  <li> Markaz Bab al-Islam - Haidarabaad   <li> Markaz Umm al-Quraa - Raheem Yar Khan  <li> Al-Ma'had al-Ilmee lid-Da'wah al-Islamiyyah - Mudhaffar Kurah  <li> Jami'ah Uthman bin Affaan - Bahawalpur  <li> Madrasah Hudhaifah bin al-Yaamaan - Mudhaffarabaad  </ul>    <P>
These are the  most important ones but there are other centres which range from small to large in the various towns and cities, and they take the form of schools and institutes.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Main Goals and Objectives</font>    <P>
<blockquote>  <ul><li> Turning people away from the da'wah (call) of the Prophets and Messengers, the call to Tawhid (in its broad comprehensive and detailed sense) and turning them to their claimed (version of) jihaad in Kashmir and other places.  <li> Calling the people to <a href='tags/revolt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolt</font></a> against the rulers, and inciting the people against them.  <li> Making <a href='tags/takfeer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfeer</font></a> of the rulers explicitly or by insinuation, and (focusing on) considering the rulers to be tawaagheet.  <li>  Striving to acquire rulership (for themselves) through the route of Jihaad as they claim  <li> Inciting the Muslims towards suicide missions, claiming that they are jihaad in the path of Allaah.  <li> Bringing about hatred amongst the Muslims towards the Scholars known for soundness in aqidah and manhaj and bringing about nearness to the Ahl al-Bid'ah.  <li> Their goal behind jihaad is not to make Allah's word supreme but it is centred around land and nation and bringing about - as they claim - a khaleefah for the Muslims.  <li> Inviting people to their claimed (version of) jihaad through the use of fables and stories (which are fabricated, invented and contain deviations), and with lies and innovations which have no basis.  <li> Calling the people to have loyalty and allegiance towards the Innovators and deviants such as the Raafidah, Deobandis and Barelwis for the sake of wealth.</ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
