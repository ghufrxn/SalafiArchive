<font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding <a href="tags/ali-al-timimi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ali al-Timimi</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=index938a.html?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=index13c7.html?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>) are boasting these days that <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" aqidah to the youth in the United Kingdom in the early 90s. This was when he had not fully transitioned to the da'wah of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and in those days he did speak a lot of truth, even if influences of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> were clearly manifest in some of his speech even at that time. What destroyed <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was a number of factors, the  most important of them being firstly his attachments to and infatuation with Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq, the Egyptian, through which he eventually got poisoned and overtaken by Qutb's exaggerated doctrines of <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a>. And secondly his long standing commitments towards the Innovators of IANA and his associations with <a href='tags/salaah-as-saawee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salaah as-Saawee</font></a> and other unsavouries amongst the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>. Signs of this affectation could be seen in the early 90s but it wasn't till after the mid-90s that his affair became manifest, and unfortunately it deteriorated from that point onwards after he turned his back upon many of the usool he was previously "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" to others before the mid-90s, and took a portion of the youth towards the Ikhwani methodologies of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and his likes. This shows that guidance is in Allaah's hands and having plenty of knowledge and understanding of issues does not actually equate to <i>guidance</i> in and of itself. <P>

In this audio recording from the early 90s, <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> responds to a question in which the questioner tries to imply the kufr of the <a href='tags/saudi-government.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Government</font></a> on account of the presence of usurious banks in Makkah and Madinah and what the questioner says is a "capitalist system", and the questioner cites Ibn Katheer as part of his insinuation of kufr in the question.    <P>

In this audio, he answers the question with the following points:    <P>
<ul><li> That if a people acknowledge that they have to abide by the Sharee'ah but fall into disobedience, then it would not take them outside the fold of Islaam, just like major sins do not expel a Muslim from Islaam.    <P>
<li> That <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> is a Muslim country and the Scholars know best their country and that all the Scholars say it is an Islamic country, even if there are some un-Islamic affairs found therein, and that its rulers are not apostates.    <P>
<li> That scholars from outside of the country, such as Shaykh al-Albani and Pakistan, India, Morocco and Egypt and other places also say that it is a Muslim country    <P>
<li> He mentions by passing that those who oppose what is said above are <u>the youth who are upon a deviant philosophy of Jihaad</u>  and he is referring here to the Leninist Jihaad that emerged in 1965, and which he explains in some detail (to follow shortly inshaa'Allaah).  </ul>    <P>
It should be pointed out that the aim of the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> is to make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the situation predominant in most Muslim lands today of the presence of <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> to varying degrees. To this end, they rally around the scenario that some scholars speak of when a Muslim ruler systematically abolishes the Sharee'ah in its entirety and puts another law in its place. As this is considered major kufr by the Scholars, these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> - who are remnants of the destructive movements set in motion by Qutb's Leninist teachings in the mid 1960s - found this as an avenue to justify their <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> (and thus Leninist-type revolution), deceiving the people into thinking that all the rulers present today, ruling over the Muslim lands have themselves abolished the Sharee'ah. None of the Scholars agree with them upon this falsehood. Even Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a> who went out of his way to defend Hassan al-Banna and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - and who was refuted with <u>a powerful refutation</u> by Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee for doing that (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/series/concerning-shaykh-ibn-jibreens-defence-of-hasan-al-banna-and-sayyid-qutb.cfm>see here</a>) - even in his words is a refutation and destruction of the manhaj of these people (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?umssw >see the article here</a>), he was not with those extremists.    <P>
The truth walhamdulillaah is becoming more and more manifest and the noose is being put around these <a href='tags/qutbis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbis</font></a> and <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and their deviant doctrines and methodologies, as historical facts and realities are brought together. Our genuine sincere advice to these people, whom we still consider brothers in Islaam,  is that they stop living the lie. <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> is no longer sustainable. You can't defend it any longer with those old shubuhaat. It's best to just come out clean and to remain in honour. Stop all the childish activities, and the display of those base, vile, lowly characteristics in trying to fight and belittle the truth and you might survive with a bit of dignity and honour.     <P>
