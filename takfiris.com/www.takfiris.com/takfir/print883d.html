<font class='titleHeadline'>The Kh&#257;rijite Who Incited Ahl al-Sunnah To Rebel Against the &#703;Ubaydi Sh&#299;&#703;ah and Then Engineered Their Slaughtering</font>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/tarteeb-madaarik.png align="right" style="margin:4px 0px 5px 10px;" border=0> In his book <i>Tart&#299;b al-Mad&#257;rik wa Taqr&#299;b al-Mas&#257;lik</i> Q&#257;&#7693;&#299; &#703;Iy&#257;&#7693; (rahimahull&#257;h) mentions the slaughtering of notable Scholars  of Ahl al-Sunnah when they got caught up in the <a href='tags/revolt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolt</font></a> of a Kharijite against the &#703;Ubayd&#299; B&#257;&#7789;iniyyah Sh&#299;&#703;ah in al-Qayraw&#257;n during the 4th century hijrah.  These B&#257;&#7789;iniyyah would openly revile the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Companions (radiyall&#257;hu anhum) on the streets  and Ahl al-Sunnah were severely oppressed. There was a <u>Kharijite</u> by the name of <b>Ab&#363; Yaz&#299;d Mukhallad  bin Kayd&#257;n</b>, he was much given to devotion and worship and was obeyed by his people. He revolted against the Ban&#299; &#703;Ubayd, incited the people against them, and had many victories, taking many cities.     <P>
Many of Ahl al-Sunnah thought that it was a duty upon them to <a href='tags/revolt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolt</font></a> due to the kufr of Ban&#299; &#703;Ubayd and so they joined with Ab&#363; Yaz&#299;d, without intending to come under his obedience. Those who joined him were Abu al-Fa&#7693;l al-Mumsee, Rab&#299;&#703; bin Sulaym&#257;n al-Qa&#7789;&#7789;&#257;n, Ibr&#257;&#7717;im bin Mu&#7717;ammad al-&#7716;anaf&#299;, &#703;Abd al-Malik bin Marw&#257;n as well as other notable Scholars and a group of civilians. They decided upon this after consulation to fight against "<i>a cursed mubaddil (alterer) of the religion (the &#703;Ubayd&#299; ruler)</i>" and they saw it as a means of expiation of their sins.     <P>
Then they went and on their way they incited the people to jih&#257;d, making <i>takb&#299;r</i>, <i>tahl&#299;l</i> and the likes through the streets and sending sal&#257;t upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and asking for mercy upon his family and companions and reciting verses from the Qur'&#257;n, "<b>And fight against the heads of kufr</b>" and "<b>Fight them, All&#257;h will punish them through your hands</b>..." A powerful jumu&#703;ah khutbah was given by A&#7717;mad bin Ab&#299; al-Wal&#299;d, inciting the people to jih&#257;d, and reviling the Ban&#299; &#703;Ubayd.     <P>
So the next morning the people went out with Ab&#363; Yaz&#299;d (al-Kh&#257;rij&#299;) for their jih&#257;d. They surrounded the &#703;Ubaydiyyah in the city of al-Mahdiyyah, and when Ab&#363; Yaz&#299;d saw this, and was certain of victory, <b>he manifested what he concealed of his Kh&#257;rijite doctrine</b> and he said to his associates, when you meet those people (the enemy) then expose the Scholars of al-Qayraw&#257;n so that their enemies can subdue them. <b>So then those whom All&#257;h willed (from Ahl al-Sunnah) were killed by the &#703;Ubaydiyyah and they included 35 people from the jurists and righteous</b>. This was in the month of Rajab 333H.    <P>
In the above account is a great and mighty lesson for those from Ahl al-Sunnah who are deceived today by the <a href='tags/revolt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolt</font></a> of a Takfiri Kharijite (Abu Bakr al-Baghd&#257;d&#299;) against the Shi&#703;ite government of Ir&#257;q and his alleged khil&#257;fah (<a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a>). This criminal has much Sunni blood on his hands due to his bombings of civilians in the streets of Baghdad since 2010. Pay heed to the statement of Im&#257;m al-&#256;jurr&#299; (d.360H) in his book <i>al-Shar&#299;&#703;ah</i>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>It is not permissible for the one who sees the uprising of a Kh&#257;rijite who has revolted against the leader, whether he is just or oppressive - so this person has revolted and gathered a group behind him, has pulled out his sword and has made lawful the killing of Muslims. It is not befitting for the  one who sees this that he becomes deceived by this person's recitation of the Qur'&#257;n, the length of his standing in prayer, nor his constant fasting, nor his good and excellent words in knowledge when it is clear to him that this person's way and methodology is that of the Khaw&#257;rij.</blockquote>     <P>
 <P>
