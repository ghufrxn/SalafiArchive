<b>Takfiri Implosion and Chaos Amongst the Kharijites</b>    <P>
The following news article (<a href=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/17435-isis-executes-one-of-its-sharia-judges>original source</a>) documents the chaos arising between the Takfiri <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a>. Before you read this news article which is reproduced below, a few notes:    <P>
<blockquote><b>One:</b> The famous statement of Wahb bin Munabbih (d. 110H), "I have reached the early part of Islam and by Allah, never were the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> formed into a jamaa'ah (group) except that Allaah split them asunder upon the evilness of the conditions (they were upon). None of them proclaimed his saying, save that Allaah struck his neck [through the agency of another]! The ummah has never united, ever, behind a man from the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. If Allaah had granted established for the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> with their opinion (ideology), the Earth would become corrupted, the paths would have been cut off, and the [routes of travel for the performance of] Hajj would have been cut off and then the affair of Islam would returned back to the days of ignorance (<a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a>), until the people would seek refuge in peaks of mountains - just as they were in the days of ignorance. And thereupon, more than ten or twenty men would appear, every single one of them claiming the khilaafah for himself, and with each man would be more than 10,000, and they would fight each other and witness against each other with disbelief (kufr)."    <P>
<b>Two:</b> <u>The Haddaadiyyah</u> are a splinter group from the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun and they appeared during the early to mid-90s with their extremist views, fraudulently cloaking themselves with the gown of Salafiyyah. Their aim was to infuse their extremism in the name of Salafiyyah in order to tarnish it. Their leader was Mahmood al-Haddaad. Today, their celebrity line-up includes a person called <b>Ahmad al-Haazimee</b> who has some wild statements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>. Some splits and further tribulations have appeared amongst these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>, and just as Wahb bin Munabbih noted more than 1300 years ago, this ideology is such that it implodes, divides and leads to mutual charges of disbelief.     <P>
<b>Three:</b> As the reader can see, attributing these <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> to Islam is a crime of the non-Muslims, the haters amongst them especially, given that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) exonerated Islam from these dogs and expelled them from it in the view of many scholars. Further, ascribing this extremism to Salafiyyah is another crime on top of that first one, since whover looks at the specific doctrines of the <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> will find that within the writings of Ibn Taymiyyah or Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his offspring is a clear rebuttal of them or at least further tafseel (detail) that invalidates their distortion and falsehood. From the greatest of the principles outlined by both of these scholars is the issue of the rulers and maintaining security and safety through obedience to them and not revolting, despite tyranny and excess.     <P>
<b>Four:</b> This issue is connected to that of the excuse of ignorance in matters that invalidate Islam, Imaan and Tawhid. Here are the views of the Salafi scholars on this issue:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (2) - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?zmhyr>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (5) - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?uufmf>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?wvnjp>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (4) - <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Raafidah - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?illhh>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (3) - <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Raafidah - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?gzrsz>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (2) - <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Raafidah - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?dkhtd>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (1) - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?obkwf>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?uncnb>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?ecksy>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?wwqny>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Takfir and the Excuse of Ignorance:</b> Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen - (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?xwouo>see here</a>)  </ul>    <P>
When you read through all of these statements from these Salafi scholars and give them consideration, you will see what difference there is between firmly-grounded scholars and barking hound dogs infected with rabies.</blockquote>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/isis-takfiris-hazimi.png width="525" border=0>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Social media activists who support the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (<a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a>) have said on Twitter that the organisation recently executed one of its Sharia judges on the grounds that the latter had "excessive takfiri tendencies".    <P>
According to Twitter users known for supporting the Hazimi trend within <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> - named after the Saudi figure Ahmed Al Hazimi who is known for his views that ignorance is no excuse to being denigrated as an infidel (a practice known as takfir) - claimed that ISIS's leadership has started to execute judges who are accused of excessively using <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> against those who should be exempt due to ignorance.    <P>
According to a number of Salafi Jihadi online forums, <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> detained Sheikh Abu Jaafar Al-Hattab and a number of other Sharia judges last September, the month in which Judge Abu Omar Al-Kuwaiti was mysteriously executed. Some linked Al-Kuwaiti's execution to his proclamation of Baghdadi as a kafir ("infidel").    <P>
Al-Hattab, a former member of the Sharia committee of the Ansar Sharia group in Tunisia, was known for his strictness in such matters. He had previously released an audio message in which he declared his stance on <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and said that the excuse of ignorance should not exempt people from being accused.    <P>
Observers noticed that <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> supporters failed to share the tweet regarding Al-Hattab's execution, whereas for the first times supporters of the Hazimi trend have gained prominence.    <P>
"Repent, Baghdadi, and purify your tawhid before you die, the day when neither wealth nor sons will avail, except those who meet Allah with a pure heart," read a tweet by one of Al-Hazimi's supporters.    <P>
Another Hazimi tweet, Fahdawi Dayghami, wrote on Twitter: "Why did the [Islamic] State kill Sheikh Abu Jaafar Al-Hattab and his brothers? You ask students to come to you then you kill them? What Khilafah [sic] is this? We will not forget his blood and the blood of his brothers."    <P>
A number of supporters of the Al-Nusra Front group and the Islamic State group previously accused Al-Hattab of issuing fatwas proclaiming all ISIS's opponents as infidels.    <P>
According to some jihadists in Tunisia, <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> is currently also detaining Sharia judge Abu Musaab Al-Tunisi, who previously proclaimed several Taliban heads, and former leader of Al-Qaeda Osama <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> as kafirs.    <P>
Some Hazimis have criticised Boko Haram leader Abu Bakr Shekau for pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. They say that Shekau does not adopt the principle of the excuse of ignorance and, unlike <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a>, Shekau does not cast doubt that those who take part in elections are kafirs. The Hazimis warned that Shekau is deviating from what they believe to be the approach of pure tawhid.    <P>
In December, the security apparatus of IS detained a cell of Chechen fighters for plotting a coup against IS on the grounds that they are kafir for taking zakat from the Syrian people, who are mushriks.</blockquote>    <P>
