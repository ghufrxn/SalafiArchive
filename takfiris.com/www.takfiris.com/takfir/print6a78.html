<p><div class='sidebar'>The da'wah (call) of contemporary movements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> is founded upon a premise that was first written about by <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and this premise is that all Muslim nations and societies have been non-existent for centuries and that all the people therein, rulers, ruled, imaams, mu'adhdhins, men and women are all apostates because they live under these rulers out of satisfaction and acceptance. This basic assumption then justifies and drives [in one of the two strains of Ikhwani methodology] the practical approach of creating dissent, unrest, <a href='tags/rebellion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rebellion</font></a> and armed revolution in order to replace the authority with a new Islamic one led by the revolutionary vanguards. Straight out of Lenin's manifesto, <a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>Qutbiyyah, say 'thank you' to Lenin</a> (for importing his concepts and approaches to give you your methodology of claimed reform), just as the Ash'arites and the Ahl al-Kalaam in general ought to say 'thank you' to Aristotle (for the use of his conceptual tools to give them their theological methodology).</div>    <P>
For the abovementioned the reason, the issue of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers is a matter that the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> <u>have to protect aggressively</u> (otherwise the entire methodology collapses), and this has formed a large part of the debate between the Scholars upon the way of the Salaf in our time, and those poisoned with the poison of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and his likes. The <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> were not humiliated and slapped into oblivion by anything more than one whom they were greatly attached to (because he he was sympathetic towards their figureheads), that is Shaykh <a href='tags/ibn-jibreen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Jibreen</font></a>, <b>when he spoke regarding the some of the rulers and the <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> (<a href=indexe052.html?eoizx>read it here</a>)</b>, and this statement pretty much destroyed their ship and left it wrecked and in ruins, all but deserted. When these <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> found that none of the Major Scholars of Saudi were with them in the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all of the rulers <u>without exception</u>, they accused them in general of being "revisionists" and turned instead to the ignorant non-Scholars to help them prop up that <a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>Leninist manifesto</a> they were operating upon and which had come to them through Qutb's works. As for the removal of <i>amn</i> (security, safety) from the Muslim lands, partly exemplified in the removal of Shariah rule (and hastened in the era of colonialism) then Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, those upon the way of the Salaf, they have a particular understanding of the causes and their effects in respect to this matter which clashes with the Mu'tazili, Qadari outlook of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, Takfiriyyah and which all the political groups of today are in fact operating upon. This is why the methodologies of reform between Ahl al-Sunnah and that of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, Takfiriyyah, Tahririyyah and all similar groups are at variance and conflict. One is based upon the methodology of the Prophets, founded upon sound reason and revelation, and the other is based upon  a Mu'tazili, Qadari perspective whose methodologies are founded upon secular atheist notions of the rise and fall of nations and governments and of social justice and the likes which came to them from ignorant non-scholars of the 20th century.

Abu Umaamah relates that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said:    <P>

Reported by Ahmad in his Musnad, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami' as-Sagheer (no. 5057) of Shaykh al-Albaanee who declared it <b>Saheeh</b>.     <P>
And Shaykh Abdul-Azeez bin Baz (rahimahullaah) commented, upon the previous hadeeth (as occurs in Majmoo' ul-Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Mutanawwi'ah):    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the meaning of his saying in the hadeeth: "<b>The first of them to be anulled is the rule (<a href='tags/al-hukm.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Hukm</font></a>)</b>", its meaning is apparent, and it is the absence of ruling by the legislation of Allaah, and this is what is present today in most of the states ascribing to Islaam. And it is known that what is obligatory upon all is to judge by the Sharee'ah of Allaah in all things and to beware of judging by the <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a>, and the customs that oppose the pure legislation.</blockquote>    <P>
In the above hadith is a refutation of the contemporary <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a> in that the Prophet (alayhis salaam) has explicitly stated that the first of the handholds of Islam to be broken is that of <a href='tags/al-hukm.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Hukm</font></a> (rule) which means the absence of complete rule by the Shari'ah. Upon the principles of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> who makes <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of any departure from the Shari'ah and claims that faith is only valid in the presence of 100% Shari'ah rule over the subjects, it means that the Muslim Ummah for a very long time, more than just a few hundred years, has ceased to exist. In fact, it is what <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> explicitly states in "Maaalim fit-Tareeq" (p.8, 17th edition, 1991):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Ummah (of Islaam) has ceased to be in existence (ghaabat al-Ummah) and has not been perceivable for a very long time. </blockquote>    <P>
And he was followed in this by the <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Khawarij</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> (<a href=indexa0d3.html?aorjc>see here</a> and <a href=index9964.html?qyrnf>also here</a>), who followed the Ash'arites of Egypt in working towards an ideological and physical revolution to destabilize and undermine the land of Tawhid (where to this day, grave-worship is not to be found, unlike in Egypt, even if sins and disobedience are found therein like in all other places). The intent here is to show that if these people were truthful in their claim and in their underlying premise(s) (they took from Sayyid Qutb), they would have to essentially make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the entire Ummah from pretty much after the first thirty years of the rule of the Righteous Caliphs, when shortcomings began to appear and 100% rule of the Shariah was not established, especially considering that many of these groups consider kingship to be haraam (unlawful) in Islaam.    <P>
