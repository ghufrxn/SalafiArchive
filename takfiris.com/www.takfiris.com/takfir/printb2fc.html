We have documented extensively with proofs in other places that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> was "<u>gulping</u>" down the <u>Western materialist (secular atheistic) philosophies</u> for 15 years of his life between 1925 and 1940 (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?edera>see here</a>); that when he started turning to Islam, this past nurturing affected his ideology and doctrine; that a major influence upon him was <b>Marxist-Socialism</b>; that he considered Islam to be made up in part of Communism (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?jevki>see here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?bguiq>also here</a>); that on the basis of a Communist perspective of "<i>Social Justice</i>" and a [Communist] critique of Capitalism (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?oyama>see here</a>), <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> reviled and attacked Uthmaan, Mu'awiyah, Amr bin al-Aas (radiallaahu anhum) and negated Islam from Bani Umayyah (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/series/sayyid-qutb-and-the-aqidah-of-the-rafidah-in-reviling-and-abusing-the-companions.cfm>see this series</a>), continuing to publish his attacks upon Uthman and Bani Umayyah right until his death; that he launched a Socialist revolution in 1952 along with the Free Officers, helping Jamal Abdul-Nasser coming to power as a result, (this revolution being planned in Qutb's own house); that despite being refuted by Shaykh Mahmood Shakir in 1952 for his attacks upon the Companions he persisted upon displaying the <u>Communist-Marxist-Socialist ideologically motivated attacks</u> upon some of the Companions right up until his death (see <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?kjxfr>here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?fhmqo>here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?alkbq>here</a>); that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, having already been behind one Leninist type Socialist revolution in 1952, began to pen down the ideology of revolution in the late 1950s, along with the takfiri <i>fikr</i> in the late 1950s and early 1960s in his works <i>az-Zilal</i> and <i>Milestones</i> (a Leninist Manifesto for Muslims) - <a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>see this article</a>.    <P>

<img src=assets/images/khalidee-qutb-cover.gif align=right border=1 vspace=8 hspace=6 border=0>The realities can be arrived at by looking at what Salaah al-Khaalidee has written in his book (<span class='arb'>&#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1604;&#1575;&#1583; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1578;&#1588;&#1607;&#1575;&#1583;</span>) "From Birth to Martyrdom" a biography of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (pp. 213-215) regarding the period of "wastage" in Qutb's life. Note that this biography is one written in a favorable light and so it is not an adverse source of information. This is a second edition print from 1994CE.    <P>
In this entire section spanning forty or so pages Khaalidee discusses the period of doubt and confusion that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> went through for 15 years of his life until the 1940s, and in which he (anda his mentor of the time Abbaas al-Aqqaad, poet, writer, philosopher, existentialist) simply "<i>gulped down</i>" (Khaalidee's expression) the materialist philosophies of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?edera>Please refer to the complete article here</a>.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Muslim and non-Muslim Commentators on Qutb's <a href="tags/leninism.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Leninism</font></a></font>    <P>
In the compilation, "Islam and the West, Critical Perspectives on  Modernity" (compiled by Michael Thompson), Omer Caha writes (pp. 44-45), in what is an excellent and extremely accurate  and astute observation:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Radical and revolutionary Islam, which emerged as reactions to colonialism, were inspired more by socialist values than by liberal democratic values, and they formulated their principles in line with this outlook. It was common in the Islamic world until the 1980s to consider Islam as a source of ideology as well as a revolutionary ideology. It was particularly the Iranian revolution, which became and inspirational reference for Islamic movements at that time. In this period, Islam was taken by Muslim thinkers of Iranian origin as well as by those of North African origin, almost as a kind of state religion, a revolutionary ideology, and a theocratic political structure.    <P>
Such interpretations of Islam can be traced back, in the case of some North African countries, to the period between the second half of the nineteenth century and up to the first half of the twentieth century. At that point in time, Muslim countries began to suffer a long period of painful setback in the face of the incredible economic growth and development western countries were experiencing. <b>Moreover, the colonial ambitions of western countries directly over Islamic territories evoked strong reactions from Muslim thinkers of North Africa who began to think in terms of <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a>. This explains a great deal about the distance, which Muslims began to feel toward liberalism, democracy, capitalism,and other similar systems and ideas.</b>    <P>
<b>The two key concepts these thinkers borrowed from <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a> were the "state" and "revolution". It was in their view, the state that symolized social justice, social unity, and the struggle against the West. Such a state could only be established through revolution, this being under the leadership of a pioneering group. </b>    <P>
The works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, an Egyptian Islamic intellectual who was hanged by the Nasser regime in 1966, for instance, emphasize the role of a revolutionary group. <b>Largely on account of his Leninist background, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> envisaged the establishment of an Islamic state by means of a revolution led by a specially trained group versed in Islamic values. The project towards the creation of such a group, indeed, can be seen as an attempt to replace Lenin's proletariat vanguards with their Muslim counterparts.</b> For <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, the salvation of Muslims, as well as the entirety of humanity depended on an Islamic state that would represent a third way, i.e., an alternative to socialism and capitalism.     <P>
Although critical of socialism, many Islamic intellectuals, as in the case of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, operated on values that might be combined with a Leninist style of state socialism in some form through its emphasis on collective brotherhood, revolution, equality, salvation, a centralized state, anticapitalism, and antidemocracy amongst others.    <P>
Hence, both authoritarian regimes and Muslim intellectuals with a first-hand experience of colonial domination completely refused the West, and sought to set up alternative institutions, which were authoritarian in character. <b>When realizing the traditional interpretations of Islam fell short of enabling the deployment of adequate means by which to resolve existing problems, they began to borrow concepts and perspectives from Russian socialism</b>, which was anticapitalist and antiliberalist in character...</blockquote>    <P>
Thought the writer is writing from the perspective of explaining the lack of democracy, or opposition to democracy in the Muslim lands, his analysis of the origins of ideologies based upon the notions of "state" and "revolution" and borrowed from Russian Bolshevism are extremely accurate. This can be seen in the likes of Abu A'la Mawdudi and very  clearly in the writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>.    <P>
Phil Paine, a writer and independent scholar as he describes himself observes, after reading Milestones for the first time:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... The first thing one notices about Qutb's ideological thought is how little it has to do with traditions of Islam, or the needs of people in Islamic countries. <b> It is profoundly European in inspiration, and it's chief models are Hitler, Marx and Lenin ...  Lenin is by far the strongest influence</b>.      <P>
<b>Whole passages look like they were simply copied out from his works and then a pseudo-Islamic terminology inserted, "<a href="tags/revolutionary-vanguard.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Revolutionary Vanguard</font></a>" becoming "Islamic vanguard",  and so on</b>...   As Marxist mumbo-jumbo justified the telling of any lie, the betrayal of any value,  the commitment of any atrocity,  in the name of an implacable destiny, so too, does Milestones...     <P>
... <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was by no means alone.  In the 1920's and 1930's, the Muslim Brotherhood and other precursers of today's jihadist movement were profoundly influenced by Marxism and Nazism.  Before WWII, Hitler was the greater influence, but with his defeat, Communism became the principal inspiration.  In fact, <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> himself was a delegate to the Communist International, its principle liaison with the Muslim Brotherhood. [R. R. Reilly, "The Roots of Islamist Ideology"]    <P>
... <b>Qutb draws on the Asharite tradition, as well as on his Marxist and Nazi sources</b>. But today's totalitarian Islamism is not an attempt to restore the glories of early Islam.  Far from it --- it draws its inspiration from the deviations from classical Islam that destroyed those glories...</blockquote>    <P>
It is very interesting to see how individuals that are learned, well-read and well-versed can immediately recognize - after reading just a single book (Milestones) - the true and real origins of Qutb's ideology. The writer also had the knowledge and understanding to recognize Qutb's Asharite leanings. So  much for those ignoramus journalists and half-boiled writers linking <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> to Salafiyyah. As for "Marxist" sources, then <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was formerly a communist and some of his communist ideology comes through still in his writings such as advocating the confiscation and redistribution of wealth (that will be dealt with in a separate article). As for "Nazi" sources, then we do not know of any credible evidence at this point in time to suggest he had "Nazi" sources for his ideologies.     <P>
Ladan and Roya Boroumand wrote in an article titled "Terror, Islam and Democracy", Journal of Democracy 13.2 (2002) 5-20:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Like Mawdudi and various Western totalitarians, he [Qutb] identified his own society (in his case, contemporary Muslim polities) as among the enemies <u>that a virtuous, ideologically self-conscious, vanguard minority would have to fight by any means necessary, including violent revolution, so that a new and perfectly just society might arise</u>. His ideal society was a classless one where the "selfish individual" of liberal democracies would be banished and the "exploitation of man by man" would be abolished. God alone would govern it through the implementation of Islamic law (shari'a). <b>This was <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a> in Islamist dress</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Contemporary members of the Muslim Brotherhood acknowledge that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> was influenced by Leninist revolutionary methodology. Ibrahim al-Houdaiby writes in an article "Four Decades After Sayyid Qutb's Execution" (bold emphasis is ours):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In "Milestones" <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> presents a manifesto for change, <b>one heavily influenced by Lenin's "What is to be done," with the clear Islamization of its basic notions</b>. He argued that society was suffering from "jahiliyya" (a state of ignorance which preceded the revelation of Islam) and that consequently, there is no room for middle ground between Islamists and their societies.</blockquote>    <P>
Paul Berman writes in an article published in the New York Times, 23rd March 2003:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The few had to gather themselves together into what <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> in "Milestones" called <u>a vanguard</u> - <b>a term that he must have borrowed from Lenin</b> ...</blockquote>    <P>
In "Sayyid Qutb: The Father of Al-Qaida", published in the Independent in August 2006, Daniel  Martin quotes from Lawrence Wright observing about the book "Milestones":    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...Its ringing apocalyptic tone may be compared with Rousseau's "Social Contract" and <b>Lenin's "What Is to Be Done?"</b> - with similar bloody consequences.</blockquote>    <P>
Rod Dreher writes in the Dallas Morning News (27th August 2006):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> What is to be done? Lenin famously asked about Czarist Russia. Qutb's answer to the same question about the West was, in part, "Milestones," <b>a Leninist-style tract advocating worldwide Islamic revolution</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
As we have noted in a previous article that:    <P>
The esteemed scholar, Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee, who has authored numerous works in refutation of the heresies and extremism of the father of all modern takfiri groups, pointed out in 1995 Qutb's exposition of elements of Communist ideology as well as his Leninist revolutionary activities.    <P>
Shaikh Rabee' stated in "al-Awaasim Mimmaa Fee Kutub <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Min al-Qawaasim" (p.38, 1st print, 1995):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Secondly: This tashree (legislation) that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> ascribes to Islaam (referring here to some aspects of socialism-marxism related to confiscation of wealth from the rich for redistribution amongst the poor that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> permitted), he borrowed them from the Communist and Western principles (mabaadi) and theorems (nadhariyyaat) which had become widespread in his lifetime. In fact he himself used to imbibe (such principles and theorems) and they remained settled in his soul and in his intellect at the time when he would write in the name of Islaam. Especially when he mounted the peak of the Nasserite Taaghootee Revolution which in its application, centered around Socialism, based upon the theorem of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and his likes, those who had mixed Marxist Socialism with the garment of Islaam, and by which Islaam and the Muslims were pounded.</blockquote>     <P>
And in the footnote, the Shaikh adds to this:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And the Free Officers, at the head of them, Jamaal Abd an-Nasser, used to be students, learning from the books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and he (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) used to partner with them in plotting the revolution. Refer to the book "Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> min al-Meelaad Ilaa Istish.haad" (p.299-304) and before these pages, and also the book "Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> al-Adeeb an-Naaqid" (p.105-107)." </blockquote>    <P>
Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> based his ideologies on his own Socialist, Marxist, Leninist background. He had already been involved in one Leninist-style revolution when he along with Nasser and the Free Officers plotted the revolution by which Nasser came into power - though he and Nasser later fell out.     <P>
The fact that <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> was heavily influenced by Marxist Socialism and <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a> is being firmly established as more and more academic studies are conducted looking at the evolution of Qutb's writings and ideologies in the background of the changing social, economical and political landscapes in the time that <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> lived (early to mid 20th century).    <P>
As all contemporary takfiri and jihadi groups who promote revolution as a means of reform have inevitably taken their methodologies from <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, they can rightly be called Leninist-Kharijites or Leninist-Takfiris, as <u>the real and actual intellectual basis</u> of their ideologies and methodologies has been thoroughly exposed. <b>Marxist-Socialism</b> and <b><a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a></b>. <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> could not find the revolution he envisaged in the Qur'an, or the Sunnah or from any of the Orthodox Muslim scholars. In fact the above author has shrewdly pointed this out:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When realizing the traditional interpretations of Islam fell short of enabling the deployment of adequate means by which to resolve existing problems, they began to borrow concepts and perspectives from Russian socialism...</blockquote>    <P>
So instead, he took it from Lenin, and then tried to quote from historical and prominent scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah to argue for aspects of his methodology. As we will show in future articles, Qutb's use of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) to argue for his Leninist methodology is false, as Ibn Taymiyyah is the greatest of people in prohibiting revolution and rebelling against the authorities.    <P>
