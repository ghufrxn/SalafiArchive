<font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding <a href="tags/ali-al-timimi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ali al-Timimi</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=index938a.html?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=index13c7.html?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>) are boasting these days that <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" aqidah to the youth in the United Kingdom in the early 90s. This was when he had not fully transitioned to the da'wah of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and in those days he did speak a lot of truth, even if influences of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> were clearly manifest in some of his speech even at that time. What destroyed <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was a number of factors, the  most important of them being firstly his attachments to and infatuation with Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq, the Egyptian, through which he eventually got poisoned and overtaken by Qutb's exaggerated doctrines of <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a>. And secondly his long standing commitments towards the Innovators of IANA and his associations with <a href='tags/salaah-as-saawee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salaah as-Saawee</font></a> and other unsavouries amongst the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>. Signs of this affectation could be seen in the early 90s but it wasn't till after the mid-90s that his affair became manifest, and unfortunately it deteriorated from that point onwards after he turned his back upon many of the usool he was previously "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" to others before the mid-90s, and took a portion of the youth towards the Ikhwani methodologies of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and his likes. This shows that guidance is in Allaah's hands and having plenty of knowledge and understanding of issues does not actually equate to <i>guidance</i> in and of itself. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Ali al-Timimi on the <a href='tags/saudi-government.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Government</font></a>, Tyranny, and Means of Rectification of the Rulers</font>    <P>
In this audio recording from prior to the mid 90s, <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> is asked regarding Shaykh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz and the <a href='tags/gulf-war.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Gulf War</font></a>, and he clarifies a presumption made in the question(s) posed. Listen to it below.    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/assets/audio/timimi-bin-baz-saudi-islamic-government.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
<b>Download the audio file:</b><BR>  <a href=assets/audio/timimi-takfir-saudi-government.mp3>Download the MP3 file from here</a>.    <P>
In this audio:     <P>
<ul><li> He speaks about the danger of speaking ill of the Scholars.    <P>
<li>He mentions that the statement (in the question) that the <a href='tags/saudi-government.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Government</font></a> is a "non-Islamic" government means it is a kaafir government, and that this is incorrect. Rather it is an Islamic government and the rulers uphold the Sharee'ah.    <P>
<li> As for what they do which is incorrect it is for the Scholars to give them naseehah (advice) and for the Muslims to pray for their righteousness.    <P>
<li> Any suffering that the Muslims incur from the rulers is a result of the sins of the Muslims and he mentions the story of when Alee (radiallaahu anhu) was asked about why there was lots of civil strife in his time compared to the time of Abu Bakr (radiallaahu anhu), to which he replied that in the time of Abu Bakr and Umar, they were ruling over men and in this time, I am ruling over the likes of you.    <P>
<li> The loss of the righteousness of a society or a government is a reflection of that society itself and the rulers come from that society, not from another planet. It is the sinfulness and disobedience amongst the people that leads to their oppression and tyranny.    <P>
<li> That the way to rectify this situation is not merely to attack the rulers, but rather by rectifying the society, changing the people.    <P>
<li> He means that many callers who come out calling for ruling by the Sharee'ah themselves have aspects of <a href='tags/secularism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secularism</font></a> with them (he is referring to the Ikhwaanis who allow working through <a href='tags/secularism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secularism</font></a> as a means of arriving at the rule of Allaah!)  </ul>    <P>
Unfortunately, <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> turned back from much of this, and began to show hatred and resentment towards those who remained upon what the Scholars were upon in regard to the issues above and he was put to trial mainly through Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> who continued to raise the banners of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Hassan al-Banna through his works, splitting the da'wah in every place through his so-called "Scientific Salafiyyah" and large amounts of wealth.    <P>
Whilst warning against the Qutbo-Leninist ideology in the early 90s, al-Timimi then came half-circle and began to propagandize for the very books and very individuals whose ideologies he was saying "<i>is obligatory to warn against</i>", and we shall document this in a separate article inshaa'Allaah. Then after the mid-90s al-Timimi found followers amongst the ignoramuses who became mesmerized through his speech and had little knowledge of what al-Timimi was upon in the earlier period, thinking that those who were pointing out al-Timimi's errors had departed from the beaten track, when it was in fact <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> who departed from the beaten track, and had taken up <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> - which all the Scholars had warned against by the turn of the next century - including Imaam al-Albaani, Imaam Ibn Baaz, Imaam Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan and others - see <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?xwcmm>here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?sxptl>here</a> for proof from Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen and Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan and statements from other scholars will be presented in due course.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>The book that sunk their ship was "<i>Baraa'a Ulamaa il-Ummah</i>" and you can <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/?oplui>read about it here</a> with a serialization of its contents <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/series/the-sayings-verdicts-and-rulings-of-the-scholars-of-ahl-us-sunnah-regarding-the-doctrines-and-books-of-sayyid-qutb.cfm>in this section here</a></b>.</div>    <P>
We ask Allaah to guide these people back to the truth and for them to recognize the great evil that these methodologies unleashed upon the Ummah, the greatest example of that being Algeria in the 1990s in which the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> deceived the Algerian people, lied upon the Major Scholars, and gave advice that led many to their unneeded deaths. That wicked and evil scandal deserves to be covered in detail so all people can see the great evil of these people and in these revolutionary ideologies they became affected by whose origins lie with secular atheist Jews.    <P>
   <P>
