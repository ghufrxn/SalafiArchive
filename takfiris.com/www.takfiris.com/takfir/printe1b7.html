<p><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan was asked:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Is it correct to apply the label of "<a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a>" to those who do bombings in our country. And who shall we respond to those who refrain from applying the label of "<a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a>" to them? And is the group of the Muslim Brotherhood and its leadership the origin of these ones (the Kharijites)? </blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh answered:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The origin of the beginnings of this faction is from the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> (of old). However, their evil (the contemporary ones) increased and they surpassed what was done by the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. For the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> (of old) did not used to raze houses (to the ground) adn blow up residential and commercial buildings. They did not use to perform these actions. They <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> used to appear in battles and fight, they did not used to attack the houses of people living in securely and terrify women and children. So these (contemporary) ones are more evil than the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> (of old). They are more in resemblance to the Qaraamitah and the Secret Orders. Hence, the origin of their ideology is the ideology of the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>, but then their affair evolved until they added (affairs) on top of what the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> did. So they are more evil than them. It is not permissible to refrain from applying the label of 'Kharijites' to them, because they are <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> in reality and in their origin, rather, they are more evil than them as we have mentioned.</blockquote>    <P>
