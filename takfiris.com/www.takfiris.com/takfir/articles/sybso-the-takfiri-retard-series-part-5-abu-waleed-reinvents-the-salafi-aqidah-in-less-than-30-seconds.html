<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The 20th century <a href='../tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> are a by-product of the Marxist, Socialist, Leninist ideologies that were distilling in the minds of individuals like <a href='../tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="../tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=../indexb2fc.html?qyowp>see here</a>) and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?rzaoo>see here</a>). Taking the concept of revolution (ideological and physical) as a means of establishing social justice was a theme incorporated into the writings of ignorant 20th century thinkers, the  most prominent amongst them being Hassan al-Banna, Abu Alaa Mawdudi, <a href='../tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="../tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani. This created the framework that gave birth to the Kharijite ideology of <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='../tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a>. These are the true and real origins of the <a href='../tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> of the 20th century. However, over the decades, and as the Salafi scholars exposed them, their figureheads and their doctrines, they have attempted to resemble the Salafis more and more as a means of veiling their falsehood.    <P>
It is authentically narrated from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that the <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> are (<span class='arb'>&#1587;&#1601;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;</span>) which can be loosely translated as "foolish-minded." The earlier and first <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> were of course in a much better situation than the contemporary <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> because the contemporaries do not consider lying to be a great deal whereas the <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old, out of their exaggerated piety, wrongly believed it would make them disbelievers and feared it a great deal. On this count and many others, there is no comparison between the earlier and modern <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. There are remnants of the followers of <a href='../tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> who have resorted to various labels after the Muslims became aware of their group and its devious methodology, and over the past few years they have hijacked the Salafi label, wrongly thinking it will veil their bid'ah and dalaalah which they procaim openly. They cannot name a single Salafi scholar who is upon their way in this time and this is because they have no scholars, they only have the likes of Abu Hamzah al-Misree (who has recently revealed his <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>connections and dealings</a> with MI5 in his court case in the US as part of his defence argument!) - and those like him from the straying ignoramuses. In the UK, such foolish-minded youths are operating under the label of <b>(so-called) Salafi Media UK</b>, and we will look at some of their main speakers in thi series.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The word retard in its dictionary meaning that is being used here, refers to "<i>a foolish person</i>", one who is "<i>stupid, ineffective</i>" and is similar to the word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) in Arabic, which means, "<i>stupid, ignorant, silly</i>" and what is similar to that. Use of word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) can be found in the speech of some of the Scholars to refer to disparaged individuals deserving of the label.  </blockquote></div> <P> 
<div class="articleContent">
<font class='titleHeadline'>Disclaimer</font>    <P>
Before we continue it is important to make the following disclaimer: There often arise unique situations in which we are forced to address specific individuals from the people of falsehood in a specific way so that they are appropriately and justly <u>put into their proper place</u>. This may involve the use of certain language. This is by no means a general rule and it should not be taken as a license to take this as a general approach with those who are upon falsehood, be they the ignorant common-folk or even those at a higher level than them. In the case of the individual being discussed in this article (and some of his associates to be discussed in later parts) - after reflection from numerous angles and consultation with others - it has been decided to follow the example of some of the Scholars of the past (and present) who do not feel shy in using language that might seem offensive (<i>dogs</i>, <i>donkeys</i>, <i>idiots</i>, <i>apes</i> etc.), yet befitting for the one being spoken of in light of the circumstances. Just a quick example, Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab said (<i>Durar as-Sunniyah 1/77-78</i>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>So if that is the case concerning the one who held belief in Eesaa Ibn Maryam, and yet he is a prophet amongst the Prophets, and he invoked him and sought rescue from him, that he disbelieves, how about those who believe in the Shaytaans, such as that dog, Abu Hudaydah, and Uthmaan who is in al-Waadee, and other dogs in al-Kharaj, and those besides them in all the other lands</blockquote>    <P>
And in the poetry of Abu Tahir al-Silafi (d. 576H), he describes many of the heads of innovation with labels such as "<b>dogs</b>", "<b>asses</b>", "<b>apes</b>" who "<i>deserve humiliation</i>." Since we will be dealing with new heights and levels of stupidity in this article it is important to ensure our terminology is up to the job of addressing such levels (of stupidity) for the sake of accuracy. For this reason, it is important we get definitions out of the way as well so that you can enjoy a <u>hassle-free</u> reading experience. Once more, we emphasize, that this type of approach is taken rarely, only due to circumstances requiring that, and is not to be generalized. Most people are not evil cretins like <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a>, even if they are misguided, so they are to be given da'wah in ways which are best. Also, it is important that these people are spoken about because journalists, enemies to Ahl al-Sunnah, and academic writers (in journals) will consider and perceive these people as representing Salafis and Salafiyyah. As much as we hate wasting time with these people, it is necessary for certain objectives whose importance and significance go way beyond the retards being discussed.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Definitions: Cretin</font>    <P>
The meaning of the word <i>retard</i> has already preceded. The word <i>cretin</i>, in one of its <u>linguistic</u> dictionary meanings (<span class='arb'>&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;&#1611;</span>) is:    <P>
<ul><li><b>Oxford:</b> a stupid person,   <li><b>Collins:</b> a person considered to be extremely stupid  <li><b>Webster:</b> a very stupid or foolish person  <li><b>MacMillan:</b> a very stupid person</ul>    <P>
However, there are times when standard dictionary meanings do not suffice and we need to go to a <u>conventional</u> meaning (<span class='arb'>&#1575;&#1589;&#1591;&#1604;&#1575;&#1581;&#1575;&#1611;</span>) to do justice to the situation. For this reason we are going to present a <b>revised <u>urban</u> usage</b> of the word:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Cretin</b>: (cre-tin) a person that is: brainless, stupid, child-like, and full of pointless information that makes no sense and appeals only to other cretins. They can be found in abundance in online social media platforms, where they race to post as many mind-numbing messages, tweets or videos as possible, and in which coherence and sense are rarely found. </blockquote>    <P>
Now that we have the disclaimer out of the way and our terms defined appropriately we can now move into the body of the article.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Takfiri Cretin Feigning Salafiyyah Rewrites the Doctrine of al-Qadar in 30 Seconds Flat</font>    <P>
The reader should note that <b>the Takfiri cretin</b> below is one who creates pictures of the Salafi scholars and the rulers (particularly of Saudi) wearing their shimaaghs but replacing their faces with those of dogs or monkeys. He makes <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the Salafi scholars and and he makes <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of the rulers without exception.     <P>
<img src=../assets/images/salafimediatakfirposter.jpg border=0> <img src=../assets/images/salafimediatakfirposter2.jpg border=0>    <P>
From what follows, you will learn that this individual is an ignoramus pretender, that he is an embarassment and shame upon the <a href='../tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old (they are much better than that), and that he is also a person with self-amazement whom Shaytan has misguided. He is a fraud on top of that, out to deceive people by telling them lies about the deen of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic by pretending he has knowledge.     <P>
<img src=../assets/images/retarded-takfiri-abuwaleed-qadar.png width="525" border=0>    <P>
Abu Waleed (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK") says (<a href=../assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-qadar.mp3>mp3</a>):    <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="../mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="../mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/assets/audio/retard-abuwaleed-qadar.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
Here is a transcript of his words, it is one minute long and special attention should be given to the last 30 seconds (from <b>{5}</b> onwards). We have numbered the passage for easy reference later in the article:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>{1}</b> When the reality is that in the Divine Tablet has already been recorded everything that's going to happen until Yawm ul-Qiyaamah. <b>{2}</b> If we understand the topic of al-qadar wal-qadaa we understand that the knowledge of Allaah Azzawajall precedes everyone else's knowledge and Allaah Azzawajall has knowledge of everything that is going to happen. <b>{3}</b> He ordered the pen to write. And then the pen asked Allaah Azzawajall, "What shall I write?" <b>{4}</b> He mentioned a number of things, mentioned about his birth, about his rizq, about his life, about his death. All of this has been recorded. <b>{5}</b> However Allaah Azzawajall has given us the free will and the iraadah to do the actions. <b>{6}</b> Where people deviated in the past was, they said "Our actions have been created, so what can I do?" So they attribute sin to Allaah, so if they done the sin, they committed the sin, they say Allaah Azzawajall is the one who, He said I was going to do this. He committed the sin for me. Aoodhubillah. <b>{7}</b> The extreme Qaadiriyyah who Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam) he said, "They are the Majoos of my Ummah" they are like the fire-worshippers of my ummah, foretold this in fact, inside the hadeeth. </blockquote>    <P>
Before we continue, let us quote what we said at the end of the previous article in this series (<a href=../index973d.html?oqicq>see here</a>) about these people: "<i>They are walking, talking refutations of themselves. The only thing we have done here is to draw people's attention to this fact</i>." No doubt, when a person feigns Salafiyyah and fraudulently wears its gown, it is inevitable that sooner or later, he will be standing in public with his gown removed, just like <b>the Naked Emperor</b>, and as soon as notification is made and fingers are pointed to his nakedness, all people will start laughing and mocking his stupidity. Here we have a perfect example. So sit back and let us go through this in slow-motion:    <P>
<b>ONE:</b> The Takfiri cretin starts his rant with a few sentences that are sound.  Up to and including passage <b>{2}</b> everything is fine and <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> is on a roll. You see cretins are not 100% stupid. They are misled by the little  knowledge they have picked up. Deluded by this little knowledge, they speak and act whilst oblivious to the cretinous speech (and action) arising from them due to the false self-reassurance which that little knowledge has given them. <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> thinks he has understood the topic of al-Qadar. Worse still, it may be the case that he may just have been deliberately lying, making things up as he goes along in order to impress his audience.     <P>
<b>TWO:</b> The sentence in <b>{3}</b> is also sound. But things started sliding downhill from here... and this is where Abu Waleed's invisible garments of knowledge start to expose the cretin that lies beneath them. In passage <b>{4}</b> he states, "...<i>He mentioned a number of things, mentioned about his birth, about his rizq, about his life, about his death...</i>" and what he has done here is to mix up two separate hadeeths. He has merged the hadeeth of the Pen and the writing of the decrees <b><u>prior</u></b> to creation with the hadeeth of the Angel that is commanded to write four things when the fetus is in the womb. In the hadeeth of the Pen, the Pen is commanded by Allaah to write "<i>Whatever is to take place until the Day of Judgement</i>." Al-Albani authenticates the hadeeth in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (no. 133, 1/257) with the wording (<span class='arb'>&#1573;&#1606; &#1571;&#1608;&#1604; &#1588;&#1610;&#1569; &#1582;&#1604;&#1602;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1578;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1604;&#1605; &#1608;&#1571;&#1605;&#1585;&#1607; &#1571;&#1606; &#1610;&#1603;&#1578;&#1576; &#1603;&#1604; &#1588;&#1610;&#1569; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606;</span>). However, this is not really the worst of Abu Waleed's cretinous action. That comes shortly.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> Sentence <b>{5}</b> is also a sound statement, that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has given us a free will to choose our actions, and proof of this is abundant in the Quran, by way of example (<span class='arb'>&#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614; &#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1578;&#1614;&#1584;&#1618;&#1603;&#1616;&#1585;&#1614;&#1577;&#1612; &#1601;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1606; &#1588;&#1614;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1578;&#1617;&#1614;&#1582;&#1614;&#1584;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1587;&#1614;&#1576;&#1616;&#1610;&#1604;&#1611;&#1575;</span>), "<b>Verily! This is an admonition, so whosoever wills, let him take a Path to his Lord</b>"  (76:29). This will however is under the will of Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
<b>FOUR:</b> It is in the next 30 seconds that <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> rewrites the understanding of al-Qadar for us. Let us cite parts <b>{6}</b> to <b>{7}</b>:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>{6}</b> Where people deviated in the past was, they said "Our actions have been created, so what can I do?" So they attribute sin to Allaah, so if they done the sin, they committed the sin, they say Allaah Azzawajall is the one who, He said I was going to do this. He committed the sin for me. Aoodhubillah. <b>{7}</b> The extreme Qaadiriyyah who Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam) he said, "They are the Majoos of my Ummah" they are like the fire-worshippers of my ummah, foretold this in fact, inside the hadeeth. </blockquote>    <P>
Allaahu Akbar! What a cretin (<span class='arb'>&#1571;&#1581;&#1605;&#1602;, &#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>)! The likes of this one makes <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of scholars and rulers and whole governments and passes judgements of kufr upon societies, nations and lands?! One who cannot distinguish between the <b>Q<u>aa</u>diriyyah</b> which is a Sufi tariqah and the <b>Qadariyyah</b> who are the deniers of al-Qadar?! And one who ascribes to the Qadariyyah the very opposite of their doctrine!! In case you may not have picked up on all the cretinous elements found in the above passage, let us elaborate in some detail.     <P>
<b>FIVE:</b> First of all,  let us lay the groundwork by explaining the different groups of the Qadariyyah as explained the Salaf and the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, past and present. Summarizing the matter, the Qadariyyah are of three types:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Majoosiyyah:</b> They are the ones who reject al-qadaa wal-qadar, even though they believe in the command and prohibition (al-amr wal-nahi). There are two groups amongst them, the extremists who deny Allaah's prior knowledge of events (al-ilm al-saabiq) and the writing (kitaabah), and then the moderate ones amongst them who deny only His will and creation - and these are the <b>Mu'tazilah</b> and whoever agreed with them. So pay attention that the ones referred to as "Majoos" by the Messenger of Allaah, they are the ones who denied Allaah creates the actions of the servants, since they denied Allaah's will and act of creation in relation to the actions of the servants. <b>As a result, they effectively said that man creates his own actions, implying that man is a creator of something outside the domain of Allaah's will and creative power</b>. Hence, they were likened to the Magian fire-worshippers who believe in a god of good (who creates good) and a god of evil (who creates evil). This faction affirms Allaah's power (qudrah) over the creation and the entities therein generally, but not over man's <i>actions</i> specifically.     <P>
<li> <b>Mushrikiyyah:</b> The second group are the ones who affirmed al-Qadaa wal-Qadar but they rejected the command and prohibition (al-amr wal-nahi). <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> clearly does not intend this group, because he stated "<i>The extreme Qaadiriyyah who Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam) he said, "They are the Majoos of my Ummah" they are like the fire-worshippers of my ummah</i>..." Hence, there is no escape for him here. The Mushrikiyyah are the ones who argued by way of al-Qadar against al-Shar' (legislation) and they are the ones referred to in (6:148), who said "<b>If Allaah had so willed we and our forefathers would not have committed shirk or made things to be unlawful</b>..." Note that this group does not deny al-Qadar, they affirm, but use it to justify their opposition to the Shar' (legislation).     <P>
<li> <b>Ibleesiyyah:</b>  The third group are those who actually affirm al-qadaa wal-qadar and the command and prohibition (al-amr wal-nahi). However, they consider this to be a contradiction, as in what Allaah wills and decrees contradicts what Allah requests from His servants through command and prohibition. The leader of this group is Iblees himself, who said to Allaah, the Exalted, "...<b>because you have misguided me</b>..." (15:39, 7:16), meaning to say that you commanded me, but then you misguided me (this is a contradiction), so he absolved himself and did not admit to his disobedience and arrogance and claimed a contradiction between qadar (decree) and shar' (legislation) and thus reviled the wisdom (hikmah) and justice (adl) of Allaah, the Exalted.  </ul>    <P>
One can refer to <i>al-Tadmuriyyah</i> of Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and also his <i>al-Qaseedah al-Taa'iyyah</i> with the numerous explanations that can be found for it.     <P>
In addition to the above three groups, we should add here the Jabariyyah, who took the way of al-Jahm bin Safwan, but they are exaggerationists in al-Qadar:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Jabariyyah:</b> They claimed that a servant is compelled upon his statements and actions, claiming that man has no independent power to perform or abandon actions, yet he is still rewarded for what he is compelled to do. They claimed this is Tawheed, in that all actions are from and by Allaah and all power belongs to Him. They thought that by attributing a will and power to man, that this conflicts with Tawheed and enters in the realm of Shirk. In essence, they are at the other end of the spectrum from the Qadariyyah Majoosiyyah mentioned earlier.  </ul>    <P>
Now that <u>the groundwork</u> has been laid down, we are in a better position to see all the cretinous elements in the Takfiri retard's 30-second rant more clearly, so let's do that next:    <P>
<b>SIX:</b> Comments on the 30-second revision of the doctrine of al-Qadar by <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK"), the salafi-pretending fraudster:    <P>
<blockquote><u>Cretin (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>):</u> <b>Where people deviated in the past was, they said "Our actions have been created, so what can I do?"</b> <u>Comment:</u> None of the four groups above deny that the actions of the servants have been created, except <b>the Qadariyyah Majoosiyyah</b> All the rest affirm al-qadaa wal-qadar and that Allaah is the creator of the actions. However, this is the very group (al-Majoosiyyah) to which this retard is attempting to ascribe this saying when their saying is the very opposite of this! <u>Cretin  (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>):</u> <b>So they attribute sin to Allaah, so if they done the sin, they committed the sin, they say Allaah Azzawajall is the one who, He said I was going to do this. He committed the sin for me.</b> <u>Comment:</u> Cloudy thinking here. If we are generous, the consideration in this passage - if we treat it in total isolation from everything else - could be referring to the Qadariyyah Mushrikiyyah (argue by qadar to justify disobedience) or the Jabariyyah (exaggerationists, deny choice and qudrah for man). However, this generosity on our behalf is not allowed because the cretin has made explicit mention of the Qadariyyah Majoosiyyah to whom he ascribes this saying. He thinks this is the saying of the Qadariyyah! <u>Cretin  (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>):</u> <b>The extreme Q<u>aa</u>diriyyah who Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam) he said, "They are the Majoos of my Ummah" they are like the fire-worshippers of my ummah, foretold this in fact, inside the hadeeth. </b> <u>Comment:</u> The Q<u>aa</u>diriyyah are a Sufi order (tariqah), they are different to the Qadariyyah. If we ignore this blunder (not unexpected from salafi-pretending fraudsters like Abu Waleed), then he is ascribing the previous saying (that Allaah creates actions and decreed them upon the servants) to the Qadariyyah Majoosiyyah, the Mu'tazilah. Their saying is that man creates his own actions. But the Takfiri Cretin says (in the view of the Q<u>aa</u>diriyyah) Allaah creates actions of the servants. This is compound ignorance (<i>al-jahl al-murakkab</i>) save that it is too honourable, rather it is <b>compound retardation</b>. (<i>al-ghabaawah al-murakkabah</i>). </blockquote>    <P>
<b>SEVEN:</b> It's only in the world of <a href='../tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a>, the Takfiri cretin, that black equals white and white equals black and Allaah compelling actions on the servants (Jabariyyah) equals man creating his own actions (Qadariyyah Majoosiyyah) and man creating his own actions (Qadariyyah Majoosiiyyah) equals Allaah compelling actions upon him (Jabariyyah). Dear reader, you may or may not be on our side, but just come and have a moment of serious reflection with us: Is the likes of this retard (and dozens like him) to be believed in great and serious matters such as <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of rulers, scholars, governments, societies and the likes?! As much as you may be an opposer to us and our way, I don't seriously think you can answer yes to this one, otherwise you are reminded of the (<span class='arb'>&#1573;&#1589;&#1591;&#1604;&#1575;&#1581;&#1610;</span>) conventional, urban meaning of <i>cretin</i> that has preceded:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Cretin</b>: (cre-tin) a person that is: brainless, stupid, child-like, and full of pointless information that makes no sense and appeals only to other cretins.</blockquote>    <P>
We plea with you not to put yourself under this definition by finding Abu Waleed's speech to be appealing! On this note we conclude this installment in the series along with a reiteration of our previous remark: "<i>They are walking, talking refutations of themselves. The only thing we have done here is to draw people's attention to this fact</i>."   <P>
