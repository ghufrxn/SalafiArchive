<p>Yusuf al-Qardawi is one of the most prominent of the contemporary figureheads of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and he has written many times on the movements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>. We see a couple of trends amongst todays Ikhwanis. Seeing that the ideologies of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> found in Qutb's books are harmful to their cause, a group amongst them (like al-Qaradawi) are trying to distance the Ikhwaan from these teachings. He is opposed by others, who try to downplay the issue of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and argue that the books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> have been fundamental to the Ikhwaani movement, and that they have an important role to play. We'll leave them to argue about these issues, but here is a statement of al-Qaradawi taken from an article published on 4th May 2004 called (<span class='arb'>&#1607;&#1604; &#1610;&#1603;&#1601;&#1617;&#1585; "&#1587;&#1610;&#1583; &#1602;&#1591;&#1576;" &#1605;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1608;&#1605;&#1567;</span>) in which he outlines the ideology of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> in the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>.    <P>

He writes, after quoting a passage from Qutb's commentary az-Zilal (7/269) (<span class='arb'>&#1601;&#1610; &#1592;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606; &#1591;&#1576;&#1593;&#1577; &#1593;&#1610;&#1587;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1604;&#1576;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1579;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#1577;</span>), and he is essentially summarizing the main points from what he quoted from Qutb:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The text is clear, and completely apparent: The writer (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) does not consider [anyone] to be a Muslim except whoever believes in this ideology of his, and this is the group that he calls the "<i>Muslim Vanguard</i>", and this [group] is the one for which it is obligatory to realize that it alone is the "Muslim Ummah", and that whatever is around it and whoever is around it, from those who have not entered into what [this group] has entered into, is [itself] <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a> and [those people are] the people of <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a>, meaning they are Mushriks and Kuffar, they do not have any share of Islaam, even if they pray, fast, give zakah, and make the pilgrimage. It is as if all the Muslims are equivalent to the Mushriks of Makkah at the time of the sending of Muhammad (as a Messenger), and it is as if his da'wah is equivalent to the da'wah of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), whoever believed in that da'wah entered into Islaam and whoever did not believe in it, then he is a Jaahiliyy, Kaafir, whose blood is permissible to shed!!  </blockquote>    <P>
There is no doubt to any sincere Muslim, that this is the deen of the Khawaarij, <u>only it is more severe</u>, more evil and more repugnant, and amazing is the state of a people willing to expend the greatest of efforts in trying to propagandize for this man's works and to defend him and his books in which there is nothing left, after you remove all the aspects of the aqidah of the Jahmiyyah, Mu'tazilah, Ash'ariyyah, Raafidah, except the madhhab of the Khawaarij and the manifestos of secular atheist Jews, such as <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?rhmeq><a href="tags/vladimir-lenin.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Vladimir Lenin</font></a></a>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>This is the same evil methodology we find today. The contemporary followers of this <b>Ash'arite</b> reviver of the deen of the <b>Khawaarij</b> make <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of all Muslim countries, their rulers and governments and then anyone who does not agree with their <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, or their advocated methodology brought to them by <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> from the manifestos of secular atheist Jews, is considered an enemy of Islam and the Muslims. That's the irony of the whole thing. It is these people, upon these doctrines, and their remnants amongst whom the <a href='tags/dajjaal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dajjaal</font></a> (Anti-Christ) will appear (<a href=_a.html href=index9734.html?zyxuc>see here</a>).  These people, in their delusion, think that playing a bit of "<b>cyber-butch</b>" (pronouncing <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, attacking the rulers and scholars in forums and blogs online) amongst their peers is "<i>enjoining the good and forbidding the evil</i>" and "<i>jihad in the path of Allaah</i>". Meanwhile they continue living in the secular lands that they have given preference to and in which they find great ease, comfort and luxury. Not long ago they were claiming that the Maturidi Hanafi Taliban have established <b>the Islamic State</b>! <u>We did not see these people making hijrah over there in hoards and masses</u>.      <P>
Meanwhile, they [appear to] lament over Afghanistan and Iraq, resorting to <a href='tags/secularism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secularism</font></a> and secularist methodologies in their protests and demonstrations and activities. They play and act all "<b>cyber-butch</b>" whilst writing disclaimers on their blogs and forums (with the meaning), "<i>Hey, we free ourselves from what anyone writes on our forums that goes against British and US Laws, and we abide by the British, or US laws (please, please Bush and Blair, please don't throw us in jail for what other people write on our forums, we're sticking to your <a href='tags/qawaaneen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qawaaneen</font></a> and we won't tolerate violation of your <a href='tags/qawaaneen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qawaaneen</font></a> on our forums!)</i>".     <P>
<img src=assets/images/disclaimer-uk-laws.gif border=1 width=500 border=0>    <P>
Ironically on the same blogs and forums these deluded clowns and shysters publicly extol the virtues of speaking the truth in front of a tyrannical ruler. What cowards!  Their forums are based and operate upon secularist principles, they allow every <i>naa'iq</i> (secularist, liberalist, atheist, jahmi, ash'ari, soofee, mu'tazili, aqlaani etc.) a platform, and they institute <a href='tags/qawaaneen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qawaaneen</font></a> for the operation of these forums based upon secular principles, and invite others to implement these <a href='tags/qawaaneen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qawaaneen</font></a>. Their disclaimer above was on their forum for many long years and as soon as this article was posted, they took it down.    <P>
<b>Everything about these people is a lie. Its all hypocrisy. Its a sham and a fraud. And deep inside their souls they know it!</b>    <P>
They come out in the name of caring for the Muslim Ummah, the loftiest of slogans, but it does not concern them that the evil ideologies they are upon played instrumental roles in the murder of tens of thousands of innocent Muslims (take Algeria as an example in the 1990s or Syria in 1982), let alone being a prime factor in the continued justification of the ghazwah of the Muslim lands. Not for one day have these dogs aided Islaam and the Muslims, and nor have they brought any mercy or compassion to the average non-Muslim through any real da'wah to the Tawheed of the Messengers. This is why in the whole of history, never has Allaah allowed the Kharijite dogs, holding such repugnant beliefs, to establish a dawlah, they never had a dawlah, and Allaah willing, they never will - <u>for every time they emerge they will always be cut off</u>, as is stated in the Prophetic Hadeeth about them. And we do not speak about these people except with the language of the revealed texts, and as the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) referred to them as "<i>dogs</i>", then certainly, they are "<i>dogs</i>", and anyone who reflects upon this evil ideology :-      <P>
<blockquote><b>Everyone is a kaafir and so are you unless you believe in my ideology and join me in my secular atheist Leninist methodology to snatch power from the apostates</b> </blockquote>    <P>
...will realize that this is a befitting, Sharee'ah description for them, for there are none more harmful than them in their evil and corruption upon the servant and the land, as has been stated by the likes of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and others. Indeed they are "<b>Kharijite, Terrorist, Dogs of Hellfire</b>" (<a href=index1e1d.html?srjss>see here</a>!)</div> <P>
