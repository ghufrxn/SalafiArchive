<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The 20th century <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> are a by-product of the Marxist, Socialist, Leninist ideologies that were distilling in the minds of individuals like <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> (<a href=indexb2fc.html?qyowp>see here</a>) and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani (<a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?rzaoo>see here</a>). Taking the concept of revolution (ideological and physical) as a means of establishing social justice was a theme incorporated into the writings of ignorant 20th century thinkers, the  most prominent amongst them being Hassan al-Banna, Abu Alaa Mawdudi, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani. This created the framework that gave birth to the Kharijite ideology of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/khurooj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>khurooj</font></a>. These are the true and real origins of the <a href='tags/takfiri-movements.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiri movements</font></a> of the 20th century. However, over the decades, and as the Salafi scholars exposed them, their figureheads and their doctrines, they have attempted to resemble the Salafis more and more as a means of veiling their falsehood.    <P>
It is authentically narrated from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> are (<span class='arb'>&#1587;&#1601;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;</span>) which can be loosely translated as "foolish-minded." The earlier and first <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> were of course in a much better situation than the contemporary <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> because the contemporaries do not consider lying to be a great deal whereas the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> of old, out of their exaggerated piety, wrongly believed it would make them disbelievers and feared it a great deal. On this count and many others, there is no comparison between the earlier and modern <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>. There are remnants of the followers of <a href='tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> who have resorted to various labels after the Muslims became aware of their group and its devious methodology, and over the past few years they have hijacked the Salafi label, wrongly thinking it will veil their bid'ah and dalaalah which they procaim openly. They cannot name a single Salafi scholar who is upon their way in this time and this is because they have no scholars, they only have the likes of Abu Hamzah al-Misree (who has recently revealed his <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=abu+hamza+mI5>connections and dealings</a> with MI5 in his court case in the US as part of his defence argument!) - and those like him from the straying ignoramuses. In the UK, such foolish-minded youths are operating under the label of <b>(so-called) Salafi Media UK</b>, and we will look at some of their main speakers in thi series.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The word retard in its dictionary meaning that is being used here, refers to "<i>a foolish person</i>", one who is "<i>stupid, ineffective</i>" and is similar to the word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) in Arabic, which means, "<i>stupid, ignorant, silly</i>" and what is similar to that. Use of word (<span class='arb'>&#1594;&#1576;&#1610;</span>) can be found in the speech of some of the Scholars to refer to disparaged individuals deserving of the label.  </blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Similarity Between Dumb Thieves Posting Pictures of Their Theft and Takfiri Retards Feigning Salafiyyah</font>    <P>
In the video below <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK") demonstrates the likeness between him and dumb thieves who expose themselves during (or after) their theft (not too intelligent) - examples of this abound in news reports.    <P>

What is the connection between thieves who post pictures online (and get caught) and these types of <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a>. Well let's first find some retarded thieves for illustration:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/retarded-takfiri-dumb-thieves.png width="525" border=0>    <P>
Now, that we have the concept in mind, let us give the sharh (explanation) of the similitude:     <P>
<blockquote>These thieves used deception, cunning, concealment and the likes in order to misappropriate what does not belong to them (the expensive Lamborghini in the picture). Then, being retards, they exposed themselves openly, revealed their true identities and got caught. In a similar vain, these <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> (former Tahriris) - when they got exposed for their Mu'tazilee creed in the late 1990s, they decided to use deception and began operating as "Ahl al-Sunnah", "Ghurabaa", "Saved Sect" and more recently as "Salafis". They did this by speaking about Allaah's Names and Attributes, revolving around Imaam Ahmad and the creation of the Qur'an trial, and some of them now even post videos of the biography of Imaam al-Barbahaaree (taking them from books translated by Salafis of course) - so they tried to resemble the Salafis by trying to talk the same topics and same language. Then, like the retarded thieves mentioned above, we see <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> here revealing openly on social media who his real shaykhs and heroes are, they are <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, Hassan al-Banna, <a href='tags/anwar-al-awlaki.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anwar al-Awlaki</font></a>. Bang goes your claimed Salafiyyah.  <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> is <b>a Jahmee in aqidah</b> (see <a href=http://www.sayyidqutb.com/>sayyidqutb.com</a>) - so naturally, what hypocrisy in behaviour and in walaa and baraa that you claim to preach the aqidah of the Salaf in Names and Attributes and then you aggrandize and promote a Jahmite like <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and call to him, and he is a reviler of Uthmaan (radiyallaahu anhu) and he made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of some of the Companions (radiyallaahu anhum), in particular those from Bani Umayyah.     <P>
So this is the similitude, <a href='tags/abu-waleed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Waleed</font></a> (of the so-called "Salafi Media UK" or "SMUK") through cunning and deception, steals and dons the gown of Salafiyyah, then goes on to expose himself as a thief, liar and fraudster, walhamdulillah. Their hypocritical behaviour and their pretense of walaa and baraa for the Aqidah of Tawhid and of Asmaa and Sifaat and aqidah regarding the Companions is made clear by their own words and deeds.<b> They are walking, talking refutations of themselves</b>. The only thing we have done here is to draw people's attention to this fact.</blockquote>    <P>
