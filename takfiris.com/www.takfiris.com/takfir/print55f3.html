<font class='titleHeadline'>Regarding <a href="tags/ali-al-timimi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ali al-Timimi</font></a></font>    <P>
The <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> (see <a href=index938a.html?jqpkg //>here</a>, <a href=index13c7.html?hulwt >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?xwcmm >here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?sxptl >here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?blaok >here</a> for proof that the Scholars recognize them and label them as a faction with this <u>name</u> and <u>methodology</u>) are boasting these days that <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" aqidah to the youth in the United Kingdom in the early 90s. This was when he had not fully transitioned to the da'wah of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, and in those days he did speak a lot of truth, even if influences of the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> were clearly manifest in some of his speech even at that time. What destroyed <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> was a number of factors, the  most important of them being firstly his attachments to and infatuation with Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq, the Egyptian, through which he eventually got poisoned and overtaken by Qutb's exaggerated doctrines of <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a>. And secondly his long standing commitments towards the Innovators of IANA and his associations with <a href='tags/salaah-as-saawee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salaah as-Saawee</font></a> and other unsavouries amongst the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>. Signs of this affectation could be seen in the early 90s but it wasn't till after the mid-90s that his affair became manifest, and unfortunately it deteriorated from that point onwards after he turned his back upon many of the usool he was previously "<i>spoon-feeding</i>" to others before the mid-90s, and took a portion of the youth towards the Ikhwani methodologies of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq and his likes. This shows that guidance is in Allaah's hands and having plenty of knowledge and understanding of issues does not actually equate to <i>guidance</i> in and of itself. <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Ali al-Timimi on Takfiri <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a> in 1965 Egypt (Arising From the Books and Doctrines of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> al-Ash'ari)</font>    <P>
Here is <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> speaking about the revolutionary and takfiri ideologies that sprung from the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> in 1965 Egypt - click on play to listen to the audio:    <P>

And here is a transcript of the audio:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>However though there is an understanding of Jihaad by some lslaamic groups <b>which is a false understanding of Jihaad, which they innovated</b> ... let us spend some moments discussing this ... Unfortunately a lot of brothers and sisters when they come across those verses or hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) which discuss Jihaad and its virtues and how great and numerous they are, they confuse this new concept or new methodology for Jihaad with those verses and those hadeeth.     <P>
<b>And this new methodology is a destructive methodology and its important that we are aware of it and we warn one another from falling into it and rectify this false methodology.</b></blockquote>    <P>
Unfortunately, when Ahl us-Sunnah continued to warn against this methodology, and warn from the books from which this methodology came, and from the great innovations found in these books, <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> later threw all of this speech behind his back and went and joined the ranks of the very people affected with this ideology. At time of recording of this tape the early signs of affectation were visible upon him, through his speech and in his great admiration of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaaliq who was the flag-bearer of this call and whose Jam'iyyah, Ihyaa at-Turaath, was traveling the world, taking this call to all the various places where Salafis were found, tearing them apart, infusing these teachings amongst them whilst reviling and belittling the true scholars.     <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This false methodology began in <u>the year 1375H (1965CE)</u>. And it brought a new understanding for Jihaad which is against the teachings of the Sharee'ah. It occurred due to the certain situations in the lslaamic world and also due to the certain mindset of those people who propagated this...     <P>
The point is <u>around 1965</u> this <u>new idea of Jihaad</u>, concept of Jihaad was introduced to the Muslim Ummaah. </blockquote>     <P>
This innovated and deviant ideology of Jihaad is what is found in the works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and the particular form of Jihaad that he advocated was in fact <u>the revolutionary ideology of secular atheist Jews, such as Vladimir Lenin</u>. <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> took these basic notions and incorporated them into <i>Milestones </i>and <i>In the Shade of the Qur'an</i> and simply clothed them with an Islamic garb. This has been covered elsewhere in detail. See this article:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Sayyid Qutb:</b> Establishing the <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> of Allaah Through The Atheistic Secular Leninist Manifesto - (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?rhmeq>see here</a>)</ul>    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This idea of Jihaad starts off with <b>the assumption that the lslaamic world are all now societies of <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a> and therefore everybody within those societies are disbelievers, whether the rulers or the ruled</b>. And the reason why is because the Shari'ah is no longer predominant and because the <a href='tags/secular-laws.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Secular Laws</font></a> rule the people. </blockquote>    <P>
Mmm... sounds familiar. Stated <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a>, (az-Zilaal 2/1057):    <P>
<blockquote>The whole of mankind, including those who repeat from the minarets, in the eastern and western parts of the world, the words '<i>Laa ilaaha illallaaha</i>', without any [consideration of] meaning or reality, then they are the most sinful of people and will be the most severely punished on the day of Judgement <b>because they have apostatised by turning to the worship of the servants (of Allaah)</b>...</blockquote>    <P>
Sayyid <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> in "Maaalim fit-Tareeq" (p.8, 17th edition, 1991):    <P>
<blockquote><b>The Ummah (of Islaam) has ceased to be in existence</b> (ghaabat al-Ummah) and has not been perceivable <b>for a very long time</b>. </blockquote>    <P>
And Mohammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> stated in "<i>Waqi'una al-Mu'asir</i>" (p.29),     <P>
<blockquote><b>Certainly, the matter requires that the people be called afresh to Islaam</b>. Not so because they - in this time - refuse to say with their mouths, "<i>Laa ilaaha ilallaaha Muhammad Rasoolullaah</i>", as the people use to refuse to say it in the very first strangeness [i.e. the call of the Prophet Muhammad]. But [more so] because they - in this time - reject the principle requirement of "<i>Laa ilaaha illallaaha</i>" and that is judging to the Sharee'ah of Allaah </blockquote>    <P>
All of this is <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> based upon an exaggerated understanding of <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a>. We don't want to digress with scores of quotes from Qutb's books in which this takfiri ideology is plainly laid out, these are just a couple of quotes as examples, but you can refer to the following articles:    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul>  <li> <b><a href='tags/fareed-abdul-khaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fareed Abdul-Khaliq</font></a></b> (Former Murshid of Ikhwaan): The Emergence of the Doctrines of Jaahliyyah, <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> and <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of All Societies - (<a href=index065a.html?pmjvl>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/yusuf-al-qaradawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</font></a></b>: Groups Known as 'the Qutbiyyoon' Found in Various Places Harboring the Doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> Found in az-Zilaal - (<a href=index13c7.html?hulwt>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/ali-juraisha.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali Juraisha</font></a></b> (Major Ikhwaani Figurehead): Emergence of the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> Who Made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Whole Societies - (<a href=index62cd.html?vdeiu>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/fareed-abdul-khaliq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Fareed Abdul-Khaliq</font></a></b> (Former Murshid of Ikhwaan): The Origins of Mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of Muslim Societies Lie In the Books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - (<a href=indexc30b.html?ezjol>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/yusuf-al-qaradawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</font></a></b>: The <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> of All Societies and Announcement of Destructive Revolutions In the Final Works of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> - (<a href=index2d44.html?wmagi>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/yusuf-al-qaradawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</font></a></b>: The New 'Qutbi' Understanding of Tawheed - (<a href=index938a.html?jqpkg>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/yusuf-al-qaradawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</font></a></b> on Sayyid Qutb: All Muslims Are Apostates (Kuffaar, Mushrikeen) Except Those Who Agree With My Ideology and Join My Group - (<a href=indexe852.html?lyhev>see here</a>)  <li> <b><a href='tags/yusuf-al-qaradawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</font></a></b>: <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> Makes it Explicitly Clear That All Muslims Today Are Disbelievers - (<a href=index2b71.html?xbnsa>see here</a>)  </ul></div>    <P>
The strange thing is that <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a>, in his dramatic style, went on to accuse those who remained upon this truth - (of recognizing and refuting this baatil, false, alien secular atheist Jewish philosophy clothed in the garb of Islaam) - of "<i>changing the concepts of Sunnah and Salafiyyah</i>"! May Allaah guide him and all the people he misled back to the truth. Ameen.    <P>
This call (of making generalized unrestricted takfir) was continued by <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> in their tapes <u>using the very same language</u> of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, and we shall bring examples of that and the refutation of the Major Scholars against them in separate articles.    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Also you find much corruption and disobedience to Allaah and His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in these societies. <b>So therefore everybody whether he's a ruler or being ruled he is an apostate</b>. Likewise all the lslaamic aspects that you find in those societies whether they are schools, or circles for memorising the Qur'aan or masaajid, and scholars, they are all symbols of hypocrisy used to deceive the Muslims to perpetuate this <a href='tags/jahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahiliyyah</font></a> system. They also consider therefore, the masaajid all to be masjid diraar, and they consider therefore that you are not allowed to pray in these masaajid. <b>And that all the imaams who teach in the awqaaf and the different ministries are all kuffaar</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
The thing is that once this vile ideology takes root, then the devils let loose with the suspicions, presumptions, assumptions in the minds of the people and slowly but surely everybody distrusts everybody else and considers him an apostate. This starts of with the government and filters right down to the average common person. This was best exemplified in Algeria in which this vile Qutbi manhaj was in operation amongst the groups of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a>, and the groups of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfir</font></a> had none other than the likes of Abu Qatadah and the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/saudi-arabia.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saudi Arabia</font></a> as their inspiration and that is the subject of another article.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They say all we have to do is we must wage Jihaad to remove this situation, because peaceful means don't bring any benefit, in the sense that since the nature of the contemporary modern state is that it is all pervasive and it controls everything. Then whenever you try to change things through preaching they stop it and so therefore <b>the only way is to rectify it by force of arms</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Marxism, <a href='tags/leninism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninism</font></a>, Bolshevism, that's what all those philosophies said, there's no way except for a violent revolution staged by the masses or by an elite vanguard (as in Leninist-Marxism). This is how Mawdudi tried to falsely portray the da'wah of the Prophets. All of these innovations in Islaam came from these ignoramuses who took the ideologies of secular atheists, and the predominant philosophies of their time and tried to build methodologies of reform around them, misguiding the Ummah through it and corrupting both the intellects and religion of a great number of people in the process.    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So therefore we must <a href='tags/revolt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolt</font></a> against the rulers in society, and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said that in fighting, "<i>al-harbu khid'ah</i>", that you can do trickery in fighting. So therefore we can feign that we want peaceful means but at the same time we are plotting a harmful means. Because the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said this. </blockquote>    <P>
In conventional wars, making use of deception and confounding the enemy is recognized by all nations and all societies for it is part of the strategy of a conventional war. As for what these <a href='tags/leninist-takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Leninist <a href="tags/takfiris.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfiris</font></a></font></a> did of applying this to Muslim societies (and then later to non-Muslim societies when these ideas were taken there), and using this to kill other Muslims (or innocent, non-combatant non-Muslims), take their wealth and consider their women as spoils of war, then this is from the jahl, their vileness and repugnance and it is no wonder that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) spoke with such mighty words against them, declaring them "<u>the dogs of Hellfire</u>", and extolling those who killed such dogs and explaining that <a href='tags/dajjaal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dajjaal</font></a> (the Anti-Christ) will appear amongst the remnants of these people (<a href=index9734.html?zyxuc>see here</a>).     <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Likewise we are allowed to assassinate, because the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) assassinated, or sent people to assassinate al-Ka'b al-Ashraf, who was one of the leading Jewish rabbis who caused harm to the Muslims in Medina.  And likewise all those police forces and armies who defend the rulers and are part of the system, therefore we are allowed to kill them, because there is a rule in the Sharee'ah, like if ... the kuffar take over a Muslim city and they put the Muslims as shields between them and the Muslims, then its okay to kill the Muslims if you have to kill these kuffar. This is a classical way of interpreting it. <b>So therefore those Muslims who support these systems, you must fight and kill</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
Meaning that those who work in the various governmental bodies are just collateral damage and there is no harm if they are killed or targeted, because they are in the way of the "apostate rulers" who are the enemy, and these people working for them in the various bodies can be treated as collateral damage. This is the same kind of reasoning that those who commit acts of terrorism today use. Thanks <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> for your great contribution to Islaam and the Muslims.    <P>
He continues:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And therefore we do not have to openly announce Jihaad, [like] when there are two armies meeting in the battlefield, but we can do secretive sort of activities, put bombs, assassinate and so forth. And therefore all the money of these people, since they are murtaddeen (apostates), it is all halaal to take and steal as we wish, as this is part of al-ghaneemah (spoils of war), and likewise, their women, sine they are all apostates we can take them as our slave girls, and can rape them. We should also not begin, with fighting the people who are originally kufaar, like the Christians and the Jews, who are called kuffaar asliyyoon, (originally disbelievers). But we must begin with the apostates because they cause a greater danger to the Ummaah. And lslaam also is what we find in the Qur'aan and Sunnah only, and as for the understanding of the Sahabah or the Salaf and the other scholars, we're not required to follow this, we're men and their men. <b>And that also we're allowed to enter into different Islaamic movements and try to switch these lslaamic movements to our beliefs</b>, [meaning] we try to enter <u>secretly</u> into them to get their confidence and <u>spread these ideas amongst them so that we make these people believe as we believe</u>. These is some of the characteristics of this new concept of Jihaad... </blockquote>    <P>
Penetrating the jamaa'aat is actually a fundamental part of their strategy and it still is today, for they do not cease to propagandize for these teachings and for the source works of these teachings. And some of these people go further and permit working through the secular system, from the angle that the ends justify the means. This methodology here of penetrating people and other jamaa'aat in a secretive, organized, calculated manner is what is found in many of these Ikhwani, Qutbi, splinter groups and it is what is found in the likes of <a href='tags/hizb-ut-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb ut-Tahrir</font></a> and <a href='tags/al-muhajiroon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muhajiroon</font></a> and others who are found in the West.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><b>And I wish we could have a whole day just refuting this</b> ... The claim that all the Muslims are disbelievers, whether rulers and the ruled is a false claim ...</blockquote>    <P>
Hear well these words! The problem is that when Ahl us-Sunnah spent years doing this, it was <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> himself who led a vanguard of ignoramuses against those who warned from the books of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a> and the great calamities and innovations found therein. What happened to him? Well, its laxity with the Innovators. You see the Salaf were very stern and severe about mixing with the Innovators. But <a href='tags/ali-al-timimi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali al-Timimi</font></a> did not heed that and with his long standing commitments to the Innovators he got poisoned and that's what happens when you belittle the methodologies of the Salaf, for they are methodologies that preserve and protect the capital of Islaam, and when you don't abide by them and take them seriously and think you can make your own ijtihaad, just because you have acquired some knowledge, then that is extremely dangerous.     <P>

The transcript:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...So my point is that this understanding of Jihaad is <u>a false understanding</u>. And it is very important that we educate ourselves to the true meaning of Jihaad, and the true manhaj of Jihaad according to the way of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah. And not have in our minds a mixture of <b>this false methodology which has appeared and spread in the lslaamic world</b>. And we must indeed warn against it, because if you let these people take some ignorant youth with a lot of hot air in them....</blockquote>    <P>
Like what we find on certain discussion forums where all these <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and their allies and defenders let out their steam through sessions of "cyber-butch". In reality, they are just ignorant cowards, and most of what they let off is just hot air which has no substance to it at all, and it certainly provides not an iota of benefit to anyone or to the Ummah.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>...they're going to cause harm to you like they caused in the United States. <b>Therefore we must stand up and be very clear about it and have no qualms that this is against the Sharee'ah of Allaah, and that this is sinfulness</b> ...</blockquote>    <P>
The thing is that's what we have been doing since the beginning of the 1990s, and we've remained upon that and now here is the million-dollar question:    <P>
<b>Who changed?</b> Who left the true Scholars to ally with the Innovators, the Qutbiyyoon, the Harakiyyoon, the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> and Revolutionary Ideologists. And who remained firm with the true Scholars. The manhaj of the true Scholars never changed. That manhaj was clearly known and is fully represented in the sum total of hundreds of statements from the Major Scholars, <u>across a very wide range of issues of methodology</u>, which by the year 2000 had collectively convicted the deviant Ikhwaani methodologies (clothed as Salafiyyah). <b>So who changed?</b> Pray two rakahs in front of your Lord with all sincerity and honesty and then stand up knowing full well that Allaah knows your inner secrets and then answer this question inside your soul!    <P>
