<blockquote>In the video below it is revealed that <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a> (Islamic State of Iraq and Sham) declared apostate and killed a regional leader of <a href='tags/al-nusrah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nusrah</font></a> (Abu Sa'd al-Hadrami) because he was taking bay'ah from members of the FSA (Free Syrian Army). <b>Pay attention here:</b> According to the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Takfiris</font></a> of <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ISIS</font></a>, the regional leader of <a href='tags/al-nusrah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nusrah</font></a> became apostate because he was taking pledges of allegiance from members of FSA (the FSA are a nationalistic opposition to the regime of Bashar Assad). In other words, they were leaving FSA to come and join <a href='tags/al-nusrah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nusrah</font></a>, and taking pledges of allegiance from them made him an apostate! Please take your time to read the statement of Wahb bin Munabbih further below with some deliberation!  The video also reveals the chaos between the various factions, the in-fighting between them and their contending against each other in raising their flags over territories they have captured.    <P>

Wahb bin Munabbih (d. 110H) (rahimahullaah) said (Tarikh Dimashq of Ibn Asaakir):</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I reached (the era) of early Islam and by Allaah, never did the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> have a <i>jamaa'ah</i> except that Allaah split it apart upon the evilness of their conditions. Nor did one of them proclaim his opinion except that Allaah smote his neck. Never did the Ummah unite upon a man from the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a>, ever. And if Allaah had allowed the opinion of the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Kharijites</font></a> to take root, the Earth would have been corrupted, the paths (of travel) would have been cut off, travel for Hajj to the Sanctified House of Allaah would have been cut off and then the affair of Islaam would have returned to that of <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a> until the people would resign to seeking rescue from the mountain-tops, as they used to in <a href='tags/jaahiliyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jaahiliyyah</font></a>. And then there would arise more than ten or twenty men, there not being a man amongst them except that he would claim the <i>khilaafah</i> for himself, and with each man amongst them would be ten-thousand, all fighting each other, and testifying against each other with (the charge of) kufr (disbelief), until a believing man would become fearful for his self, his <i>deen</i>, his blood, his family, his wealth, not knowing where to go and nor whom to be with! </blockquote>    <P>
