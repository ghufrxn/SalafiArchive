<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq</b> is an <u>Egyptian Ikhwani</u> who moved to Kuwait in the 1960s whereupon he began to preach his doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> and the Ikhwani methodologies he was nurtured upon in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>. As his da'wah developed, it was directed at bringing the ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> (takfir, haakimiyyah) and <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> (political activism, party politics) to a Salafi audience, and this was largely achieved in the 1980s through the organization of <b>Jam'iyyah Ihyaa al-Turaath</b>. However, when critiques were made of him in the early to mid 1990s, and when he got slapped down hard by the major Scholars for innovating into the deen of Allaah, he went somewhat undercover and the Jam'iyyah feigned non-attachment to him. In this series we will look at the refutations of Shaykh Abd al-Azeez bin Baz against some of the Ikhwani poison that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq was pushing into the ranks of the Salafis. The Shaykh wrote a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq after six of his books and one cassette were given to the Shaykh. All of these six books comprised elements of Ikhwani methodologies, and the cassette contained revilement against Salafi scholars.  </blockquote></div> <P>




<p><blockquote>In the Shaykh's fataawaa compilation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1580;&#1605;&#1608;&#1593; &#1601;&#1578;&#1575;&#1608;&#1609; &#1608;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1605;&#1578;&#1606;&#1608;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), there is a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq on numerous issues of manhaj. Here is one of those points (8/244-245):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/binbaz-arak-06.png width="540" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>Sixthly:</b> You mentioned in your book "<i>Fusool Min al-Siyaasah al-Shar'iyyah</i>" (pp. 31-32) that from the ways and means of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in da'wah (calling to Allaah) is open demonstrations. And I do not know of any (revealed) text having this meaning, so I wish (for you to) provide information about who mentioned that? And in which book did you find that? And if you do not have any support for that, then it is obligatory to recant from taht, because I do not know  anything from the texts that indicate that. And when the many harms (mafaasid) in using demonstrations are known, then if there is an authentic text in this regard, then  what that text has come with (in actuality) must be made completely clear so that the mischief-makers do not cling to it with their futile demonstrations. </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Note</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq is an Ikhwani from <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, upon the manhaj of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and naturally, taking their ways is not surprising, ascribing to the deen that which is not from it, and making tabdeel of the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> by ascribing demonstrations to the deen of Islaam, making permissible splitting in the religion (<a href=../ikhwanis.com/index4c95.html?bawmfvs>see here</a>), innovating into the matter of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> and what is more. This is one of his disgraces in trying to argue, with futility, for demonstrations, distorting certain incidents in the Prophetic seerah, in order to argue for this way that is actually taken from the Marxists and <a href='tags/communists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communists</font></a>.     <P>
