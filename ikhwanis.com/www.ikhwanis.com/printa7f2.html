<blockquote><img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/rageah-shia-shariah.gif align=right style="margin:6px 0px 8px 15px;" border="1" width="300" border=0> To the right is <a href='tags/saed-rageah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saed Rageah</font></a>, he is a speaker for <b>al-Maghrib Institute</b> - an institute which actively pursues the goal of separating <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> from the senior, aged, well-known Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah (with whom lies right-guidance and safety) and instead binds them to their own instructors and speakers whose personalities and characters are presented with Hollywood style promotionals. His listed teachers include <a href='tags/abd-al-azeez-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abd al-Azeez al-Fawzaan</font></a> (learn more about him <a href=../ikhwanis.com/index337f.html?zowfjuf>in this article</a>) Rageah's expertise is listed as "Islamic Shariah" in his brief biographical information and he is said to bring "a whole new ball game to the classroom" - an example of which is illustrated in this article - a whole new ballgame in casually presenting the government of the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-zm.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a></font></a> <a href='tags/shiah-ec.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shiah-cf.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/shiah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shi'ah</font></a></font></a></font></a> with implied praise.  In the video (<a href=rageah-shiah-shariah5e26.mp3?a=eausru>listen to audio here</a>) he is asked a question as to whether the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is implemented fully anywhere on the earth. In his answer he says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>Is there any country that is implementing <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> fully? Not that I know, the closest one, the closest one, not that I know I should say, but the closest one, outwardly, when you see it outside, from the Sunni, are Saudia, and from the <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shiah</font></a>, <a href='tags/iran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iran</font></a>. Other than that ... from outside, from outside, but according to the <a href='tags/shiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shiah</font></a> madhhab, according to the Sunni madhhab. </blockquote>    <P>
Answers to questions reveal precisely and exactly what a person is grasping in his mind and whether he is rooted in the foundations of the Islamic creed and methodology. This is what we will explore in the brief notes and observations that follow below:    <P>
<b>ONE:</b> We do not know of any of the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, Scholars rooted in the pristine <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> who make mention of <u>the <a href='tags/rafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Rafidah</font></a> Shi'ah</u> - the enemies of the Sahaabah (radiallaahu anhum), liars and disputants to Allaah, worshippers of their Imaams  - in <u>the same breath</u> as the people of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Sunnah in relation to the issue of implementing the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> of Islam. Further, the word Shari'ah in its broad usage is not restricted to laws only, it refers to Islam as a whole, it is a "tariqah, sunnah, minhaj" (al-Tabari) inclusive of beliefs and actions. The <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> of Islam is founded upon the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, following the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and love, veneration and respect of the Companions (radiallaahu anhum) and following their fahm (understanding) of the Book and Sunnah.     <P>
<b>TWO:</b> Those who speak in this particular manner and style are the Ikhwan (<a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a>) who have an active policy of taqreeb (closeness with the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-zm.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a></font></a> Shi'ah) and they speak of the Iranian State in the context of Khomenei's "Islamic" <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a>, on the basis of which they portray that the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> is being observed in that country by the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-zm.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a></font></a>. It was Mawdudi who said that the <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> of Khomenei was an Islamic <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> behind which was an Islamic jamaa'ah. Hence, this type of speech coming from those Ikhwanis is aimed at giving or portraying legitimacy to the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-zm.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a></font></a> and their madhhab - in line with their broad policy of taqreeb (nearness). As it relates to Rageah, his remark is one that would never be made by a person who has had tarbiyah (cultivation) upon <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Sunnah, and who adheres to the tariqah (way) of the Salaf, in creed and methodology. Rather, it indicates a confused and befogged mind that is not rooted in the foundations, the signs of which become readily apparent when we see answers like these.    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> This type of confusion and lack of grounding is extremely dangerous for average <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> wishing for safety and good grounding in their deen. If you can't grasp this point, then consider the fact that a very small, insignificant fault can often lead to disastrous consequences in cars, airplanes and the likes, because of the inter-connectivity and inter-relatedness between the whole. Likewise, when we see flaws like these in certain areas (of a person's speech or action), it has implications on the whole and just as a person would not be satisfied with defective merchandise, so too should they be unsatisfied with instructors who spread defective and flawed perceptions that have implications upon the greatest foundations of the religion. Seriously, do you think any bonafide, genuine Scholar of Ahl al-Sunnah is going to give an answer such as this one? That's the difference between genuine scholars and artificially-inflated personalities like Rageah.    <P>
