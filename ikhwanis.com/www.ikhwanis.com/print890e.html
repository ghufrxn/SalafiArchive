<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq</b> is an <u>Egyptian Ikhwani</u> who moved to Kuwait in the 1960s whereupon he began to preach his doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> and the Ikhwani methodologies he was nurtured upon in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>. As his da'wah developed, it was directed at bringing the ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> (takfir, haakimiyyah) and <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> (political activism, party politics) to a Salafi audience, and this was largely achieved in the 1980s through the organization of <b>Jam'iyyah Ihyaa al-Turaath</b>. However, when critiques were made of him in the early to mid 1990s, and when he got slapped down hard by the major Scholars for innovating into the deen of Allaah, he went somewhat undercover and the Jam'iyyah feigned non-attachment to him. In this series we will look at the refutations of Shaykh Abd al-Azeez bin Baz against some of the Ikhwani poison that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq was pushing into the ranks of the Salafis. The Shaykh wrote a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq after six of his books and one cassette were given to the Shaykh. All of these six books comprised elements of Ikhwani methodologies, and the cassette contained revilement against Salafi scholars.  </blockquote></div> <P>




<p><blockquote>In the Shaykh's fataawaa compilation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1580;&#1605;&#1608;&#1593; &#1601;&#1578;&#1575;&#1608;&#1609; &#1608;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1605;&#1578;&#1606;&#1608;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), there is a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq on numerous issues of manhaj. Here is one of those points (8/242):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/binbaz-arak-02.png width="540" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>Secondly: You said in the cassette entitled, "al-Madrasah al-Salafiyyah" whose text is, "<i>Verily, a group of the Scholars in <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> are in complete blindness (oblivion) and complete ignorance about the new problems .. and their <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is a blind-following <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> that is worth nothing</i>." End quote.    <P>
This is a baatil (false) saying, for the Scholars of Saudi know the problems of the era and they have written a great deal about them, and I am from them by the praise of Allaah. And I have written in this regard what cannot be enumerated, and they, by Allaah's praise, are the from the most knowledgeable of people of the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah and they traverse upon what the Righteous Salaf traversed upon in the field of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> of Allaah, in the field of the Names and Attributes, and in the field of warning from innovations, and in all the (various) fields.    <P>
So if you are ignorant of them, then read Majmoo'ah Ibn Qaasim (al-Durar al-Saniyyah), the Fataawaa of our Shaykh, Muhammad bin Ibraaheem (rahimahullaah), and read what we have written in our fataawaa and in our books that are widespread amongst the people.    <P>
And there is no doubt that what you have said about the Scholars of Saudi is not correct, it is an error and an evil. So it is obligatory upon you to recant from that and to openly announce that in the local newspapers in Kuwait and Saudi. We ask, for us and for you, guidance and returning to the truth and firmness upon it, for indeed He is the best one who is asked. </blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> Revilement of the Salafi scholars is a key feature of the methodology of these <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a>, Qutbis, Ikhwanis and this is an instrumental part of their agenda because by tearing them away from the deeply-grounded scholars (by accusing those scholars of not knowing current affairs and being ignorant), they can then lead the common masses into their innovated methodologies (which are secular in origin) and which include demonstrations, rallies, revolutions, party politics, engagement with democracy and so on. The Jam'iyyah of <a href='tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a> has amassed huged amounts of wealth through the medium of "charity work" and they have many different fronts in the form of <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a> organizations. These <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a> organizations then seek out communities, mosques and centres in various Muslim and non-Muslim lands whereby they give financial assistance and attach conditions so that the da'wah given through these institutions fits in with a particular agenda which is Ikhwani in perception and outlook. Currently, <a href='tags/ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a>, through the cover of <a href='tags/charity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>charity</font></a> organizations is funding mosques and centres in the United Kingdom and from them is <a href='tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a> in Birmingham.    <P>
