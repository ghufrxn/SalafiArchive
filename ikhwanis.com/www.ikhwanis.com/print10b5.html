<blockquote>Salman al-Awdah and <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> are two Ikhwani stooges upon the  methodology of <a href='tags/hassan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hassan al-Banna</font></a>, Yusuf al-Qardawi and others from the Ikhwan. The <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> is an organization set up to accommodate all the enemies of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and the Sunnah, from the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, Quburiyyah, <a href='tags/communists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communists</font></a>, <a href='tags/mutazilah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Mu'tazilah</font></a>, <a href='tags/ashariyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ash'ariyyah</font></a> and others and to mobilize the masses against those in authority with the goal of toppling them and wrestling power from them in order to establish "social justice", "equality" and "freedom" all under the slogan of "Islamic da'wah." There are two major strains of thought represented by <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/hassan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hassan al-Banna</font></a>. The strain of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and haakimiyyah (<a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>) and the strain of pluralism (Banna). <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, al-Areefee and others are callers to this way. Just like the Ash'aris and <a href='tags/ahl-al-kalaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Kalaam</font></a> make ta'weel of and distort the Sunnah that clashes with their innovation (and likewise the Qadariyyah, <a href='tags/murjiah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Murji'ah</font></a>, Khawaarij and all the other sects), these Ikhwanis have taken the same approach, to distort and make ta'weel of that which relates to the issue of <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>, rulership, hearing and obeying and related issues. They wish to undermine these foundations of the Sunnah so they are left to nurture the youth upon their ideologies which clash with the Sunnah. What follows below is a clear, lucid illustration of these types of attempts.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Salman al-Awdah and <a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a> Fabricate a Lie Upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</font>    <P>
<blockquote>  <img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/areefee-rulers-claim.gif border=1 style="margin:6px 0px 8px 15px;" border="1" align="right" width="270" border=0> Over a year ago, <b><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b> began giving an explanation to the hadeeth of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam),  the hadeeth related by Hudhaifah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu anhu) in which the Messenger advised hearing and obeying the ruler (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1573;&#1606; &#1590;&#1585;&#1576; &#1592;&#1607;&#1585;&#1603; &#1608;&#1575;&#1582;&#1584; &#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1603;</span>), "<i>Even if your back is beaten and your wealth is confiscated</i>." So <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> came out with a <i>bid'iyy</i>, <i>khaarijiyy</i> interpretation, that this command is only in relation to a sole individual when the ruler oppresses him specifically in a matter that is between him and the ruler, he is ordered to hear and obey. But as for when the rights of the society at large are affected, then this hadeeth does not apply to this situation, here the general Qur'anic texts which order with the fulfilling of rights, and judging by what Allaah has revealed and so on, they come into play and as such it is necessary and take measures to restore those rights. After this, <b><a href='tags/muhammad-al-areefee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muhammad al-Areefee</font></a></b> (student of Salman al-Awdah), came out with the same <i>bid'iyy, khaarijiyy</i> explanation (<a href=areefee-hukkaam-claim960d.mp3?a=areefee-hukkaam-claim.mp3>listen to audio</a>). He also tweeted this same explanation (see picture). Al-Areefee says that the hadeeth only applies to a specific individual who has a problem with the ruler. Then he goes on (in the audio) to mention how the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> say we have no money because the economy is bad, then all of a sudden they announce a 20% increase in (government) salaries. Al-Areefee says, "<i>so where has the money come from now, did it come from the sky?</i>" He says "<i>it was there all along, in the banks and in foreign banks</i>". This is from the same fountain as the saying of <b>Dhul-Khuwaysarah</b> against the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "Fear Allaah and be just",  that of "social justice". This was the saying of the Marxists, <a href='tags/communists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communists</font></a> and Leninists whose books <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a></b> was gulping down for 15 years of his life, that of "social justice." <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> wrote books on it and through this Communist, Marxist ideological filth, he attacked the honour of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) made <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of Mu'awiyyah and Bani Umayyah. This was the saying of <b>Muhammad Suroor</b>, the Qa'di Kharijee. This was the saying of the Qutbiyyah of Saudi Arabia who were labelled "<i>Khawaarij of the Era</i>" by Imaam al-Albaani. This is part of the wider strategy of these Ikhwaanees - <b>that of <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> in the name of "social justice", "equality" and "freedom"</b> - they try to demolish those usool in the Sunnah which stand in the way of their innovated methodologies. </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Scholars Bury This Bid'ah</font>    <P>
<blockquote>This attempt to fabricate a lie against Allaah and His Messenger (and Imaam al-Nawawi) did not go unchecked for the Scholars of Sunnah refuted this falsehood, from them <b><a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a></b> (<a href=fawzan-areefee-hukkaam16c1.mp3?a=fawzan-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a>), <b>The Muftee, Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal al-Shaykh</b> (<a href=muftee-areefee-hukkaam5aa1.mp3?a=muftee-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a>), <b>Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree</b> (<a href=ubayd-areefee-hukkaamd6df.mp3?a=ubayd-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a>), <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</b> (<a href=mohd-haadee-areefee-hukkaam34b6.mp3?a=mohd-haadee-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a>) and others [refer also to <i>Shaykh Hamad al-Ateeq's</i> refutation of al-Areefee (<a href=hamad-ateeq-areefee-hukkaam486c.mp3?a=hamad-ateeq-areefee-hukkaam.mp3>listen to audio</a>) in which he requests al-Areefee to find us any sayings from the Salaf for this (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1607;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1583;&#1610;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1576;&#1578;&#1583;&#1593;</span>) "<i>new innovated understanding</i>", check the very end of the audio]. Here is a quick summary of what is in the audios: <b>Shaykh al-Fawzan</b>, "this is a saying of <u>a person of desires</u> who says upon the Messenger that which he did not say." <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</b>, "this is the saying of a <u>liar</u>, <u>ignoramus</u>, <u>person of desires</u>..., it pleases us that those misguided ones have been refuted by the leading heads of the carriers of the Shari'ah and the Scholars of Islaam... the Muftee (Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal al-Shaykh)... and the Shaykh, Allaamah, Saalih bin Fawzan al-Fawzaan..." <b>Shaykh Ubayd</b>, "How excellent is what was said by Abu Uthman al-Naysaboor, 'Whoever nurtured himself with the sunnah, in speech and action, will speak with wisdom (hikmah) and whoever nurtured himself with desire (hawaa) in speech and action, will speak with bid'ah'."</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Muhammad al-Areefee Fabricates a Lie Upon Imaam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> in Order to Protect His Lie Upon the Messenger of Allaah</font>    <P>
<blockquote>When this bid'ah (innovated) was slapped down by the Scholars, and Shaykh al-Fawzaan said what he said (that whoever says this is person of desires), al-Areefee, in order to do some damage limitation went to see <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a> and to make a "clarification". <b>So his clarification to the Shaykh was that he had not brought this from  himself but he based it upon some speech of Imaam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> (rahimahullaah) which he merely quoted</b>. This was given some online coverage (<a href=../www.themadkhalis.com/md/assets/images/fawzan-areefee-visit.jpg>see this article</a>). Shaykh Salih al-Fawzaan is reported to have said, allegedly, that he did not mean to label al-Areefee in person as a person of desires but was only addressing the actual incorrect statement and making a general remark when it was brought to him. As far as we know, this is not on tape and there is a justifiable reason to doubt al-Areefee's integrity and to challenge his honesty. See what follows below of a further clarification which Shaykh al-Fawzaan himself wrote and put out publicly afterwards which indicates there is lack of integrity on behalf of al-Areefee and those with him - and that they cannot be trusted to tell the truth.  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan Checks Sharh Sahih Muslim of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> and Indicates the Lie of al-Areefee</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan then went and checked the explanation of Sahih Muslim by Imaam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> to verify the claim of al-Areefee and those with him. <b>The Shaykh felt it important enough to put out a public clarification when he realized they ascribed to <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> that which he is free of</b>. In this clarification below <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a> clarified a great and mighty foundation of Ahl al-Sunnah, one that no Salafi who has read and studied the books of the Salaf can be confused about or can claim to be confused about.     <P>
The Shaykh followed up with a clarification on his website (<a href=http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/13975>original here</a>) (<a href=../www.themadkhalis.com/md/assets/images/fawzaan-areefee-claim.jpg>screenshot</a>), dated 27th May 2012:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>Notification of an Error Regarding the Explanation of the Hadeeth, "Even if Your Back is Beaten and Your Wealth is Taken"</b>    <P>
All praise is due to Allaah, and may prayers and salutations be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions. To proceed: There has come in Sahih Muslim in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (radiallaahu anhu) regarding tribulations and what is obligatory upon a Muslim when they appear - specifically in relation to what occurs from some of <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of oppression and <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> - where the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in this hadeeth, "<i>Hear and obey the ruler even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken</i>."    <P>
<b>This became problematic to some of the brothers until some of them said about this hadeeth that it is addressed (only) to an individual present in an Arabic environment which scorns obedience (to the ruler) and rejects oppression, and perhaps that might carry him (individually) to reject obedience (to the ruler) in that which is good, or to split off or to stand up to fight [and  thus constitutes a prohibition at the individual level], and then they began to interpret it upon other than its (actual) meaning so that they can take it away from its apparent (dhaahir) meaning. <u>Then, when objection was made against them, they attributed (this interpretation) to Imaam al-Nawawi</u>, but upon returning to the explanation of Imaam <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> of Sahih Muslim with respect to this hadeeth, we found that he says in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah (radiallaahu anhu), when he said to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "How shall I behave O Messenger of Allaah, if that reaches me" he means what occurs of <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> from the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> and their oppression. He replied, "You must hear and obey the ruler even if you back is beaten and your wealth is taken." <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> said, "(Even if your back is beaten), unjustly, (and your wealth is taken), without due right, with the verb being constructed upon the passive form in both places, and they comprise the condition (shart) for the response (you must hear and obey) him in what is other than disobedience" - end quote. <u>This is the actual text of the explanation of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a> upon this hadeeth in that he left it upon its apparent meaning  and import and he did not make ta'weel of it to what those brothers said.</u></b>     <P>
This hadeeth and its like comprises <u>a mighty foundation</u> from the foundations of the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah in adhering to the jamaa'ah of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, having patience upon the <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> and oppression of the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> because of what results from that of mighty benefits, such as preserving the blood of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and protecting their honours, their safety and settlement (in the land). And these are benefits that are above, by a great deal, than the associated harm that comes with them of bearing  their <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> with patience. More harmful than this (having patience) is the harm of revolting, and  splitting the ranks of the jaamaa'ah. This is from (the principle of) bearing the least of two harms in order to repel the greater of them, <u>and this is a mighty principle from the principles of Islaam</u>. For the purpose of making notification of the error which has occcurred with respect to this  topic from some of the brothers, I wrote about  that.    <P>

<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan Reaffirms What He Said Initially That Those Who Give This False Interpretation Are People of Desires</font>    <P>
<blockquote>After the Shaykh wrote the above clarification and made it public, seeing that the people should be protected from this shubhah (misconception), a question was posed to the Shaykh on the same subject and the Shaykh reaffirmed what he said in his initial statement, that it is desire (hawaa) that is leading those people to distort this hadeeth, and that it was a lie upon <a href='tags/ibn-hajar.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, because they never said any such thing in the interpretation of the hadeeth. This establishes that al-Areefee is a kadhdhaab. You can download and listen to the Shaykh's answer (<a href=fawzan-2nd-areefee-hawaa022b.mp3?a=vlexhj>listen to audio</a>), the Shaykh says:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>The hadeeth is general, it is not directed to the individual (only), it is general, for the subjects of Ummah, the hadeeth of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), the one who describes it (upon) other than its meaning, this one from desire (hawaa), he wishes to explain the hadeeth upon their desire and their orientation and doctrinal school... the hadeeth is general, and we did not find this in the speech of <a href='tags/al-nawawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Nawawi</font></a>, we did not find it...I investigated it and I did not find it.</blockquote>    <P>
This constitutes a firm conviction (for the second time) against the lying Ikhwanis!  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Conclusion</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Alhamdulillaah, Allaah exposed these treacherous Ikhwanis (Salman al-Awdah, al-Areefee and those with them) through the clarifications of <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a> and all the other scholars who refuted this falsehood. And these Ikhwanis were outed for their attempts to lie upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Scholars of Islaam in order to serve their vile and filthy (Ikhwani) agendas.</blockquote> <P>
