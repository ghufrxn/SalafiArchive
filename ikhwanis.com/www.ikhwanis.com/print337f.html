<div class='sidebar'>  <img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/abdaziz-fawzan-ytube.gif align=right style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" border="1" border=0>There is to be found a network of individuals who are poisoned with the fikr of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen and they are taken as Shaykhs and promoted as being students of the major Scholars. We warn the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> from these types of individuals no matter how lofty and glowing their credentials appear to be. One of the things utterly detested by these people is the fact that Ahl al-Sunnah give importance to <b>the Salafi manhaj</b>, its clarification and its propagation to the masses, the result of which is that more and more <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are able <b>to distinguish the manhaj of the Salaf</b> from the foreign alien methodologies thrust upon them by dubious callers paraded as Shaykhs. It is precisely this that agitates and disturbs individuals like <b>Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzaan</b> leading them to fabricate lies against Ahl al-Sunnah. What else  would you expect from an individual who praises <a href='tags/hamas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hamas</font></a> (<a href=../ikhwanis.com/indexd221.html?ysztzka>see here</a>), makes excuses for them and their ties with <a href='tags/iran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iran</font></a>? <a href=http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=99496>See his great fabrications and mighty lies torn to pieces right here</a>. In the video to the right, Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzaan is fabricating lies against Ahl al-Sunnah in Europe, saying how he visits those lands and finds people who have only been Muslim for two days and the first thing you hear from them is "manhaj" and attacks against the "major scholars" and we do not consider except that he intends by major scholars, the major figureheads of the Hizbiyyeen, from the Qutbiyyah, Ikhwaniyyah and "Islamists" (those pursuing power using Islam only as a means to fulfil their desire for power). This is a well-known form of rhetoric and these fabrications and exaggerations are propagated in very generalized ways without ever giving specifics, because there are none!   Inshaa'Allaah in a separate article we can address the particular video, but we alluded to it here just so you can understand where this individual is coming from. He is just another individual poisoned with the methodologies of al-Ikhwan al-Muslim. His suspect and questionable shaykhdom is pulverised below by the great Scholar, Allaamah, <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a>.   </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzaan Claims Demonstrations are Permissible with Conditions and Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaans Demolishes This Baseless Claim</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In <a href=fawzan-on-aa-fawzan-demos2ba0.mp3?a=lfenqu>this audio clip</a> Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzan claims that "<i>demonstrations are the most superior form of expression in this era, in terms of requesting rights, across all of the world</i>" and then he says "<i>I consider them permissible with two conditions</i>" and then outlines the two conditions. The first he says that the authorities (nidhaam) of the country (meaning the regulations) must permit them and the second is that they must be peaceful. He then says that if these two conditions are met, then "...<i>there is no harm in them, rather, in reality, they are from the best forms of expression in accordance with the practices (customs) of most of the nations of the world</i>..."     <P>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="../ikhwanis.com/mp3player.swf" width="200" height="20"><param name="movie" value="../ikhwanis.com/mp3player.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http://ikhwanis.com/assets/audios/fawzan-on-aa-fawzan-demos.mp3&amp;showvolume=1&amp;loadingcolor=ff75ff" /></object>    <P>
When you hear these words from him, then you will come to realize why hateful individuals like Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzaan detest speech about manhaj and why they make mockery of those adhering to the way of the Salaf and ridicule them. It is because those holding fast to the methodology of the Salaf by holding fast to the Imaams of the Sunnah in our time, like, Shaykh Bin Baz, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh al-Fawzaan, Shaykh al-Ghudayaan, Shaykh Rabee' al-Madkhali, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmi and many others, then they are upon baseerah about individuals such as Abdul-Azeez al-Fawzaan who permit the methodologies of Marx, <a href='tags/lenin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lenin</font></a>, Trotsky, Rousseau and others all in the name of "demanding rights" and "social justice." We've heard these slogans before in history O <a href='tags/abd-al-azeez-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abd al-Azeez al-Fawzaan</font></a> and alhamdulillaah, the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of Europe are growing all the more aware of liars and resentful invididuals like you who resent their connection with genuine scholars such as <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a>.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>By the way, do not let all those credentials of having studied with Shaykh Bin Baz and Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen fool you. This is actually a further revilement upon an individual in that he is an opposer to those Shaykhs whose names are deceptively employed in order to help launder his dirty, corrupt methodology to an unsuspecting audience.</b></div>    <P>
So here are the words of <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a>, in refutation of this individual (also in the audio above), first the question posed:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>Question:</b> There is a (person) who when the Committee of Major Scholars issued a fatwa regarding the unlawfulness of demonstrations due to them being causes of corruption, there was found (an individual) who says that demonstrations are of two types: A type in which there is no looting and [unclear] and no mixing (between sexes) and they are merely to demand the rights of the people then they are permissible. And when they comprise corruption, damage and looting then they are haraam (unlawful), so what is your reply to him?</blockquote>    <P>
And the Shaykh's answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>Ask him, is there are any basis for demonstrations? Is there a basis for them amongst <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, whether in the past or in recent (times)? Demonstrations were not known except from the West, from the West. They are not from Islam at all. Islam encourages disciplinary (order), it encourages with peace (serenity) it encourages absence of chaos. Rights are not attained through chaos and screams. They are attained through legislated ways and through ways other than the way of demonstrations. No one is prevented from raising a complaint, no one is prevented from seeking a right of his, no one is prevented from that. As for demonstrations then they are not from the deen of Islaam! <b>And I say and I will repeat it again [with raised voice] they are not from the deen of Islaam! And nor from the manners of the Muslims! Rather, they have come to us through Western schemings in order to tear apart the (united) jamaa'ah and to split the people and bring about enmity.</b></blockquote>    <P>
You see - dear reader - this is why these people are resentful and hateful of speech about "manhaj" (methodology) - it is because they propagate corrupt methodologies in the name of Islam, Sunnah and often <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. And they detest clarity and taking matters to the Major Scholars, even though they often deceive the people by having claimed to study under the Major Scholars, the while they oppose those very same Major Scholars in foundational principles of the religion. Then they label and accuse others of being "Jaamiyyah" (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?ugyiy>see here</a>) and "Madkhliyyah" - names used to hinder people from the Straight path of Allaah, the Exalted.    <P>
<b>Of what benefit is it to parade Abd al-Azeez al-Fawzan as "a cousin of Sheikh Saalih al-Fawzan" (see picture above) when <a href='tags/abd-al-azeez-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abd al-Azeez al-Fawzaan</font></a> propagates an orientation influenced by the manhaj of Dhul-Khuwaisarah, <a href='tags/abdullah-bin-saba.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdullah bin Saba'</font></a>, <a href='tags/karl-marx.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Karl Marx</font></a>, Frederick Engels, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Vladimir <a href='tags/lenin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lenin</font></a>, Abu A'laa Mawdudi and <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and others who raise the banner of "social justice" and "demanding rights" and on the other hand <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a> propagates the manhaj taught by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) until even in relation to "<i>men with the hearts of devils in the bodies of men</i>"?!</b>    <P>
And whilst we point out these matters, one should also be aware of the students of the likes of these people, who study with them and then come over to the west and spread the same poison and venom, and an example of that is <a href='tags/saed-rageah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Saed Rageah</font></a> (<a href=../ikhwanis.com/indexa7f2.html?zgtfbzo>see here</a>) whose listed teachers include <a href='tags/abd-al-azeez-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abd al-Azeez al-Fawzaan</font></a>.  </blockquote> <P>
