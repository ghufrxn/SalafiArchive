<div class='sidebar'>  <blockquote><b><a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a></b> is from the Extremist Qutbiyyah (followers of the doctrines of Sayyid Qutb) (see <a href=http://sayyidqutb.com/>SayyidQutb.Com</a>) who emerged in the early 1990s (after the Gulf War) attempting to push the doctrines of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> to the Saudi masses. He along with others (<a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>) spread the ideology of <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a> to the youth and were inciting the masses against the Scholars and the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>. They belittled the Scholars  (Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a> and others) and accused them of ignorance, and also propagated <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a> of the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> and of the Saudi government. They managed to rouse a segment of the society, however, when their affair was brought to the Scholars and they were advised, but continued upon their path, and the Scholars realized they were propagating the ideology of the <a href='tags/khawarij.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/khawarij-ul.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Khawarij</font></a></font></a>, they were apprehended and imprisoned in 1997 by order of Shaykh Abd al-Azeez bin Baz (rahimahullaah). As a result, the followers they had put on this path and nurtured upon the manhaj of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>, moved onto other more extreme elements such as Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, <a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a>, Nasir al-Fahd and their likes. There is no doubt that these Qutbiyyah (Safar al-Hawali, <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, <a href='tags/aaid-al-qarnee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'id al-Qarnee</font></a> etc.) were responsible for misguiding a large share of the youth and pushing them in this disastrous direction.    <P>
However, <b>when the chicken came home to roost</b>, as in, the effects and results of that <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a>, Qutbi, Khariji nurturing became manifest (in the form of terrorist incidents), <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> - when confronted - outed himself as a liar and tried to absolve himself of any blame. Listen to the discussion below:    <P>
</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Safar al-Hawali Confronted and Outed as a Liar By Musa Abd al-Aziz in Discussion Following Terrorist Atrocity Committed by <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a> in Saudi Arabia</font>    <P>
This is a discussion that took place on one of the satellite channels a day after a terrorist attack took place in Saudi Arabia, killing innocent people and causing destruction. The first voice is that of the interviewer, who introduces <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> and Musa Abd al-Aziz.     <P>
<blockquote><iframe src="http://archive.org/embed/SafarElhaweli" width="570" height="420" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe>    <P>
Musa Abd al-Aziz speaks first (0:40) and he explains that the doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a> and hakimiyyah, this ideology is what is behind these activities, and it was the fikr of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> that was brought into the Saudi Kingdom that led to this, and this was imported by the <i>ad-du'at al-mutahazzibeen</i> (partisan callers). <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> is listening to all of this and he knows in his soul that he is the one responsible for this, he (along with other Qutbiyyah) was responsible for this <i>fikr</i> - and he was actually a student of Mohammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> (the brother of Sayyid Qutb). So al-Hawali knows he is guilty, a hundred percent, and he knows he is in a sticky situation.    <P>
Then the intervewing journalist asks al-Hawali to speak (2:00) and says to him that the Saudi Kingdom is being targeted and what can the Kingdom do to deal with this issue.    <P>
Al-Hawali then speaks, <b>and you are knocked senseless by the stench of hypocrisy</b> as he proceeds with his answer which lasts almost four minutes and he is led by the interviewer to condemn these acts and label those responsible as terrorists.    <P>
Then the interviewer asks Musa Abd al-Aziz (5:45) to provide a solution. So before answering the question, he addresses <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a>, confronts him, outs him as a liar and tells him in no uncertain terms that you are the one responsible for this fikr coming into the Kingdom - it did not exist before - and you are the one who brought this Qutbi, <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a> ideology into the Kingdom. His answer starts at (6:00) and lasts for a full three minutes. He tells al-Hawali you brought this ideology, you turned the youth away from the Major scholars, you are the ones who spread sayings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>. Shouldn't you take account of yourself from the generalized <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a> that was spread, because you are the one who spread it in the kingdom. Then he says to al-Hawali, "<i>this talbees (deception) is not permissible</i>", meaning, this deception you are carrying out right here, pretending to be innocent. He says, that rather, we should speak the truth. Then he demands al-Hawali to answer a few points related to the above.     <P>
Then the interview interjects and asks <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> to respond to the points raised with respect to him and that this whole issue revolves around the <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> callers and this ideology. And here we see al-Hawali turn into a kitten and expose himself for the cowardly liar that he is (9:30), he essentially says to the interviewer that these types of accusations are not befitting and the discussion should be around providing a solution and that the accusations made should be written down and presented in a  law-court that will then judge between him and the other person (Musa Abd al-Azeez). This is while he knows in his soul, just as everyone reading this who is familiar with the history of these Qutbiyyah, even the fanatics amongst them who are still with al-Hawali, they all know in their souls that al-Hawali is lying and he is a coward and that he is a hundred percent guilty of what he was accused of, yet he was unable to answer, when exposed for his hypocrisy and attempted deception!    <P>
<b>Endnote:</b> <a href='tags/safar-al-hawali.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Safar al-Hawali</font></a> is from a group of callers who were pushing the ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> (a Rafidee, <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a>, Khariji, Jahmee in his aqidah) (see <a href=http://sayyidqutb.com/>SayyidQutb.Com</a>) and they were mobilizing the youth against the scholars and <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>. They taught softness, lenience towards these deviants from <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> who are the main figureheads of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen whilst nurturing hate, separation, distrust and aversion from the scholars of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Sunnah, all of which indicates their treachery. By Allaah's praise they were unsuccessful in their attempts in the 90s to precipitate a <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a>. To date, they have not declared their tawbah (repentance) from their crimes and atrocities and continue with their deception and hypocrisy, hoping that the light is not shined on them in incidents like this one.     <P>
