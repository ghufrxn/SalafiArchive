<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>  The <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> is an umbrella organization which aims to accommodate all the various astray sects in Islam in order to mobilize them into revolutions (or entry into democracy) so as to attain power for themselves. The Islam they envisage is not the Islam of the Book and the Sunnah but a modern version of Islam, the nature and reality of which is discussed in other articles on this website. The call of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> is similar to that of the Zionists (the "Ikhwanis" of the Jews), who pursue a political state for the Jews, and likewise that of Khomeini (a religious political state for the Shi'a), and they permit all types of subterfuge, dissimulation, deception, treachery and alliances with all categories of people in order to fulfil their goal. The starting point of their call is not the starting point of the call of the Messengers, which is establishing the broad, all-inclusive, <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of Allaah (in the hearts), revival the Sunnah and killing off innovation. Rather, we see in their countries idols worshipped besides Allaah and millions upon the <a href='tags/shirk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shirk</font></a> that would enter them into the Fire on the Day of Judgement, yet the Ikhwan have no concern with that at all. As a result, tribulations, trials and chaos follow the methodologies of Ikhwan. The Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah such as Imaam <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, <a href='tags/imaam-ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ibn Baz</font></a>, and Imaam Ibn Uthaymeen all died whilst they considered al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon to be an astray deviant sect. The prominent Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah continue to warn from this political jamaa'ah that has brought untold corruption and harm in the affairs of the world and religion. And the prominent Scholars of the Sunnah in the mid-20th century in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> also wrote against al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon during that time. Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Fiqqee, Shaykh <a href='tags/ahmad-shakir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad Shakir</font></a>, Shaykh Abd al-Razzaaq al-Afeefee, Shaykh Abd al-Rahman al-Wakeel and Shaykh al-Harraas wrote an editorial in Majallat al-Hudaa al-Nabawiyy in 1365H (1946H) entitled, "<i>The <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a>, or the Egyptian Brotherhood, Between Yesterday and Today</i>" (to be published in a future article inshaa'Allaah). These were all scholars of Sunnah and <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and it is a proof that the criticism of the Salafi scholars of today has nothing to do with political circumstances, but is a matter tied to <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> and manhaj.  </blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote><img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/ikhwan-astray-scholars.jpg border="1" style="margin:6px 0px 8px 15px;" width="220" align="right" border=0> A newspaper editorial is doing the rounds currently in all the major Arabic newspapers. "<i>Jamaa'aat (politically motivated and/or religious organized groups) do not have a basis in the (action) of the Salaf</i>" is a introductory headline and then we read, "<b>Scholars: Jaamaa'at al-Ikhwaan Does Not Love the Sunnah and Desires to Misguide Us and Split Us</b>" is the major headline.     <P>
In another editorial in al-Ahram newspaper the article to the right is summarized with what follows below:    <P>
A number of Saudi scholars have emphasized that the group of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> "<i>do not love Ahl al-Sunnah</i>", calling for non-acceptance of this group because it "<i>desires to split us and their goals is (attaining) power</i>." And the Scholars also emphasized in  explicit remarks made to the Saudi newspaper "al-Madeenah" published on its internet website on Thursday that "<i>the group of al-Ikhwan does not have any foundational basis from the Salaf of this nation and they expend effors and aid each other so as to reach, through one path or another, to (political) leadership</i>." And the Scholars indicated that "<i>from the manifestations of this group and its principles is that they block (prevent) the intellects of their followers from listening to speech that opposes their methodology</i>." And the newspaper quoted from the Shaykh, Doctor Saalih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan, member of the Committee of the Major Scholars when he was asked, "Do these groups enter into the seventy-two destroyed sects?" His response, "<i>Yes, everyone, from those who ascribe to Islam, who opposes Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah in da'wah or <a href='tags/aqidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>aqidah</font></a> or in anything from the foundations of eemaan, then he enters into the seventy-two sects</i>." And from his side, the Shaykh, Doctor, Salih bin Muhammad al-Luhaydaan, member of the Committe of the Major Scholars, said, "<i>The Ikhwaan and Jamaa'at at-Tableegh are not from the people of sound methodologies, and all of these groups and labels (they assume) do not have any basis from the Salaf of this Ummah</i>." And from what was said by the Shaykh, Doctor, Saalih bin Abd al-Azeez Aal al-Shaykh, Minister of Islamic Affairs and  Da'wah and Guidance Endowments, "<i>As for the group of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a>, then the from the greatest manifestations of da'wah with them is concealment, secrecy, changing colours (i.e. changing, views, opinions, allegiances and so on), seeking closeness to whomever they believe will benefit them, and not revealing the true reality of their affair</i>."</blockquote>    <P>
