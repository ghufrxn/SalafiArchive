<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq</b> is an <u>Egyptian Ikhwani</u> who moved to Kuwait in the 1960s whereupon he began to preach his doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> and the Ikhwani methodologies he was nurtured upon in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>. As his da'wah developed, it was directed at bringing the ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> (takfir, haakimiyyah) and <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> (political activism, party politics) to a Salafi audience, and this was largely achieved in the 1980s through the organization of <b>Jam'iyyah Ihyaa al-Turaath</b>. However, when critiques were made of him in the early to mid 1990s, and when he got slapped down hard by the major Scholars for innovating into the deen of Allaah, he went somewhat undercover and the Jam'iyyah feigned non-attachment to him. In this series we will look at the refutations of Shaykh Abd al-Azeez bin Baz against some of the Ikhwani poison that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq was pushing into the ranks of the Salafis. The Shaykh wrote a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq after six of his books and one cassette were given to the Shaykh. All of these six books comprised elements of Ikhwani methodologies, and the cassette contained revilement against Salafi scholars.  </blockquote></div> <P>




<p><blockquote>In the Shaykh's fataawaa compilation (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1605;&#1580;&#1605;&#1608;&#1593; &#1601;&#1578;&#1575;&#1608;&#1609; &#1608;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1605;&#1578;&#1606;&#1608;&#1593;&#1577;</span>), there is a critique of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq on numerous issues of manhaj. Here is one of those points (8/242):    <P>
<div align=center><img src=../ikhwanis.com/assets/images/binbaz-arak-03.png width="540" border=0></div>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../ikhwanis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>Secondly:</b> You mentioned in your book "Khutoot Ra'eesiyyah Li Ba'ath al-Ummah al-Islaamiyyah" (Important Steps to Revive the Islamic Ummah) pp. 72-73 whose text is:" In a general sense, there is no place (role, space) in our Arabic and Islamic nations (states) for the Shari'ah except in relation to some of what is referred to as personal situations. But as for economic dealings, political laws and laws pertaining to states, then all of our (Arabic and Islamic) states, without exception, are submissive to the legislation of the West or the East. Likewise the laws pertaining to crimes pertaining to character and prescribed injunctions, they are imported, invented..."    <P>
This generalization is not correct, for Saudiyyah, by Allaah's praise, judges by the Shari'ah in relation to its subjects, it establishes the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> hudood (prescribed injunctions), and <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> lawcourts are set up in all parts of the kingdom. It is not infallible, neither it and nor other states. It has reached me that the ruler of Brunei has ordered with judging to the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a> in all matters and in all circumstances. Hence, it is obligatory to recant from this expression, and to announce this (openly) in the local newspapers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. And if you had expressed (elaborated) more then the subject would have been appropriate due it being the case overwhelmingly. We ask Allaah to grant guidance and success for us and you.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> You have to bear in mind when reading this that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq was the same person who spread the category of <u>Tawhid al-Haakimiyyah</u> as an innovated fourth category of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> for which he was very harshly slapped down by the clarifications of the Scholars in which a person speaking with this was described as an ignoramus and an innovator (see   <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?szskl>here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?lkrtj>here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?nspvn>here</a>, <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?tjxlr>here</a> and <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?pmcwq>here</a>). Thus, what we see here in the speech of this Ikhwani innovator is in reality the <a href='tags/haakimiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haakimiyyah</font></a> of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> on account which all governments and states (without exception) are declared disbelievers because they do not judge entirely by the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, and then making the establishment of the rule, top down, to be the greatest goal of the da'wah. This is great deviation from the methodology of the Prophets in da'wah to Allaah and it is the way of <b>Hassan al-Banna, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>, Abu A'laa Mawdudi, Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</b> and others. For this reason, you will see in the various books written by Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaaliq which are the subject of criticism by Shaykh Ibn Baz and other books he wrote, expressions of the ideas and methodologies of those <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>. The primary target of these people are the Gulf states, and thus whether by <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> (peaceful or otherwise), demonstrations, rallies, open demands for justice and equality (the way of the Marxists, Socialists, Freemasons) party politics, entry into democracy, coups or in some cases, taking gradual, incremental control by infiltrating educational and other government institutions, they aim to seek power through whatever means is appropriate in whatever nation they are operating in and where the climate is suitable for that particular method.   </blockquote> <P>
