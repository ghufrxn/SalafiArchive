Well, the reality is, the article is FILLED with evidence, it proofs with SAHIH narrations that Ali (ra) opposed to major (the ESSENCE) beliefs of the extremist Shias throughout history:

(quote from article)

1) Ibn Saba was the first to display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and the Companions and would free himself from them. And he said that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so (just as the Rafidha today claim). Ali wanted to KILL him for that (!) only due to the protests of the people he expelled him instead i.e.(punished him nevertheless). This has been confirmed by Al-Naubakhti, Al-Kashi and (Saad Ibn Abdallah) Al-Qummi.

2) Ibn Saba’ was also the first to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers (Takfeer Al-Sahaba). This is another admission by Shia scholars (not ‘Umayyads’) that cannot be dismissed that easily.

These are not &#039;assumptions&#039; my dear, these are FACTS, Ali (ra) was a Muslim, Sunni, he had Sunni beliefs, he defended the Shaykhayn (ra), in fact he was SHOCKED when he was informed that someone HATES the Shaykhayn in the name of &#039;loving Ali&#039; (EXACTLY what you lot do!), and he chased the likes of you in the past, declaring himself (Ali) INNOCENT of your hatred and grudge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/30/ibn-saba-the-jew-the-spiritual-father-of-the-rafidha-an-unquestionable-truth/#comment-2477&quot;&gt;Meesam&lt;/a&gt;.

You haven&#039;t read the article carefully, again the name of Paulus was not mentioned why, if you had a brain you would know why. The author used SAULUS the pagan, the original name of Paul, this is because only WE as Muslims (and others who oppose Christ-worship) believe that it wasn&#039;t a holy God-fearing man named Paulus, who apparently converted to Christianity, who was responsible for the spread of Christianity, rather we believe that Saulus always stayed Saulus, a PAGAN who distorted Christianity, Now do the Christians believe that? OF COURSE not, they don&#039;t believe that a PAGAN named Saulus distorted their religion and this is what the article above is telling you, this is why the name of Paulus was not even mentioned ONCE yet YOU mention Paulus! The flaw lies with YOU not with the article. You even insert WORDS that the author never used, shows your bias.

As for the Shaykhan (Allah is well pleased with them), then they corrupted nothing, according to the SAHIH narrations of the Ahl Al-Bait:

http://youpuncturedtheark.wordpress.com/category/nature-of-relationship-between-ahlebayt-and-sahaba/


&quot;specially 2nd one corrupted the religion of Muhammad (saww) by entering the religion because he couldn’t do it fro outside, and this can be supported by the fact that before converting he was one of the greatest enemies of Islam&quot;

What a &#039;great&#039; support! Pure bias! In fact being an enemy of Islam or the worst Kafir THEN converting to Islam is a merit because the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and sahaba) said:

Those among you who were best in Jahiliyyah, are the best among you in Islam, if they attain religious understanding.)&#039;&#039; Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in several places of his Sahih

And of course all sins are forgiven when entering Islam:

proof:

‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas was a mushrik (polytheist, idol-worshipper), a sinner and an enemy of Allaah. He said: “When Allaah put the love of Islam into my heart, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to pledge my allegiance to him. He stretched out his hand towards me, but I said, ‘I will not pledge allegiance to you, O Messenger of Allaah, until you forgive me my previous sins.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, ‘O ‘Amr, do you not know that Islam wipes out whatever sins came before it.’”
(Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 17159) 

So you are the biased person, as all Shias are who only see a number of Hadith that put the Sahaba in bad light (well, they were human after all, made mistakes) but forget that overall they are praised, especially the Shaykhayn and the major Sahaba of the Muhajireen and Ansar. And the Ahl Al-Bait themselves PRAISED Omar (RA) in NUMEROUS Sahih narration you can only reject because your DESIRE rejectsit, not science (ilm al-Hadith and Rijal):

http://youpuncturedtheark.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/part-6-nature-of-relationship-between-ahlebaytra-and-umarra/

And ironically the people who introduced BLATANT deviant beliefs into your distorted version of &#039;Islam&#039; are YOUR scholars, the Safavids, here AMPLE evidence:

http://sonsofsunnah.com/2012/07/25/the-reviver-of-zorastrian-majoosi-elements-under-the-cover-of-tashayyu-shiism/

http://sonsofsunnah.com/2011/04/16/the-dajjaal-the-shia-mahdi-the-opiate-of-the-masses/

Clear-cut Majoosi and Jewish elements, yet you talk about the great Shaykhayn?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/30/ibn-saba-the-jew-the-spiritual-father-of-the-rafidha-an-unquestionable-truth/#comment-2476&quot;&gt;Meesam&lt;/a&gt;.

You are one ignorant, of course it is obvious that a Shia historian like Al-Nawbakhti does not literally mean that he HIMSELF beliefs in the accusation that Shiism (its essence) was created by a Jew! Nevertheless, me as an Ex-Shia understand this logic very well, namely that even a major Shia historian (who lived in the time of Sunni Imam Al-Tabari) could not be as stupid as your scholars (amongst them Maraji&#039;, most propagandists in the west and even Yasser Al-Habib!) who completely reject his EXISTENCE! Now this is fishy! As for the attributes of Allah, well mate, you the Rafidis who are nothing but Jahmis must have a problem with the Qur&#039;an too because most of these attributes can be found in the Qur&#039;an (which you believe in I guess ...). Like the following: 

. And on the Day of Resurrection, the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His RIGHT Hand. Glorified is He, and High is He above all that they associate as partners with Him!&quot;

(39:67)

Now I know that Shias are so BIASED that if it wasn&#039;t for the reference (Qur&#039;an) they would surely believe that this is a &#039;fabricated hadith by Abu Hurayrah&#039;. Well, it&#039;s the Qur&#039;an it even talks about a RIGHT hand! Now if you say, well we Shias interpret it differently then it won&#039;t change that this &#039;apparent anthropomorphism&#039; is in the Qur&#039;an! Of course it not Tajseem (anthropomorphism) at all, it&#039;s just your Jahmi minds who see body limbs (in the Sunnah and in the Qu&#039;ran!), whereas true Muslims see the attributes of Allah, accepting them without how and DON&#039;T comparing them to the creation, that&#039;s the right religion.

As for fasting on Ashoora, well, that&#039;s PURE Ahl Al-Bait Sunnah and it&#039;s the Jewish Rafidah (who break their fasts at nights like Jews) who have abondened this Sunnah due to their HATRED:

http://gift2shias.com/2012/11/17/agreement-on-fasting-ashura-except-by-the-extremist-shia/

Clear-cut evidence that fasting on Ashoora is a Sunnah by the Ahl Al-Bait:

It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, “The foundation of al-Rafd is taken from the Jews.”

I think you need to keep your bias aside and read this statement again, Naubakhti is not accepting that Shias come from Ibn Saba, He is clearly saying that because of some of these beliefs of Abdullah Ibn Saba “THOSE WHO OPPSED SHIA SAID that the foundation of al Rafd is taken from jews”.

Are you joking or are you just too dumb to get it??

Having some similar views doesnt mean direct association, When your books talk about Allah having hands and fingers and legs, and Allah moving up and down the heaven (Nauzobillah) and when you accuse the Prophet (saws) of taking the Fast of Ashura from the Jews, Should i conclude that you are also from the Jews?? actually there is more similarity between jewish beliefs and your beliefs.

Comon man, be fair, We DON&#039;T accept he that you deviant Shias are sincere in your beliefs! There was not a single lie so far so you better don&#039;t lie, you don&#039;t even bring a SINGLE proof, all you said so far is your personal opinion whereas the article is FILLED with proofs.]]></description>

<p>Comon man, be fair, We DON&#8217;T accept he that you deviant Shias are sincere in your beliefs! There was not a single lie so far so you better don&#8217;t lie, you don&#8217;t even bring a SINGLE proof, all you said so far is your personal opinion whereas the article is FILLED with proofs.</p>

I&#039;ve read the article, no where it is stated that Shiism emerged in the third century! Although it is a truth! Mild Shiism, political Shiism started during the Fitan of Jamal and Siffeen, later on it mutated into Rafdh to the point that Rafidism today is full of Rafdh AND Shirkiyat all in the NAME of the Ahl Al-Bayt.]]></description>
