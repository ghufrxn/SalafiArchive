What&#039;s baseless is your claim that Mu`awiyah killed `A&#039;ishah and that he ordered Ibn Muljam to assassinate `Ali. As for the Fitnah we say may Allah forgive them their mistake and reward them for their intentions. Abu Lu&#039;lu&#039;ah however was not a man with good intentions.

We suggest you quit seeking knowledge from random blogs and forum posts, the writers are often unqualified.]]></description>
