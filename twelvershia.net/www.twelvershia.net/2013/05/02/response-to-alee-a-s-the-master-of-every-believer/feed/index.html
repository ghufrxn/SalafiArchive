They stopped in the desert at an oasis in order to rest and drink and replenish. During their stay, the Prophet (saw) addressed some complains raised against `Ali, so the Prophet (saw) reminded people of caring for his household in general after his death and he (saw) tied `Ali&#039;s love to his own by saying &quot;Whoever takes me as beloved close friend, the he must love `Ali and take him as close friend.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know the authenticity of a hadith is very important. But, at the end of the day no hadith is 100% correct only the Quran is. Also, another way you can figure out if it&#039;s authentic is by logic and common sense. Would the Prophet(saws) stop in the middle of a desert just to claim Ali(as) is his friend or ally. And if he called Ali(as) to call him as a friend , then why didn&#039;t he do the same for Abu Bakr, Umar, or Uthman. Why specifically Ali(as)?? Think about it.]]></description>
