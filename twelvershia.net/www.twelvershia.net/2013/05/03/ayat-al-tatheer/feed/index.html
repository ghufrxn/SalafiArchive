What does being warned have to do with them being his wives or not?

					<description><![CDATA[If all of the wives of the prophet (pbuh) are included in verse 33:33 as you claim than Allah failed in his mission. Because Aisha and Hafsa get yelled at by Allah in Quran 66-3-5   (Bukhari 7:63:192)
In fact, they were threatened with divorce. So you see brother, they were not cleaned and still remained impure.

					<description><![CDATA[There are no Infallible Imams in Islam. Well this a major claim but what evidence do I have for this. In Islam, we should base our claims, religion on solid base. We have the last revelation of God. So what is better than using the last Revelation of God, Quran, for this? Nothing of course.
Here are the verses taken by Shias to indicate the infallibility of Imams. As you will see this has nothing to do with Infallibility. 
1)	Read the verses and see first the verses before 33:33 and after, who they talk about. Summary, they all talk about Wives of Prophet SAW. There is no second guessing to it.
33:30 O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for Allah.

33:31 But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger, and works righteousness,- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance.

33:32 O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (Allah), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just.

33:33 And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet&#039;s] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification.

وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتِينَ الزَّكَاةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا

33:34 And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom: for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them).

2)	The word purify or “Yutahirakum” is taken by Shia as infallibility. The truth is, this word has nothing to do with infallibility. What is the evidence again for this?
a.	يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلاةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُواْ بِرُؤُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَينِ وَإِن كُنتُمْ جُنُبًا فَاطَّهَّرُواْ وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاء أَحَدٌ مَّنكُم مِّنَ الْغَائِطِ أَوْ لاَمَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَاء فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُم مِّنْهُ مَا يُرِيدُ اللّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ وَلَـكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهَّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ. 

Here is the meaning:

5:6 O YOU who have attained to faith! When you are about to pray, wash your face, and your hands and arms up to the elbows, and pass your [wet] hands lightly over your head, and [wash] your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state. requiring total ablution, purify yourselves. [But if you are ill, or are travelling, or have just satisfied a want of nature, or have cohabited with a woman, and can find no water-then take resort to pure dust, passing therewith lightly over your face and your hands. God does not want to impose any hardship on you, but wants to make you pure, and to bestow upon you the full measure of His blessings, so that you might have cause to be grateful.

إِذْ يُغَشِّيكُمُ النُّعَاسَ أَمَنَةً مِّنْهُ وَيُنَزِّلُ عَلَيْكُم مِّن السَّمَاء مَاء لِّيُطَهِّرَكُم بِهِ وَيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمْ رِجْزَ الشَّيْطَانِ وَلِيَرْبِطَ عَلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتَ بِهِ الأَقْدَامَ

8:11 [Remember how it was] when He caused inner calm to enfold you, as an assurance from Him, and sent down upon you water from the skies, so that He might purify you thereby and free you from Satan&#039;s unclean whisperings  and strengthen your hearts and thus make firm your steps.

Note : “لِّيُطَهِّرَكُم” and “لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ” Look these words in 8:11 and the end of 33:33.

As you see, especially 8:11 that God used the same words he used in 33:33. Can we take all the Companions who were in Badr were also Infallibles from 8:11? Of course we know this is not take case. Similarly 33:33 has nothing to do with infallibility of Ahlul Bayt in short. This is beside the point who are the Ahlul Bayt.
 
3)	Lastly, Who are Ahlul bayt “أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ“ according to Quran? 
God used Alhal bayt in three places in the Quran. Here are the three places.
a.	وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتِينَ الزَّكَاةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا
b.	قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ
c.	وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَاصِحُونَ
 
English:
a.	33:33 And abide quietly in your homes, and do not flaunt your charms as they used to flaunt them in the old days of pagan ignorance; and be constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues, and pay heed unto God and His Apostle: for God only wants to remove from you all that might be loathsome, O you members of the [Prophet’s] household, and to purify you to utmost purity
b.	11:73 Answered [the messengers]: &quot;Dost thou deem it strange that God should decree what He wills? [105] The grace of God and His blessings be upon you, O people of this house! Verily, ever to be praised, sublime is He!&quot;
c.	28:12 And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, &quot;Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?&quot;

In short, all three include or talk about women folk of the house. So people who claim this is specific to Fatuma, Ali, Hassan, and Hussain RA are totally mistaken. 
Sahabs were human beings with no extra powers. Some used to drink, some fell on Zina or other sins, from the accounts we know, because simple they were human beings. What we do know though is that they were the best of Mankind like God said. It is not me who is praising them but God. Look the following verses.
3:110 YOU ARE indeed the best community that has ever been brought forth for [the good of] mankind: you enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid the doing of what is wrong, and you believe in God. Now if the followers of earlier revelation had attained to [this kind of] faith, it would have been for their own good; [but only few] among them are believers, while most of them are iniquitous.
Who was God talking about here? Primarily them, the Sahaba of the Prophet SAW. God the knower of the past, present and the future.
8:74 And they who have attained to faith, and who have forsaken the domain of evil and are striving hard in God&#039;s cause, as well as those who shelter and succour [them]-it is they, they who are truly believers! Forgiveness of sins awaits them, and a most excellent sustenance.
Who are the best believers? According to God, them.	
48:18 INDEED, well-pleased was God with the believers when they pledged their allegiance unto thee [O Muhammad] under that tree, for He knew what was in their hearts; and so He bestowed inner peace upon them from on high, and rewarded them with [the glad tiding of] a victory soon to come
More:
48:29 Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.
3:103 And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you – when you were ENEMIES and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, BROTHERS. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be GUIDED. 
Could you believe a people God said I will make them brothers become enemies with swords in their belies moments after prophet SAW died? You have option to either believe God or unsubstantiated Shia sources that were written hundreds of years later.
 8:62 It is He who supported you with His help and with the believers.
Question is did God supported with Prophet Mohamed with believers or Hypocrites? Read Quran and accept what God teach you, you will be GUIDED ones God Willing.
Not only that, But God wants you to do this:
59:8 For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. THOSE ARE TRUTHFUL.
59:9 And [also for] those who were SETTLED in al-Madinah and [adopted] the faith before them. They LOVE those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the SUCCESSFUL.
59:10 And [there is a share for] THOSE WHO CAME AFTER THEM, SAYING, &quot;Our Lord, forgive us and OUR BROTHERS [first and foremost Muhajirin and Anar] who preceded us in faith and PUT NOT in OUR HEARTS [ANY] RESENTMENT TOWARDS those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.&quot;
In other words, forget about having resentment towards them, God wants you, Mumin/Muslim, to make dua for them.
Who was God pleased with more? Me, you, or others in this age or the ones God mentioned above? If you believe Allah and you hold Quran as the word of God, then you get the answer from the Quran. If however this is not the case, then this whole explanation is not for you. This is for Muslims and Mumins.]]></description>

3:103 And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you – when you were ENEMIES and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, BROTHERS. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be GUIDED.<br />
Could you believe a people God said I will make them brothers become enemies with swords in their belies moments after prophet SAW died? You have option to either believe God or unsubstantiated Shia sources that were written hundreds of years later.<br />
 8:62 It is He who supported you with His help and with the believers.<br />
Question is did God supported with Prophet Mohamed with believers or Hypocrites? Read Quran and accept what God teach you, you will be GUIDED ones God Willing.<br />
Not only that, But God wants you to do this:<br />
59:8 For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. THOSE ARE TRUTHFUL.<br />
59:9 And [also for] those who were SETTLED in al-Madinah and [adopted] the faith before them. They LOVE those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul &#8211; it is those who will be the SUCCESSFUL.<br />
59:10 And [there is a share for] THOSE WHO CAME AFTER THEM, SAYING, &#8220;Our Lord, forgive us and OUR BROTHERS [first and foremost Muhajirin and Anar] who preceded us in faith and PUT NOT in OUR HEARTS [ANY] RESENTMENT TOWARDS those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.&#8221;<br />
In other words, forget about having resentment towards them, God wants you, Mumin/Muslim, to make dua for them.<br />
Who was God pleased with more? Me, you, or others in this age or the ones God mentioned above? If you believe Allah and you hold Quran as the word of God, then you get the answer from the Quran. If however this is not the case, then this whole explanation is not for you. This is for Muslims and Mumins.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[@zaheer, after everything you just wrote have you even read the ayats of surah ahzab from 30-33 does that soud like a warning to you or Advice and glad tidings of the pleasure of their Lord. So stupidly as though your comments sound you axed your own foot.  As for ahl kisa hadith then as mentioned our mother umme salma was included in ahlul bayt and the episode of kissa read the hadith. it is sunna hadith science and compilation in sunni works let us do the commentary you go bring ahl kissa hadith with the matn text in a shia classical work with a sahih shia isnad then you may discuss the tafsir of it. As for mubahila yes it is a unique honour for ahlul bayt and we narrate all their merits without bias, and as the verse instructs those of most closeness eg relatives and indeed dear loved ones were taken for the task. How that serves a shia purpose is beyond me because both sahaba and ahlul bayt have unique merits exclusive to themselves. You shia just love causing fitna as you did in jamal in siffeen and with your betrayal of sayyiduna imam hassan and Imam hussain (ra).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any person who has any intelligence and is honest irrespective of religion or sect will say the warning part is for those wives who committed those sins and the world knows through narrations and history that this is about Ayesha and Hafsah and they are definitely out of the fold of Ahlebayt . Ahlebayt includes only the Itrate Rasool (s) comprising of the five Ali (a) Fatemah (sa) Hasan (a) Husain (a) and the Rasool himself make the pajatan who when assembled under the Kissa e Yamiani , the verse was revealed . It was Janab Umme Salamah&#039;s house and she was the mosr favorite wife but as a fundamedntal rule she was not covered in the Kissacanopy ,though was very highly praised and was given great tidings. 
Even in the mobahela though there was an open invitation but Rasool e Kareem(s) took only Fatemah among ladies, Ali (a) as his Nafs, Hasnain (a s) as his children . Why in this the sahabas and wives were excluded . So only the Itrat for whom the 
Aya e tatheer was revealed  are the Ahlebayt , definitely NOT  the wives .]]></description>
