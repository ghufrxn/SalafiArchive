					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/16/the-prophet-saws-only-gets-angry-for-fatima-ra/#comment-59&quot;&gt;Roshanara Khan&lt;/a&gt;.

Salam `Aleykum,

A narration from abu Musa from the Prophet (SAWS):

أحل الذهب والحرير للإناث من أمتي وحرم على ذكورها
&quot;Gold and silk have been made permissible for the females of my nation but forbidden for the males.&quot;

Also it is allowed for men who have a special skin condition to wear natural silk, and wearing clothes which are partly silk is apparently allowed.

As for the reasons for forbidding it, I&#039;ve heard several: it is said because the messenger (SAWS) wanted the men to toughen up because blessings do not last, it is also said because silk is mainly worn by women and men must not act like women, it is also said that it is a sign of effeminacy and it is known today that homosexual men wear a lot of silk, and it is said that it is forbidden for men in this life because it shall be their clothing in the after-life just like gold is allowed in the after-life, and finally it is said that this is because silk is a sign of extravagance and pride...

related narrations:

`Umar ibn al-Khattab said, &quot;The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) forbade the wearing of silk, except for the area of two fingers, or three, or four.&quot; [Muslim]


Ibn `Abbas said, &quot;The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) only prohibited the wearing of a garment of uniform silk. As for a silken badge, or the warp of a garment, there is no objection to it.&quot; [Abu Dawud]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

Good Article. There is only one thing which I have in my mind that is except for the Hadiths on Hadhrat Aboo Bakr (ra) all other hadiths could also be interpreted as Hadhrat Mohammed (saww) getting angry not for the people but because of acts being committed eg, Imam lengthening of morning prayers harming weak and old people who then avoid morning prayers. Asking about camel means asking unnecessary questions which have no benefit for one&#039;s Iman. Beating of slave would incurred ALLAH&#039;S (SWT) Wrath irrespective of slave being Muslim or non-Muslim.And lastly Prophet hating men wearing silk cloak. I hope you can clear my confusion. Thanks.]]></description>
