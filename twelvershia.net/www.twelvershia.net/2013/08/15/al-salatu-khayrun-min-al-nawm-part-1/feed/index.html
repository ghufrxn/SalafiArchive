					<description><![CDATA[Assalamu Alaykum, WarahmatulLah!
Maa Shaa Allah!
This Forum is indeed very educative, informative! The Forum, blocks all possible ways for Shi&#039;ah to penetrate into our Beautiful Islam. The Shi&#039;ah Evil Intentions toward Muslims and Islam, were Exposed on the Light of Reasons and rooms were not left for doubt and assumption. But it yet blinds those who were blinded by their self-centered egoism. They cannot see the Truth! 
Allah The Most Exalted has spoken The Truth: 

وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّـهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿٨﴾ يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّـهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ ﴿٩﴾ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّـهُ مَرَضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ﴿١٠﴾ وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ ﴿١١﴾ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ﴿١٢﴾ وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿١٣﴾ وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ ﴿١٤﴾ اللَّـهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ ﴿١٥﴾ أُولَـٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ ﴿١٦﴾مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّـهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ ﴿١٧﴾ صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ ﴿١٨﴾

And of the people are some who say, &quot;We believe in Allah and the Last Day,&quot; but they are not believers.

They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.

And when it is said to them, &quot;Do not cause corruption on the earth,&quot; they say, &quot;We are but reformers.&quot;

Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

And when it is said to them, &quot;Believe as the people have believed,&quot; they say, &quot;Should we believe as the foolish have believed?&quot; Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.

And when they meet those who believe, they say, &quot;We believe&quot;; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, &quot;Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.&quot;

And when they meet those who believe, they say, &quot;We believe&quot;; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, &quot;Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.&quot;

Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.

Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.

Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].
[Surah Al-Baqara, 2:8-18]

May Allah let us see the Light of Truth, Under the Teachings and Guidance of Our Beloved Prophet (SAW).

May Allah reward all your efforts and endeavors immensely! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP INTO SHIA BELIEF, AND OPEN MINDEDLY WHEN I WROTE ABOUT SUNNISM I BECAME A MUSLIM.. NO MORE SUNNI OR A SHIA....

&quot;Brother Zaheer husain khan&quot;(Must we always prove our own side with philosophical ways, metaphysically? Or we need to understand well the other side and compare it with our own side with open eyes and mind, keeping in mind that we all are human beings first? Good and bad?) should be more understandable and must go through the concepts of Islam from sources other than Shiasm. Being an Ex Shia I&#039;m fully indebted to &#039;Is your shia friend asking questions?&#039; for my present ideology of Islam.

I, as a Shia used to disrespect the Sahaba&#039;s played a major role in spreading Prophet Mohammed or for that pious matter Maula Ali&#039;s own faith through the World of disbelief with sincerity and dedication.

I, as a Shia always though Maula Ali was the only power and sourse for the spread of Islam and was a staunch Shia(12 ver) but after meeting Dr. Israr Ahmed on my Journalistic visit to Pakistan I was astonished at the Cristal-clear facts I was provided by this great man no more now (May Allah bless his soul). 

He had no enmity with any sect of Islam, and was super knowledgeable. It would be no exaggeration if say he was the most knowledgeable and inspiring man I&#039;ve ever met. Very simple, a paradigm of a perfect Alim. Amazingly was a self taught Alim. 

ANY SHIA WHO WANTS TO GET OUT THIS SHIA SUNNI ENMITY MUST, I SAY, MUST LISTEN TO HIS LECTURES AND READ HIS PROFOUND BOOKS WHICH ARE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH! 

WE ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN IDEOLOGIES, HOWEVER LEFT OR RIGHT, NOT ALLAH!

PEACE TO ALL OUR BROTHER!!!]]></description>
