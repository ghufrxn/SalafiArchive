In the Sahih Hadith, when the Prophet (saw) asked Abu Bakr to give him his daughter `A&#039;ishah in marriage, Abu Bakr said: &quot;How can you marry my daughter if we&#039;re brothers?&quot; He (saw) replied: &quot;This is a brotherhood in religion, your daughter is permissible for me.&quot;]]></description>
