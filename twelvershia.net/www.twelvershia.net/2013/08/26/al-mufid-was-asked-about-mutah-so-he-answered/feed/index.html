					<description><![CDATA[1. All the wives of Imams a.s you have mentioned were slaves, but were freed, trained as Islamic Scholars and married. So he Sheikh Mufid r.a was right in saying that they dod not marry slaves, whereas in Islam there is nothing wrong in marrying Slaves.

2. But thats not the point.....

When you people are out of logic you try to escape with these foolish things, 

What Sheikh Mufid r.a meant is clear, if there is something the Prophet saww and Imams a.s did not do, it doesn&#039;t mean its Haram, let me give another example, they never divorced their wives, so is it haram to divorce too??]]></description>
