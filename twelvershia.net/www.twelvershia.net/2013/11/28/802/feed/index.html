					<description><![CDATA[Verily, those who took the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman have sworn allegiance to me.

Salam `Aleykum,

The verse was revealed on the night of `Arafah, it was a Friday, this was before Ghadir Khum. Which means the religion was completed before `Ali&#039;s so called Imamah, meaning there was no such thing as `Ali&#039;s Imamah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks. Really very informative from Sunni points of views. The websites have been hijacked by these and also Ismaili or Agha Khan people stormed with their narratives, Ordinary muslim get confused after reading all this. You have done great service to clear doubts and confusions in an elaborate manner.

One thing, I however, found missing. At one place it is written, that on this day Allah revealed that today he had completed the religion i.e., on Ghadeer Qom,

In your comments, I assume you have missed to answer on this. I would be grateful if you please advise Shaane Nazool, of Aya Sharifa, &quot;Al Youmo, Akmalto Lakum Deenakum, Wa atmamto Alaikum Naimati, Wa Raziato Lakumul Islama Deena&quot;.

Would you please also shed light on which occasion and when this Ayarth Sharifa was revealed.

Thanks.]]></description>

I see.... Well obviously there are disagreements on regards to The imams, as we have Ismailis and Zaydis and 12vers. I wondering of suggesting that you guys also refute a couple of Yasir Al Habib&#039;s videos as well. That tire head is a pretty controversial figure]]></description>

That would be an interesting research. I am pretty sure that the answer is: Yes. 
However, the Shias have a much harder time proving the appointment of each of their Imams one by one. ]]></description>

These are fabricated reports invented by Shia narrators in the past and attributed to important Islamic personalities such as Ibn Mas`oud (ra) or Ibn `Abbas (ra). If you review the history of these two personalities, you will see that they never believed in such a thing. However, the Shia will still attribute such lies to them. As for the authenticity of such reports, they are most certainly lies by consensus of experts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Asalam alaikum ikhwan. I&#039;m of student of knowledge and I often come across your site. You quoted two works &quot;[Ibn Babawayh has narrated that `Abdullah bin Masud said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (S): “Who will give you the funeral bath?” He replied: “Every prophet is given the funeral bath by his successor.” I asked: “Who is your successor, O Messenger of Allah (S).” He replied: “`Ali Ibn Abi Talib.”]
Source: Hayat-ul-Quloub.
As for ibn `Abbas (ra) they narrate from the Prophet (saw) that he entered upon him when he was in his last sickness and asked:
إذا كان ما نعوذ بالله منه فإلى من؟ فأشار إلى علي، فقال: إلى هذا فإنه مع الحق والحق معه، ثم يكون من بعده أحد عشر إماماً
[“If what we fear happens then who receives it (The leadership)?” So he pointed to `Ali and said: “To this one, he is with the truth and after him will be eleven leaders.”]
Source: I`lam al-Wara 36, Bihar al-Anwar 36/300.

Does this mean ALi Ra was indeed the successor of Muhammad SAW? Are these what you quoted authentic?]]></description>
