					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2013/11/14/response-to-tabarra-cursing-the-enemies-of-ahlulbayt-as-is-the-sunnah-of-ibn-tamiyah-too/#comment-19201&quot;&gt;Behrooz&lt;/a&gt;.

Ibn Taymiyyah&#039;s stance in brief, is that he is a legitimate ruler but he ruled with force, he was not a Kafir but he wasn&#039;t a companion or from pious friends of Allah, we do not like him but we do not curse him, he is responsible for what happened to Husayn and in al-Harrah because he did not deal with events wisely.

Ibn Taymiyyah says also about the direct killers of Husayn such as Shamir and ibn Ziyad:

وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَتَلَ &quot; الْحُسَيْنَ &quot; أَوْ أَعَانَ عَلَى قَتْلِهِ أَوْ رَضِيَ بِذَلِكَ فَعَلَيْهِ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ ؛ لَا يَقْبَلُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ صَرْفًا وَلَا عَدْلًا

&quot;As for the one who killed al-Husayn and the one who helped kill him or was pleased by this, then may the curse of Allah, his angels and all humanity be upon him; Allah shall not accept his worship or excuse.&quot;]]></description>
