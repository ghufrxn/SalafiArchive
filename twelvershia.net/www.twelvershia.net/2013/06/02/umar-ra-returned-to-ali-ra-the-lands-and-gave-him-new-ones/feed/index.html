If your asking about the land of Sadaqah, he never gave it to him, he only placed him and al-`Abbas in control of it, they benefit from it and divide it among the poor as Rasul-Allah (saw) did.

`Umar gave `Ali a land in Yanbu`, this was a gift. He also gave him a land from what was later divided in Khaybar, `Umar divided some lands there between the fighters who conquered it after he expelled the Jews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[why should Umar ( ra ) give the land to Ali (ra) . he should not give it as Abu bakr did not give. For what reason did he give land which is considered as sadaqa

Bukhari :: Book 4 :: Volume 53 :: Hadith 325 
Narrated &#039;Aisha: 

(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah &#039;s Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah&#039;s Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah&#039;s Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &#039;Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).&quot; Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#039;s Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah&#039;s Apostle. 

She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah&#039;s Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, &quot;I will not leave anything Allah&#039;s Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet&#039;s tradition, then I would go astray.&quot; (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet&#039;s property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to &#039;Ali and &#039;Abbas, but he withheld the properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, &quot;These two properties are the Sadaqa which Allah&#039;s Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted to the ruler.&quot; (Az-Zuhrl said, &quot;They have been managed in this way till today.&quot;)]]></description>
