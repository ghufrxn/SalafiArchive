					<description><![CDATA[Salam alaikum brother 
EXCELLENT work on the ghadir khumm event analysis and demolishing the myth of the 12ers, and thank you for mentioning that Suleiman b Sured ( RA) was a companion and supporter of Ali ( RA) that made me cring when 12ers dissociate themselves from all supporters of Ali while claiming to be the only &quot;true shia&quot;
Regarding Ghadir, I was confused by 2 thing 
1-Attiyah b Sa&#039;d is daeef ? isn&#039;t he the companion of Ibn Abbbas ( RA) who was flogged by Muhammad b qasim ? he is mentioned in Tahdeeb by ibn Hajar 
2-Does the companion   Bara b Azib (RA) feature in any Ghadeer narration ?]]></description>
