al-Salamu `Aleykum,

Dear brother the sources are mentioned in the PDF file, it is found in many of our books, I just listed SOME of the books in my research so as to avoid repetition, but if you must source it simply say:
Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal.

That would be sufficient, if they ask for a scan or page number or whatnot, that is only a waste of time, they do this to waste your time so don&#039;t bother with them. The vast majority of them don&#039;t know Arabic nor do they own the books.]]></description>

Brothers who looking after on this website i ask to reward you for this great effort. Regarding the article mention above it is very informative but if you mention the reference of books from where you quote these narrations it help us to refute shia believe regarding clashes between khulafa 3 r.a &#038; ali r.a  shia.]]></description>
