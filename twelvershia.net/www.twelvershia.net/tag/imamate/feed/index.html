<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding Imamate in the Early Shia Society</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following article takes an in-depth look at aspects of Imamate in light of the understanding displayed by early Shia society. The time period that is placed under the microscope is the pre-Ghaybah era in which early Shias flocked in search of their Imams. The article aims to debunk myths about Imamate and to display to readers the sort of confusion that early Shias found themselves when it came to identifying the Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will only be using <u>authentic</u> narrations from Shia sources in this article.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Number of Imams</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Timing of Appointments</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor</strong></span></li>

<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Number of Imams</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first misconception that we will find many Shias falling into is the assumption that Shias were known as Twelvers early on. Though, those that are familiar with the splits among the Shia communities of old, will be aware that this was not the case at all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The early Shias were known as Al-Qat’eeyah. They are those that affirmed that Musa Al-Kathim passed away, unlike many other Shias that disagreed and believed that he was still alive. The name Al-Qat’eeyah was recorded in the books of Sa’ad bin Abdullah Al-Asha’ri and Al-Nawbakhti (p. 86) and was also recorded by Sunnis historians like Al-Malti (Al-Tanbeeh p. 26), Abu Hasan Al-Ash’ari (Maqalaat p. 34), and Al-Shihristani (Al-Milal p. 111).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The name Al-Qat’eeyah came into being after the passing of Musa Al-Kathim in the year 183 AH.  This suggests that the name: Itha Ashariyya, is a very late name. It is not possible to suggest that they were known as Twelvers before Musa Al-Kathim, since if that was the case, there wouldn’t be a reason for a name change in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By returning to specific narrations, we find that the Qat’eeyah themselves clearly did not know how many Imams there would be. Abu Jareer Al-Qummi asks Al-Redha if his father Al-Kathim went into Ghaibah, suggesting that he did not believe that the Imams were twelve, but they could have been seven. (Al-Kulayni 1/237)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration, Ayoub bin Nuh, one of the close companions of Al-Redha, after seeing that people have all pledged their allegiance to Al-Redha, came to the assumption that he was the Mahdi. (Al-Kulayni 1/210)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, the very suggestion that the Mahdi is the seventh or eighth Imam shows that early Shias were not familiar with the belief that the Imams had to be twelve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another aspect that should be taken into consideration is that according to early Shia narrations, the Mahdi should have come much earlier, way before the time of the twelfth Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Baqir said, “Allah had deemed the year 70 as the time, but when Al-Hussain was killed He was so angered that He delayed it until the year 140. When we told you of this, you spread it the secret, and so Allah kept the time away from us.” (Al-Kulayni 1/229)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ja’afar Al-Sadiq said, “The time was going to come in the year 140, but we spoke of this to you, and you have spread this, so Allah delayed it.” (Al-Nu’mani p. 303)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The previous two narrations are clear that the “time” was going to come way before the appointment of all twelve of the Imams. So it makes no sense that the Shias would be referred to as Twelvers in the first place.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Timing of Appointments </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It goes without saying that if the number of the Imams weren’t known, it is only natural to believe that their identities weren’t known either. There are several cases in which we find some of the top companions of the Imams being completely unaware of who the next Imam was. This is clear evidence that the full list of who the Imams were was not known to anyone. According to a lengthy narration, the Prophet – peace be upon him – made it known who some of Ahlulbayt were (i.e. Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain), but did not list all the Imams. (Al-Kafi 1/172)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first and most straightforward evidence that affirms this is that whole list of Imams was not available to the Imams themselves was that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, in two separate narrations, says that the Imam does not pass away until Allah tells him who the next Imam will be. (Al-Kulayni 1/166) The narration is clear that this information was not privy to him from the start of the Imamate, but rather, it becomes known to him towards the end of his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is even clearer in the narration of Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar, in which Ja’afar Al-Sadiq tells him to accept Musa Al-Kathim as his next Imam, and that Ja’afar was ordered by Allah to not tell anyone before Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar. (Al-Kulayni 1/188)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also find that Ali Al-Hadi when asked about who the next Imam was, he told his student, Isma’eel bin Mihran, to not fear for his safety. Years later, when asked again, he said, “Now you may fear for my safety, the matter (of Imamate) is to my son Ali.” (Al-Kulayni 1/198)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another fact that needs to be taken into consideration is that some of the top students of the Imams were not aware of the whole list of Imams. Not only that but some of them were not aware of who the Imam of their time was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zurarah bin A’ayan, the top Shia scholar during the time of Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, according to Al-Najashi (p. 175), did not know the identity of the next Imam. When Ja’afar died, his son Abdullah sat in his position and started to teach the Shias. Zurarah then sent his son Ubaid in order to find out who the Imam was. Zurarah passed away before accepting Musa bin Ja’afar as the Imam. (See Al-Kashshi p. 117)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A similar scenario is that of Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Fadhal, who died in the year 224 AH. According to a narration, he accepted Al-Kathim while upon his deathbed. When asked about his allegiance to Abdullah bin Ja’afar, who Ibn Fadhal previous assumed was the Imam, he said, “We looked in the books and found nothing about Abdullah.” (Rijal Al-Kashshi p. 400) It is important to note that Ibn Fadhal, who was considered to be one of the most pious Shias of his time, spent his whole life following a false Imam without evidence, nor was he aware of the appointment of Al-Kathim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Salim bin Abi Hafsa, a Zaidi, asked Abu Ubaida Al-Hatha’ who his Imam was, Abu Ubaida answered, “My Imams are the Aal of Mohammad.” Salim responded, “I see that you do not know your Imam.” (See Al-Kashshi p. 172)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In an even stranger narration, Hanan bin Sadeer asked Al-Baqir if Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah was an Imam. (Ali bin Babawaih p. 193) This narration suggests that even followers of the Imams were not necessarily aware of the identities of the previous Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though it is common knowledge that the Imamate is inherited through direct descendants, during the 3<sup>rd</sup> century, we find that Mohammad bin Isma’eel bin Bazee’ asked Al-Redha as to whether the successor of the Imam can be an uncle or a brother, which means that he wasn’t even aware that Imamate was exclusive to sons. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 191)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very important to be aware that the Twelver community of the fourth century was aware of the ignorance of the early Shias, which caused some of them to completely reject the notion that there are clear textual evidences for the appointment. (Al-Khazzaz p. 61)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very important to keep in mind that the Imams did not share the full list of Imams. When asked, they would either not provide them with the name of their successor, or they would only mention the name of the very next Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Ja’afar Al-Sadiq gives instructions to Abdula’ala bin A’yan, the brother of Zurarah, of the procedures to identifying the Imam when the previous Imam passes away. Al-Sadiq, instead of providing him with a list of names of the Imams, provides him with the procedures. (Al-Kulayni 1/236) The same occurs with Mohammad bin Muslim Al-Thaqafi, one of Ja’afar’s closest companions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 225)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, as explained in another <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/01/07/identifying-infallible-imam/">article</a>, the Imams often provided their followers with signs, instead of a list of whom the successive Imams were going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another example is when Ja’afar Al-Sadiq was asked by Nasr bin Qaboos about who the next Imam was, he said that it would be Musa Al-Kathim. Then, when Musa was asked, Nasr asked him, and he said it would be Al-Redha. (Al-Kashshi p.322) Neither Al-Sadiq nor Al-Kathim provided Nasr with a list of Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should also be known that those that accepted the Imams of their times do not show any knowledge of who the next succeeding Imams are going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amr bin Huraith for instance, meets up with Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, and lists out his beliefs. He then mentions his acceptance of the six Imams. Ja’afar does not fill him in on the rest of the Imams, but rather, confirms his statements. (Al-Kashshi p. 299)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same occurs with Mansoor bin Hazim (Al-Kashishi p. 301), Khalid Al-Bajali (Al-Kashshi p. 302), and Al-Hasan bin Ziyad (Al-Kashshi p. 303).</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Secrecy of the Imamate</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another matter that led to the confusion surrounding the Imamate of the Imams was that their lives were enshrouded in secrecy. The Imams was very secretive in nature. There are even cases in which the Imams would tell their students not to teach of their Imamate. This led to the ignorance of their students in regards to the identities of the Imams and the appointment of their successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When asked about his Imamate, Ja’afar Al-Sadiq completely denies that he is an Imam when approached by two Zaidi men. They then tell him that they heard this from some of pious followers in Al-Kufa. Al-Sadiq continued to deny it. (Al-Kulayni 1/138  / Al-Kashshi p. 305)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one report, Hisham bin Salim met a man from Bani Makhzoom in Madinah. They discussed the topic of Imamate, so the man asked, “Who is the Imam today?” He replied, “Ja’afar bin Mohammad <em>alaihi al-salam</em>.” He said, “By Allah, I will tell him!” Hisham reported that he was filled with fear upon hearing this and was afraid that the Imam would rebuke him or cast him away. (Al-Kashshi p. 200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy involved in the Shiasm of the Imams was so deep, that the Imams would intentionally teach their own Shia followers from Iraq conflicting knowledge. (Al-Kulayni 1/39)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At times, the secrecy was so great that the Imams would not share knowledge with their followers in front of their very own children. This occurred between Ja’afar Al-Sadiq and his son Abdullah when Abu Al-Baseer asked him questions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 210)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy was so severe that even the <strong>children of the Imams</strong> were genuinely not aware of these appointments ever being made.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah, the son of Ali bin Abi Talib, said to his nephew, “Your father did not appoint an Imam.” (Al-Kulayni 1/215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In a clearer narration, Zaid bin Ali, in a conversation with Abu Ja’afar Al-Ahwal about Imamate, claimed that he never heard such a thing from his father Zain Al-Abideen. He refuted Abu Ja’afar Al-Ahwal by saying, “My father used to make the hot food warm out of pity for me, are you suggesting that he didn’t have any pity over me going to hell?!” (Al-Kulayni 1/100)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy that surrounded the Imams prevented the message of Imamate to spread. At one point, in Makkah, only four people accepted the message of Imamate during the time of Al-Baqir. (Al-Kashshi p. 179)  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In a <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/01/07/identifying-infallible-imam/">previous article</a>, we have listed the methods as to how one would determine who the next Imam would be. However, upon investigation, we found that these methods were not always used.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hisham bin Salim, instead of seeking evidence for an appointment, resorted to testing Abdullah bin Ja’afar as the Imam by questioning him in basic arithmetic. Upon failing the test, he rejected Abdullah’s claim to Imamate. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 209) The very fact that Hisham had to resort to this makes it clear that he and his companions never heard of an appointment from Ja’afar for his son Musa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, as we have previously mentioned above, Ibn Fadhal accepted Abdullah as an Imam without hearing of an appointment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one strange case, Al-Husain bin Omar, tells Al-Redha that he will accept him as an Imam simply because Al-Redha made that claim. He affirms that he did not hear of Al-Kathim making an appointment. He states that he will complain to Allah on the Day of Judgment if Al-Redha turned out to be a false Imam the same way his father will complain to Allah about Musa Al-Kathim, since he was initially a follower of Abdullah the brother of Musa. (Al-Kashshi p. 305)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the methods of finding out who the appointed Imam was is through the “weapon”, for the Imam is the one that inherits the weapon of the Prophet – peace be upon him – according to some narrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The sons of Abi Al-Sammal respond to Al-Kathim by saying, “Who knows the weapon anyhow?!” (Al-Kashshi p. 338)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, the point they brought up is a fair one, for it was not possible for one to arrive at a conclusion as to whether an artifact was owned by the Prophet – peace be upon him – simply by looking at it.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the above, we have established that early Imamis did not believe that the Imams were twelve, nor were they aware of their identities. At best, they were only notified during the time of the current Imam. This opposes the commonly held view that the companions of the Imams had full lists of who the Imams were going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, even with the overwhelming <strong>authentic</strong> evidence that we have provided, some stubborn Shias may still insist that the identity of the Twelve Imams were always known.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Generally, they will provide two arguments for this.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">They will usually quote the hadith of Jabir bin Samura, which is found in the Saheehain, which suggests that the caliphs are twelve.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There are other narrations that contain the number of the Imams, while other include the full list of the Imams. These narrations clearly contradict the narrations that are provided in this article.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Our response is as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this Sunni narration did not faze any other early Shia sect that disagreed over the number of the Imams. Not only is Jabir bin Samura not reliable according to Shias, but Shiasm does not rely upon Sunni hadiths to establish its own views. Moreover, as we have proved earlier, the Twelvers themselves did not identify themselves with that name, but were known as Al-Qat’eeya.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note: For a complete refutation of the Hadith of the Twelve Caliphs, please refer to this <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/12/hadith-of-twelve-caliphs">article</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the second point, firstly, for the sake of clarity, we shall refer to narrations that affirm the Imamate of the Twelve by name or number as (Set B), while referring to the narrations that have been quoted in our article above as (Set A). It is not reasonable for any person that respects their own intellect to prefer Set B over Set A for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For starters, it is historically accurate that Shias often differed in the numbers of the Imams. This is an irrefutable fact that is attested to by early historians. If Set B was accurate, then these sects wouldn’t have existed in the first place. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, Twelvers would have been known as Twelvers, and not Al-Qat’eeya.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the most famous narration that suggests that all the Imams were known – the narration of Abu Hashim Al-Ja’afar &#8211; was doubted by Mohammad bin Yahya Al-Attar, the teacher of Al-Kulayni. He commented, “I wish this narration came from the path of someone other than Ahmad bin Abi Abdullah, suggesting that it contradicts what is commonly known about the ambiguity of the Imamate. (Al-Kulayni 1/337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In some cases, a narration from Set A, would be transformed into a Set B narration. For example, a narration in Al-Kafi 3/211 contains a supplication taught by Musa Al-Kathim which refers to the Imams without mentioning their names. However, the same exact narration can be found in Al-Saduq’s Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh p. 158 with an addition of the explicit naming of all twelve Imams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below we have included some of our favorite examples of fabrications in order to open the eyes of the doubting Shias:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication that Omar, Uthman, and A’isha Narrated Hadiths of Twelve Imams</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 167) that Omar said: The Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – said: “…my household are from the children of Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, Al-Hussain, and nine grand Imams from the children of Al-Hussain, they are my <em>itra</em> from my flesh and blood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 169) that Uthman said: I heard the Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – say: “The Imams after me are twelve, nine of them are from the progeny of Al-Hussain…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 289) that A’isha said, that the Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – heard Jibreel list out the names of each of the Imams, one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is needless to say that <strong>none</strong> of these narrations are authentic in Sunni nor Shia standards. However, it just shows the lengths taken by these fabricators. Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi goes on to narrate such narrations from over twenty companions. However, we have hand-picked the above since they are seen by Shias as enemies of Ali. This shows that the fabrications are even more unbelievable since these “enemies” would never narrate such a thing since it would be used against them and their rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Leader of Jaroodiyya Zaidism</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another example that is worth mentioning is what Al-Kulayni has narrated in Al-Kafi 1/342 from the path of Abu Al-Jarood from Al-Baqir from Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, that he saw Fatima with the whole list of the names of the twelve Imams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, this goes against the teachings of Abu Al-Jarood himself. Abu Al-Jarood is Ziyad bin Al-Munthir, to whom the Jaroodiyya Zaidi sect ascribes to. Al-Nawbakhti, when describing the teachings of the sect in his Firaq Al-Shia p. 31-32 affirms that the sect does not believe in the appointment of any of the Imams except for the first three. It also doesn’t specify the number of Imams and believes that there can be more than one Imam at one time. It should be noted that Abu Jarood never believed in Al-Baqir or Al-Sadiq as Imams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Main Scholars of the Waqifi Sect</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Waqifi sect believed in seven Imams, with Musa Al-Kathim being the last of the Imams. However, that didn’t stop Twelvers from attributing narrations to them that affirmed all twelve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some fascinating examples of Waqifi scholars that have fallen victim to such attributions include the creator of the sect, like Ali bin Abi Hamza. (Al-Ghaybah by Al-Tusi p. 63-64) Not only does the fabrications affirm the name and the number “twelve”, but also includes that whoever rejects any of them is an unbeliever. (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Not surprisingly, if one were to return to Ali bin Ahmad Al-Musawi’s “Fi Nusrat Al-Waqifa” (via Al-Tusi’s Al-Ghaybah p. 55, 56, 60), one would find that Ali bin Abi Hamza actually taught that the Musa Al-Kathim is the final Imam and that he never died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other examples of this include Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Hamza (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Hanan bin Sadeer (Al-Khazzaz p. 329), Mohammad bin Al-Hasan bin Shammoun and Sama’a bin Mihran (Al-Kafi 1/343), who are all established figures in the sect.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, we are left with two scenarios in regards to the two sets of narrations, A and B. If Set B is authentic, then we must believe that the Imams hid away the names of the Imams from their closest companions and family members, while sharing this knowledge with their enemies who usurped the caliphate and created new sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There shouldn’t be a shred of doubt left that Set A is the orthodox Shia stance, since it is clearly not as ideologically loaded as the narrations of Set B.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though we have presented powerful authentic evidences from Shia sources themselves, we know that it is up to the readers to choose to open their hearts. Selective retention and a forced skimming through the text, instead of an open-minded study of the text, could cause one to shrug off even the strongest of arguments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidences for the lack of clarity and the chaos of everything Imamate in the first centuries cannot be denied. However, as the centuries passed the chaos subsided, which led to generation after generation of Shias that did not question what they were upon, nor to look into the chaos from which they came.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah guide the truth-seekers among the Shia to His true path.  </span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Calamity of Thursday (Content of the Will)</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this two part article, we will be taking a look at one of the most common allegations brought up by Shias in polemical discussions. The “Calamity of Thursday” (Raziyyat Al-Khamees), referred to by many as the Pen and Paper incident, has been abused as the bread and butter of such discussions for a long time. In this portion of the article, we will be examining the question of the content of the will. In the next section, we will be looking into the actions of the Companions on that day and what their actions entail. Even though the two arguments stem from one hadith, we have chosen to divide our response into two sections since these are two separate lines of argumentation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas narrated:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was `Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; said, &#8220;Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; `Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarreled. Some said &#8220;Go near so that the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while the others said as `Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211;  said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4432)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this topic, we will be taking a deep look at the following aspects and sections of the “Calamity of Thursday”:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assumptions Regarding the Will</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Were the Companions Aware of a Clear Appointment for Ali?</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Abbas’ Comments on the Appointment</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sunni Perspective of the Will’s Content</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assumptions Regarding the Will</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main issue with the Shia perspective of the Calamity of Thursday hadith is the sheer amount of baseless speculation. According to the Shia narrative, two main unfounded assumptions are made. The first is that the Prophet – peace be upon him – wanted to appoint Ali as his successor. The second is that the Companions knew of the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – intentions. However, nowhere in the narration do we find clear cut evidences that this was the case. The assumptions are based on Shia preconceptions and the hesitation of the Companions in writing the will.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Were the Companions Aware of a Clear Appointment for Ali?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically, Hadith Al-Ghadeer is perhaps the greatest evidence that both assumptions are flawed. Firstly, if Hadith Al-Ghadeer was indeed an appointment of Ali, then there is no reason to even write a will. <strong>Surely, a statement of appointment by the Prophet – peace be upon him – in front of over ten thousand of his Companions, has much more weight than a written document.</strong> As we all know, documents can be forged, while the testimony of ten thousand eye-witnesses cannot be rejected under any circumstances. It makes absolutely no sense to put it in writing when such an appointment has already been established. It makes even less sense to assume that the Companions assumed that the will was about the appointment of Ali, since such an appointment was allegedly already made publicly, as per the Shia claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The only way to even argue that the Calamity of Thursday was about the appointment of Ali is by suggesting that the Companions did not understand the event at Al-Ghadeer to be an appointment, which is the Sunni point of view.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Abbas’ Comments on the Appointment</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is furthermore ironic that the very person that has narrated this narration is completely oblivious to the preconceptions and claims of the Shias. As it is historically recorded, Ibn Abbas was one of Ali’s closest allies. Not only did Ali have him lead battalions during wars, but he also had him in charge of Basra and the pilgrimage in the year 37 AH. (See Tareekh Khalifa bin Khayyat for example) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas, in the very narration that is quoted above, is describing the misfortune of the “Calamity of Thursday” since he does not know what the Prophet – peace be upon him – wanted to dictate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas does narrate some of the other orders that the Prophet – peace be upon him – made before his death (Saheeh Muslim #1637). These do not include anything about an appointment of Ali. It is also clear from Ibn Abbas’ reactions that what the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; wanted to be written down was different from the other orders that Ibn Abbas narrated:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with them.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If Ibn Abbas knew of the Prophet’s – peace be upon him &#8211; intentions he would not have been saddened, nor would he have continuously display his allegiance to Abu Bakr and Omar who allegedly robbed Ali of his position.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also narrates as we find in Saheeh Al-Bukhari (#4447):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">`Ali bin Abi Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. `Ali)! How is the health of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  this morning?&#8221; `Ali replied, <strong>&#8220;He has recovered with the Grace of Allah.&#8221;</strong> `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him, &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him – and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new ruler to take care of us.&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him – for it.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The above narration does not only display that Ibn Abbas was oblivious to what the Prophet – peace be upon him – intended in his will, but that Ali and Al-Abbas were also oblivious.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sunni Perspective of the Will’s Content</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnis do not hold the position that the writing of the will was an obligation upon the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . If it were an obligation, the Prophet – peace be upon him – would have written the will whether the Companions liked it or not. He wouldn’t have punished the whole Ummah for the mistakes of a few men. Even in the hadith of Ibn Abbas, only a group of the Companions acted in this manner, while the rest wanted the will to be written down immediately.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, the Prophet – peace be upon him – told the Companions to leave on Thursday, but passed away four days later on Monday (Al-Bukhari #1205). He had ample time to write the will. In that time, he instead told the Muslims to give gifts to foreign delegations and to remove the pagans from the peninsula, as per the hadith of Ibn Abbas that we have previously quoted. In another hadith, as per the narration of Abdullah bin Abi Awfa, he orders the Muslims to hold onto the book of Allah (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2740). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though we are certain that no will was written, we do find in Saheeh Muslim #2387 a narration that gives us an idea of what he – peace be upon him – intended to write:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; in his (last) illness asked me to call Abu Bakr, her father, and her brother too, so that he might write a document, for he feared that someone else might be desirous (of succeeding him) and that some claimant may say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I have better claim to it, whereas Allah and the Faithful do not substantiate the claim of anyone but that of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the likely Shia argument that A’isha fabricated this report, we can only appeal to those of sound minds by pointing out that A’isha denied that the Prophet – peace be upon him – didn’t appoint anyone in the end (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2741). She did not believe that he &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; appointed Ali or Abu Bakr.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like readers to also be aware that the <strong>Calamity of Thursday event is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not authentic</span> in Shia sources</strong>, however, Shias accept it simply because it supports their views. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The average Shias will of course reject our evidences and narrations as Sunni propaganda. However, we would like to remind them that we are bound by our sources in the same way that they are bound by their sources. Sunnis cannot simply accept portions of narrations while ignoring the complete historical context through other narrations. Remember, the Sunni view is based on an understanding of the complete picture through the authentic sources. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For those curious as to why the Sunnis don’t reject their own hadith compilations in their first place and adhere to the Shia narrative, we would like to redirect readers to <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/06/02/shia-hadith-vs-sunni-hadith/">our articles on the subject.</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Imami Shia claim and base their entire religion on the appointment of `Ali bin abi Talib through a divine text as leader of mankind after Rasul-Allah (saw). When asked for evidence they will throw any virtue they find for `Ali in the faces of their opponents but most of these texts do not include any signs of him being appointed. The main two narrations relied upon in this regard by the Imami Shia are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a- Hadith al-Ghadeer: A vague text that can be given a plethora of valid interpretations and thus does not constitute solid evidence especially when taking into consideration the context, such as: Location and circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b- Hadith al-Manzilah: A vague text that rather seems to point to the opposite of what Imami Shia claim and this is reinforced by its context and the circumstances in which it took place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wonder though, since Imami Shia believe in twelve Imams not just one, did they all appoint their successors through vague and unclear texts? Or was it only our Prophet (saw) who had the misfortune of not picking the right time along with the worst choice of words? (Sarcasm)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to know this we refer to the books of the Shia and turn our attention to a book that specializes in this matter, Al-Khazzaz al-Qummi (d.400 AH) wrote a book called &#8220;Kifayat al-Athar&#8221; in order to prove the legitimacy of the leadership of the 12 men, he made sure to include texts of appointment for each man, we will quote from this the relevant sections while omitting chains. We may also quote a few from al-Kafi by al-Kulayni.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bismillah,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1- `Ali ibn abi Talib:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/180</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">يا بني أنت ولي الأمر</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When `Ali was on his death bed, he approached his son Al-Hasan and said “O’ my son, you are the person of authority.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2- Al-Hasan bin `Ali:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الأئمة بعد رسول الله صلى الله عليهوآله وسلم اثنا عشر، تسعة من صلب أخي الحسين</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The leaders after the messenger of Allah (saw) are twelve, nine from the progeny of my brother al-Husayn.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/182</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">واختارني علي عليه السلام بالإمامة، واخترت أنا الحسين عليه السلام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hasan said to Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah: “`Ali chose me for <i>leadership</i>, and I choose Al-Husayn.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3- Al-Husayn bin `Ali:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أخبرك يا أخا العرب، إن الإمام والخليفة بعد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم أمير المؤمنين علي عليه السلام والحسن وأنا وتسعة من ولدي منهم علي ابني</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I shall tell you my Arab brother, the leader and successor after the messenger of Allah (saw) is the cheif of believers `Ali (as) and al-Hasan and myself, then nine of my descendants including this son of mine `Ali.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was also asked,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فقلت: بأبي وأمي يا ابن رسول الله إن كان ما نعوذ بالله أن نراه فيك فإلى من؟ قال: إلى علي ابني هذا، هو الإمام وأبو الأئمة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I said: May my parents be a ransom for you O son of Rasul-Allah (saw), if what we fear for you takes place then who shall succeed you? He replied: &#8220;It goes to my son `Ali, he is the leader and the father of the leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4- `Ali bin Husayn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says about al-Baqir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">يا بني إن الإمامة في ولده إلى أن يقوم قائمنا عليه السلام فيملأها قسطا وعدل وأنه الإمام أبو الأئمة معدن الحلم وموضع العلم يبقره بقرا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;O son, leadership is in his (al-Baqir&#8217;s) progeny until that one rises (as) so he may fill it with justice, he (al-Baqir) is the leader, father of leaders, the essence of gentleness and the place of deep knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5- Muhammad bin `Ali:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said that the leaders are twelve after the Messenger (saw) then listed them until he said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأنا ثم بعدي هذا ووضع يده على كتف جعفر</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;ِAnd myself, then after me (in leadership) is this one, and he placed his hand on Ja`far&#8217;s shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man asks him who shall succeed him in leadership,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فإن كان هذا كائن يا ابن رسول الله فإلى من بعدك؟ قال:إلى جعفر وهو سيد أولادي وأبو الأئمة، صادق في قوله وفعله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If something should happen O son of Rasul-Allah (saw), then who is after you? He replied: &#8220;To Ja`far, he is the master of my children and the father of the leaders, truthful in his words and actions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad bin Muslim sat with al-Baqir when his son Ja`far came in, so al-Baqir said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">يا محمد هذا إمامك بعدي فاقتد به واقتبس من علمه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;O Muhammad, this is your leader after me, so follow his example and take from his knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6- Ja`far bin Muhammad:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Says that the leaders are twelve then counts until he says,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ثم أنا، وبعدي موسى ولدي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Then myself, and after me is my son Musa&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was asked,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قلت: فمن بعدك يا ابن رسول الله؟ قال: إني قد أوصيت إلى ولدي موسى وهو الإمام بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said: Who is after you O son of Rasul-Allah (saw)? He (as) replied: &#8220;I have tasked my son Musa with the execution of my will and he is the leader after me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/309</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قُلْتُ لَهُ إِنْ كَانَ كَوْنٌ وَ لَا أَرَانِي اللَّهُ ذَلِكَ فَبِمَنْ أَئْتَمُّ قَالَ فَأَوْمَأَ إِلَى ابْنِهِ مُوسَى</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was asked: If a tragedy should happen then who should I follow as leader? He (Ja`far) pointed towards his son Musa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/310</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">دَعَا أَبُو عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ( عليه السلام ) أَبَا الْحَسَنِ ( عليه السلام ) يَوْماً وَ نَحْنُ عِنْدَهُ فَقَالَ لَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِهَذَا فَهُوَ وَ اللَّهِ صَاحِبُكُمْ بَعْدِي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One day, Aba `Abdillah (as) called on aba all-Hasan (as) while we sat around him then told us: &#8220;By Allah, stick with this one for he is the one you shall accompany after me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7- Musa bin Ja`far:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/190</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">اشهدوا أن ابني هذا وصيي والقيم بأمري وخليفتي من بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kadhim said: “Bare witness that this son of mine is the executor of my will, the one in charge of my affair and my successor after me.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/312</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَأَشَارَ إِلَى ابْنِهِ أَبِي الْحَسَنِ ( عليه السلام ) فَقَالَ هَذَا صَاحِبُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked He pointed to his son abu al-Hasan (as) and said: &#8220;This is the one you shall accompany after me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/313</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَأَخْبِرْنِي مَنِ الْإِمَامُ بَعْدَكَ فَقَالَ ابْنِي فُلَانٌ يَعْنِي أَبَا الْحَسَنِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was asked: Inform me of the leader after you. He responded: This son of mine meaning aba al-Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8- `Ali bin Musa:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said to his companion,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">يا دعبل الإمام بعدي محمد ابني</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;O Da`bal, the leader after me is my son Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/320</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَقَالَ لِي الْإِمَامُ ابْنِي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He told me: The leader is my son. (He had no son except Muhammad according to al-Mufid)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/321</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَلَا أَرَانَا اللَّهُ يَوْمَكَ فَإِنْ كَانَ كَوْنٌ فَإِلَى مَنْ فَأَشَارَ بِيَدِهِ إِلَى أَبِي جَعْفَرٍ ( عليه السلام ) وَ هُوَ قَائِمٌ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ فَقُلْتُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ هَذَا ابْنُ ثَلَاثِ سِنِينَ فَقَالَ وَ مَا يَضُرُّهُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ قَامَ عِيسَى ( عليه السلام ) بِالْحُجَّةِ وَ هُوَ ابْنُ ثَلَاثِ سِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They said to him: May we not see that day (when you die) but if it comes then to who shall it pass? He (as) pointed to his son abu Ja`far (as) who stood in front of him, I said: May I be your ransom, this is a three year old kid? He (as) answered: &#8220;No harm, `Isa (as) established the argument while at the age of three.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9- Muhammad bin `Ali:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الإمام بعدي ابني علي، أمره أمري وقوله قولي وطاعته طاعتي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: &#8220;The leader after me is my son `Ali, his command is mine, his word is mine and his obedience is my obedience.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/323</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الْأَمْرُ مِنْ بَعْدِي إِلَى ابْنِي عَلِيٍّ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: &#8220;The one in charge of the affair after me is my son `Ali.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10- `Ali bin Muhammad:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الإمام بعدي الحسن ابني، وبعد الحسن ابنه القائم</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The leader after me is my son al-Hasan, and after al-Hasan is his son who shall rise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الخلف من بعدي ابني الحسن</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The successor after me is my son al-Hasan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/326</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَقُلْتُ لَهُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ هَذَا صَاحِبُنَا بَعْدَكَ فَقَالَ لَا صَاحِبُكُمْ بَعْدِيَ الْحَسَنُ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said to him: May I be your ransom, is this the one we must accompany after you? He answered: &#8220;No, your companion after me is al-Hasan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for al-`Askari mentioning his hidden son, we won&#8217;t include it out of respect for the reader&#8217;s intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here we observe, that the Shia narrations above are very clear in that a man appointed another as leader, the texts are too explicit and cannot be given any interpretations other than that a certain individual was indeed awarded leadership and given authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though we as Muslims believe all such texts are late fabrications by some Koufans and Qummies, yet at least the fabricators of these texts knew well enough what words they must use to establish their beliefs clearly. This is why in Shia books you will find other texts of appointment for `Ali that are explicit since the Shia themselves were never satisfied with Ghadeer or Manzilah.</p>
