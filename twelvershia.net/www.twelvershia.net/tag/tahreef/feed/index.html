<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef? (Revision: 1.0.0)</p>



<p>Whenever someone raises a question about a narration promoting the belief in distortion of the Holy Qur’ān found in major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts, their apologists immediately embrace deceptive methods&nbsp;to free themselves from all burden. One of these methods is to say that neither did any of their scholars ever compile a work of narrations that he himself considered entirely authentic nor did any of them ever claim such a thing about any of the texts.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team forwards these very same notions in the following words:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih. Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih. Likewise Sheikh Muhammad Jawwad Ma`tiya states the hadith books of our school like Al Kafi, Istibsar, Al Tahdib, Man La Yuhizar al Faiqh contain both Sahih and weak hadiths. Similarly, the books on Fiqha written by our scholars contain material that have mistakes. It would therefore be correct to assert that according to the Shia of Ali [as] there is no book besides that Holy Quran which is flawless from its beginning till its end. One cannot therefore cite the tradition from the Shia hadith book against the Shia of Ali [as] as when the Shia reject the authenticity of such a hadith. In order to corroborate our stance, it would suffice to say that Shiekh Muhammad Yaqub Kuleini (d 329 H) recorded 16200 hadiths in his book ‘Al Kafi’. The scholars have categorized these hadiths in respect of Rijal under five different categories i.e Sahih, Mawthiq, Qawi, Hasan, Daeef [weak]. It is therefore evident that since scholars applied this division to our principle book Al Kafi, that is deemed as reliable and a source of Islamic instructions, the authority and authenticity of other books is self clarified.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4-5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4-5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Many unwary Muslims are deceived by these two expressions due to their lack of knowledge about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> literature and scholars, but those who have spent years as <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> or studying them know very well that these are nothing but patent lies.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has proposed two notions here:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>No <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> author ever claimed that all the narrations compiled in his book “were correct and Sahih.”</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>None among the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars of narrations and jurisprudence testified that any specific <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> text containing narrations “were all acceptable and Sahih.”</li>
</ul>



<p>The following revealing set of facts will show the readers that both these claims are actually lies forwarded by the Answering-Ansar team to deceive Muslims.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction of the Four Books</h2>



<p>Before moving on with the facts, readers should know that the most authoritative compilations after the Qur’ān, according to <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī <u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em>, are what they call <em>al-Kutub al-Arba`a</em> [“The Four Books”]. These four compilations are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em> <em>fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329)</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> of Ibn Bābawayh al-Şadūq al-Qummī (d. 381)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Aĥkām fī <u>Sh</u>arĥ al-Muqni`a</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Istibşār fī mā I<u>kh</u>talaf min al-A<u>kh</u>bār</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ĥusayn Baĥr al-`Ulūm (d. 1422) writes about these four books in his introduction to <em>Tal<u>kh</u>īs al-<u>Sh</u>āfī</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī:</p>



<p>إن الإجتهاد لدى الشيعة مرتكز على الكتب الأربعة الكافي للكليني ومن لا يحضره الفقيه للصدوق والتهذيب والاستبصار للطوسي وهي من الأصول المسلمة كالصحاح الستة لدى العامة</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, scholarly endeavour, according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, is dependant on the Four Books: <em>al-Kāfī</em> of al-Kulaynī, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> al-Şadūq, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb </em>and <em>al-Istibşār</em> of al-Ţūsī. These are from the accepted principle books that are as the Six <em>Şiĥāĥ</em> are according to the Commoners.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tal<u>kh</u>īs al-<u>Sh</u>āfī {Introduction}</em>, of al-Sayyid Ĥusayn Baĥr al-`Ulūm (d. 1422), page 29 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>Let us now proceed:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kulaynī (d. 329) and <em>al-Kāfī</em></h2>



<p><em>al-Kāfī fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of the major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī is the most authoritative and renowned compilation of the Four Books. The author of this work, al-Kulaynī, believed that all the narrations in his work are authentic and correct, and that is the reason why he actually compiled it.</p>



<p>In the introduction of <em>al-Kāfī</em>, he explicitly said:</p>



<p>وقلت إنك تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب كاف يجمع فيه من جميع فنون علم الدين ما يكتفي به المتعلم ويرجع إليه المسترشد ويأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام والسنن القائمة التي عليها العمل وبها يؤدي فرض الله عز وجل وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وقلت لو كان ذلك رجوت أن يكون ذلك سببا يتدارك الله تعالى بمعونته وتوفيقه إخواننا وأهل ملتنا ويقبل بهم إلى مراشدهم</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving <u>correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)</u> and the upright and acted upon traditions from it—through which the compulsory duties of Allāh, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And you said: ‘If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allāh will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 8 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Following this, he said:</p>



<p>وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 9 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an explicit confirmation from al-Kulaynī that the reason he compiled <em>al-Kāfī</em> was so he can provide <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> with a book of authentic narrations that is sufficient for them—i.e. his book only contained correct reports according to him.</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Mahdī al-Āşifī writes about al-Kulaynī while discussing <em>al-Kāfī</em> in his epistle <em>Tarī<u>kh</u> Fiqh Ahl al-Bayt</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جمع رحمه الله في موسوعته هذه ما صح لديه من أحاديث الأئمة الهداة عليهم السلام</p>



<p><strong>“He—may Allāh have mercy on him—has collected what he found authentic from the narrations of the guiding <em>Imāms</em> (as) in this encyclopedia of his.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Riyāđ al-Masā’il fī Bayān Aĥkām al-Shar` wa al-Dalā’il</em>, of al-Sayyid `Alī al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1231), volume 1, page 31 [Qum] – <em>Tarīkh Fiqh Ahl al-Bayt</em> included in the introduction.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū Ţālib al-Tajlīl al-Tabrīzī, author of the famous booklet translated as <em>‘</em><em>Spurious Arguments about the Shia</em>,<em>’</em> confirms this declaration of al-Kulaynī in the introduction to his book known as <em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāwī</em>.</p>



<p>He writes about al-Kulaynī and his <em>al-Kāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد صرح في مقدمته بصحة أحاديثه حيث قال وقلت تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب يأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام . . . . إلى أن قال وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction, when he said: ‘</strong><strong>Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)…’ to: ‘Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>This declaration of al-Kulaynī was so influential in history that it even led a group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars to use it as an argument for <em>their</em> belief in the immaculacy of the contents of <em>al-Kāfī</em>. Among them is al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of that group and an expert in the field of narrations, who staunchly believed in the correctness of all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>He states about the declaration of al-Kulaynī cited above:</p>



<p>وهو صريح أيضا في الشهادة بصحة أحاديث كتابه لوجوه منها قوله بالآثار الصحيحة ومعلوم أنه لم يذكر فيه قاعدة يميز بها الصحيح عن غيره لو كان فيه غير صحيح ولا كان اصطلاح المتأخرين موجودا في زمانه قطعا كما يأتي فعلم أن كل ما فيه صحيح باصطلاح القدماء بمعنى الثابت عن المعصوم بالقرائن القطعية أو التواتر</p>



<p><strong>“This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points.</strong></p>



<p><strong>One of these points is: His statement: ‘Authentic narrations.’ It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-<em>şaĥīĥ</em> narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will </strong><strong>be further explained.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><u>Kh</u></em><em>ātimat Tafşīl Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a ilá Taĥşīl Masā’il al-<u>Sh</u>arī`a</em>, of al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), volume 30, page 196 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> What al-Ĥurr means by “the terminology of later scholars” are the terminologies introduced with the categorization of narrations, in terms of their authenticity, that was not invented until the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> Islamic century. Before this categorization, the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars viewed the narrations to be either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. This will be further elaborated in this writing.</p>



<p>Opposing the view of this group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Mujāhid al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242) replied to this argument in the following words:</p>



<p>إن إخبار الكليني بصحة ما دونه في الكافي كما يمكن أن يكون باعتبار علمه بها وقطعه بصدورها عن الأئمة عليهم السلام فيجوز الاعتماد عليها والحال هذه كسائر أخبار العدول كذلك يمكن أن يكون باعتبار اجتهاده وظهورها عنده ولو بالدليل الظني فلا يجوز إذن الاعتماد عليه فإن ظن المجتهد لا يكون حجة على مثله كما هو الظاهر من الأصحاب بل ومن العقلاء وحيث لا ترجيح للاحتمال الأول وجب التوقف به لأن الشك في الشرط يوجب الشك في المشروط فيلزم التوقف</p>



<p><strong>“Indeed</strong><strong>, the testimony of al-Kulaynī concerning the authenticity of (the narrations) he has recorded in <em>al-Kāfī</em>, just as it is possible that it is in consideration of his knowledge and certainty of their issuance from the <em>Imāms</em> (as), in which case it is permissible to depend upon them and its status will be the same as of all the reports of just individuals, it is (also) possible that it is in consideration of his independent judgment [<em>ijtihād</em>] and their appearance to him on the basis of conjectural proof. In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [<em>mujtahid</em>] is not proof for those of the same stature, as it is obvious from other scholars, in fact, even from those with intellect.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And when there is no preference for the first possibility, it is incumbent to desist from holding on it because doubt about the condition necessitates doubt about what the condition is applied upon. Therefore, desistance is incumbent.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mafātīĥ al-Uşūl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242), page 332 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī leaves out al-Ţabāţabā’ī’s analogical justifications and puts it in simple words:</p>



<p>واعتقاد الكليني بصحة الرواية ليس من الحجج الشرعية إذ ليس هو معصوما عندنا</p>



<p><strong>“The belief of al-Kulaynī about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Dirāsāt fī al-Makāsib al-Muĥarrama</em>, of Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī, volume 3, page 123 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in a nutshell, between the occurrence of inter-<em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> disputes on whether <em>al-Kāfī</em> is entirely correct or not, the fact remains that al-Kulaynī himself declared, and thus believed in, the authenticity of the narrations found in his book.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ibn Bābawayh (d.381) and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em></h2>



<p>Abū Ja`far ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar known as al-Shaykh al-Şadūq, also believed that all the narrations he has recorded in his compilation <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> are all authentic and correct. In fact, just as al-Kulaynī, he has himself declared their authenticity while mentioning the reason why he compiled the work.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh explicitly mentions in the introduction to <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> that he has compiled this work on narrations because another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of his era, Sharaf al-Dīn Ni`ma, requested him to author a condensed work dealing with jurisprudence, Islamic laws and the permitted and prohibited.</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<p>وصنفت له هذا الكتاب بحذف الأسانيد لئلا تكثر طرقه وإن كثرت فوائده ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>I have compiled this book for him without chains of transmission, so that its transmissions should not be too many while its benefits are abundant. I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, exalted is His power.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, of Ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī (d. 381), volume 1, page 2-3 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/man_faqih_1_3.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, of Ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī (d. 381), volume 1, page 3 [Lucknow]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>These words of Ibn Bābawayh are extremely obvious and show that he believed that all the narrations in his book are authentic and correct.</p>



<p>Contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and intellectual, Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, writes after quoting these words of Ibn Bābawayh:</p>



<p>ونصه هذا واضح وصريح في أنه يعتقد بصحة ما في كتابه ويراه حجة بينه وبين الله تعالى</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>This explicit statement of his is clear and unequivocal in showing that he believes in the authenticity of what is in his book, and views it to be proof between himself and Allāh the Exalted.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, page 217 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is further confirmed by al-Tabrīzī, who states about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>وقد صرح لصحة أحاديثه بقوله في مقدمته قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>with his statement: ‘I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is a proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord.’”</strong></p>

<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another thing worthy of mention here is what is mentioned in the transcribed lectures of the contemporary Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Alī al-Sīstānī about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>إنه قدس سره قد شهد في مقدمة كتابه بصحة جميع ما رواه فيه حيث قال ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه إنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Verily, he—may Allāh sanctify his secret—has certified the authenticity of <em>all</em> that he has narrated in it, in the introduction, when he said: ‘I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, sacred is His mention and exalted is His power.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Qā`ida lā Đarar wa lā Đirār</em>, of `Alī al-Sīstānī, page 87 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is obvious from Ibn Bābawayh’s own words, the reason why he removed the chains of transmission from <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> is because he did not want to present any narration that was not authentic or proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] according to him, like other scholars usually did in their compilations. And since Ibn Bābawayh was one of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars and there were no terminologies of the later scholars during his time, it can easily be understood from his authentication that he viewed the narrations to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>However, in case the Answering-Ansar team customarily rejects all manners taught by the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> (ra) to impolitely accuse other “cults” of misinterpreting Ibn Bābawayh’s words, let us cite a few more statements of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who have acknowledged his view.</p>



<p>The major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), who was admired as the “teacher of all” by even the top scholar-marionettes of the Safavids, states in his <em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى رئيس المحدثين ثقة الإسلام محمد بن بابويه قدس الله روحه على متعارف المتقدمة في إطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن إليه ويعتمد عليه فحكم بصحة جميع ما أورده من الأحاديث في كتاب من لا يحضره الفقيه</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The head of the scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>īn</em>], the trustworthy of Islam, Muĥammad ibn Bābawayh—may Allāh sanctify his soul—has taken the <u>traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em></u>.<em>’</em> Thus, he has ruled the correctness of all the narrations he has mentioned in the book <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn wa Iksīr al-Sa`ādatayn</em>, of Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), page 269-270 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of high stature and author of over a hundred texts, Muĥammad Muĥsin al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī (d. 1091), also writes something fairly close in his voluminous <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى صاحبا كتابي الكافي والفقيه على متعارف المتقدمين في اطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن اليه ويعتمد عليه فحكما بصحة جميع ما أورداه في كتابيهما من الأحاديث وإن لم يكن كثير منه صحيحا على مصطلح المتأخرين</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The authors of the two books, <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, have taken the traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em>.<em>’</em> Thus, they have ruled the correctness of all the narrations they have mentioned in their books, even though many of them are not <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to the terminology of the later scholars.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>These quotes sufficiently demonstrate that like al-Kulaynī, Ibn Bābawayh too declared the authenticity of the narrations found in his book in the introduction, while being on the course of the early <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ţūsī (d. 460) and his <em>Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em></h2>



<p>This just leaves the last two of the Four Books. Our respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> brothers may find this hard to assimilate, but al-Ţūsī also confirmed the authenticity of these compilations of his.</p>



<p>al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī states in <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>أن مدار الأحكام الشرعية اليوم على هذه الأصول الأربعة وهي المشهود عليها بالصحة من مصنفها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>These four key books are the pivot of legal rulings today, and they are testified as correct by their compilers.”</strong></p>

<p>Similarly, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar Yūsuf al-Baĥrānī (d. 1186) also states while objecting about the opposing group of scholars from his own <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> school:</p>



<p>أن التوثيق والجرح الذي بنوا عليه تنويع الأخبار إنما أخذوه من كلام القدماء وكذلك الأخبار التي رويت في أحوال الرواة من المدح والذم إنما أخذوها عنهم فإذا اعتمدوا عليهم في مثل ذلك فكيف لا يعتمدون عليهم في تصحيح ما صححوه من الأخبار واعتمدوه وضمنوا صحته كما صرح به جملة منهم كما لا يخفى على من لاحظ ديباجتي الكافي والفقيه وكلام الشيخ في العدة وكتابي الأخبار</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The narrator commendation and condemnation, on which the categorization of reports was based, is obtained from the statements of the early scholars. Similarly, the reports that are related concerning the conditions of narrators in terms of praise and dispraise are (also) obtained from them.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If they have relied upon them [i.e. the early scholars] concerning a matter such as that, how is it that they do not rely upon them concerning the authenticity of the reports that they deemed correct, relied upon and ensured to be authentic as a score of them have (even) explicitly declared—something not hidden to he who has observed the introductions of <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, <u>and the words of <em>al-Shaykh</em> [al-Ţūsī] in <em>al-`Udda</em> and the two books of reports [i.e. <em>Tahdhīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>]</u>.”</strong></p>

<p>These strong words of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that were only uncovered due to the fiery disputes that occurred between them concerning the categorization of narrations in terms of their authenticity, make the stance of the author of the four most authoritative books of narrations very clear—i.e. they viewed the narrations in their works to be authentic and correct.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted here that no one is arguing that what was considered a <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or correct narration among these four scholars is equivalent to what is defined as “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>” according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars today, for it is a known fact that the categorization of narrations followed by the majority of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arīs</em> today was not introduced until long after these four individuals and thus, as quoted from al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and Bahā’ al-Dīn, they were on the traditional course of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars concerning the categorization of narrations—i.e. it is either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>That being said, it has been evidently shown that these four scholars believed the narrations in their books to be correct or as they believed, “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>.” And what is being demonstrated here is their own view of the narrations in their books, not how <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars, who took the other course, understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> and <em>Uşūlī</em> Dispute</h2>



<p>Interestingly, this very same dispute about the categorization of narrations in itself shows that the Answering-Ansar team has not been truthful in relaying information about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar says:</p>

<p>The abovementioned quotes are sufficient in showing that this statement is an obvious lie. Nonetheless, let us quote a few more <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars as an elaboration of this issue so this lie of Answering-Ansar becomes much more clear to the readers.</p>



<p>Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī writes under the heading <em>‘</em><em>The Authentication of the Narrations in the Four Books</em><em>’</em> in his <em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>:</p>



<p>يراد بالتصحيح هنا اعتداد جميع ما في الكتب الأربعة من أحاديث رويت عن أهل البيت عليهم السلام معتبرة ومقطوعا بصدورها عن الأئمة والمسألة هذه وقعت موقع الخلاف بين علمائنا وطال البحث فيها وطال معه النقاش حولها</p>



<p><strong>“What is meant by ‘authentication’ here is considering all the narrations that are related from the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> in the Four Books, to be reliable and certainly issued from the <em>Imāms</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>There has occurred a dispute between our scholars concerning this issue. Discussions lengthened concerning it, and so did the argumentations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, page 210 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This dispute about authentication and categorization of narrations has occurred between two groups of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars. These two groups are known as:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <em>Uşūlīs</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The late introduction of categorizing narrations with four different terminologies in terms of their authenticity and inauthenticity, led the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars to continue following the course early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars adhered to before its invention.</p>



<p><em><u>Sh</u></em><em>ī`ī</em> scholar and researcher, al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Mūsawī al-Ghurayfī (d. 1412) explains this in his work approved by Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī, <em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadīth</em>:</p>



<p>وقد شجب الأخباريون تنويع الحديث وعدوه من البدع التي يحرم العمل بها وبسطوا البحث في إبطاله وإثبات صحة جميع أخبار كتبنا الأربعة بل جميع الأخبار التي نقلوها عن الكتب المعتبرة لأنها محفوفة بقرائن تفيد الوثوق بصدورها عن المعصوم عليه السلام</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have disapproved of the categorization of narrations, and counted it among innovations that are forbidden to be practiced! They elaborated the discussion in nullification of it and establishing the authenticity of all the reports in our Four Books, rather all the reports that were copied from authoritative books, for they are enclosed with evidences that assist the certainty of their issuance from the infallible (as).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Ghurayfī, page 16-17 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up, the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> reject the categorization, considering it unorthodox, and believe that all the narrations in the Four Books are correct and authentic. And as they remain on the course of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who believed a narration can either be <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, their view of the authenticity of narrations is that they are all <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Murtađá Muţahharī (d. 1407) states about the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of scholars:</p>



<p>أنهم يزعمون أن جميع الأخبار الواردة في الكتب الأربعة وهي الكافي ومن لا يحضره الفقيه والتهذيب والاستبصار أخبار صحيحة ومعتبرة بل وقطعية الصدور</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>They claim that all the reports in the Four Books—which are <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>—are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and reliable, in fact, certainly issued (from the infallibles).”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Similarly, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) also writes in his magnum opus, <em>A`yān al-Shī`a</em>:</p>



<p>فزعم الأخباريون أن اخبار الكتب الأربعة كلها صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> claimed that all of the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>While the contemporary expert <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Bāqir al-Īrawānī even mentions this is as the actual reason behind their rejection of the categorization:</p>



<p>وسبب إنكار الأخباريين لهذا التقسيم أن جميع اخبار الكتب الأربعة صحيحة ويجب العمل بها بنظرهم</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The reason behind the rejection of this categorization of narrations by the<em> A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> is: According to their view, <u>all the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and it is necessary to practice upon them</u>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>This group of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that considers all the narrations in the Four Books to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, includes renowned figures who marked their names as major scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>ūn</em>] and jurisprudence [<em>fuqahā’</em>] among them. In fact, their works are viewed to be a part of the most authoritative texts by <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars even today. To name a few:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Khalīl ibn al-Ghāzī al-Qazwīnī (d. 1089): A scholar of narrations and jurisprudence, and author of several texts such as a commentary on al-Ţusī’s <em>al-`Udda</em> and the most famous and great commentary of <em>al-Kāfī</em> ever written in the Persian language, <em>al-Şāfī</em>. <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> biographers mention that he was staunchly against the categorization of narrations, and believed all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> are authenticated by the last <em>Imām</em> himself and it is obligatory to practice upon them.</li>

<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Abbās al-Qummī (d. 1359), who was a renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and biographer, has written under the biography of al-Ĥurr:</p>

He has extensively argued in favour of this position of his in the same compilation mentioned by `Abbās al-Qummī as “the ocean that can not be contested,” <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>.</p>



<p>al-Īrawānī says:</p>

<p><strong>“</strong><strong>In his <em>Wasā’il</em>, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī has gathered the evidences indicating that—meaning, the authenticity of whatever is in the Four Books—and they are (a total of) twenty two evidences.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he did not just stop at simply viewing other works of narrations to be entirely correct, but he also believed that his own compiled work, <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, contained only authentic and correct narrations.</p>



<p>al-Ghurayfī writes while mentioning how the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have argued against the categorization:</p>

<p>Among contemporaries, are the late Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr (d. 1419), after whom the Sadr City suburb of Baghdad is named, and the renowned scholar and propagandist, author of <em>al-Murāja`āt</em>, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid `Abd al-Ĥusayn al-Mūsawī (d. 1377).</p>



<p>`Abd al-Ĥusayn al-Mūsawī writes while representing the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> sect in his alleged dialogue with one of the Grand <em>Imāms</em> of al-Azhar, Salīm al-Bishrī (d. 1335):</p>



<p>نبغ من أصحاب الصادق جم غفير وعدد كثير كانوا أئمة هدى ومصابيح دجى وبحار علم ونجوم هداية والذين دونت أسماؤهم وأحوالهم في كتب التراجم منهم أربعة آلاف رجل من العراق والحجاز وفارس وسوريا وهم أولو مصنفات مشهورة لدى علماء الإمامية ومن جملتها الأصول الأربعة مئة وهي كما ذكرناه سابقا أربع مئة مصنف لأربع مئة مصنف كتبت من فتاوى الصادق عليه السلام على عهده فكان عليها مدار العلم والعمل من بعده حتى لخصها جماعة من أعلام الأمة وسفراء الأئمة في كتب خاصة تسهيلا للطالب وتقريبا على المتناول وأحسن ما جمع منها الكتب الأربعة التي هي مرجع الإمامية في أصولهم وفروعهم من الصدر الأول إلى هذا الزمان وهي الكافي والتهذيب والاستبصار ومن لا يحضره الفقيه وهي متواترة ومضامينها مقطوع بصحتها والكافي أقدمها وأعظمها وأحسنها وأتقنها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>A great portion and large number from the companions of al-Şādiq (as) achieved ultimate wisdom. They became leaders [<em>imāms</em>] of right path, lanterns in darkness, oceans of knowledge, and stars of guidance. Among those, who have their names and conditions recorded in biographical texts, are four thousand men from Iraq, the Ĥijāz, Persia, and Syria. They are authors of famous works, which include the four hundred <em>Uşūls</em> of the <em>Imāmīs</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These (<em>Uşūls</em>)—as we mentioned earlier—are four hundred compilations authored by four hundred authors, which were written during the time of al-Şādiq (as) and contained his verdicts. They were the axis of knowledge and practice after him, to such an extent that a group of eminent scholars of this nation and ambassadors of the <em>Imāms</em> rendered them into books as a facilitation and summarization for the seeker and deriver of knowledge.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The best of what was compiled from the (<em>Uşūls</em>) are the Four Books, which are sources for the <em>Imāmīs</em> in referring to their roots and branches of religion, from their earliest period to this era.&nbsp; These are: <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>al-Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em>, <em>al-Istibşār</em> and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>.

<p>On the other hand, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr even went to the extent of explicitly stating in his book entitled <em>al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p>أن الشيعة وإن كانت مجمعة على اعتبار الكتب الأربعة وقائلة بصحة كل ما فيها من روايات غير أنها لا تطلق عليها اسم الصحاح كما فعل ذلك إخوانهم أهل السنة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, even though they are unanimous upon the reliability of the Four Books and believe in the authenticity of all the narrations in them, do not name them<em> ‘</em><em>Şiĥāĥ</em><em>’</em> as their <em>Ahl al-Sunna</em> brothers did.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>And last but not least, a scholar before these two individuals who also held that all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> are correct, was one of the renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> jurisprudents of his time, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Mīrzā Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī (d. 1355). His belief in the correctness of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> reached such a degree that he declared checking their chains of transmission to be a waste of time.</p>



<p>His student, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī (d. 1412) writes:</p>



<p>وقد ذكر غير واحد من الاعلام أن روايات الكافي كلها صحيحة ولا مجال لرمي شئ منها بضعف سندها وسمعت شيخنا الأستاذ الشيخ محمد حسين النائيني قدس سره في مجلس بحثه يقول إن المناقشة في إسناد روايات الكافي حرفة العاجز</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>More than one of the eminent scholars have mentioned that all the narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> are <em>şaĥīĥ</em></u></strong><strong>, and there is no room for putting away anything from it due to its weak chain of transmission. I heard our master and teacher <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī—may Allāh sanctify his secret—say in one of his gatherings of discussion: ‘Verily, arguing about the chains of transmission of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> is the vocation of an incompetent!’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It becomes crystal clear from all the quotes cited above that a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars consider all the narrations in the Four Books authentic and <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. Specially the narrations found in the most authoritative of the four, <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to deceptively say:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Qummī (d. 307) and his <em>Tafsīr</em></h2>



<p>A celebrated <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of this era, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid `Alī al-Shahrastānī, reveals in his book studying the recording of narrations:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>`Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummiy, the compiler of the famous book of Tafsir that carries his name, <u>has confirmed the authenticity of the Hadiths that he recorded in his book</u> by bearing out that these Hadiths have been reported by trustworthy narrators from the Holy Imams.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The Prohibition of Recording the Hadith: Causes and Effects (English)</em>, of Sayyid Ali al-Shahristaniy, page 510 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is evident, `Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī, who was a major scholar and teacher of al-Kulaynī, also confirmed that the narrations in his Commentary of the Holy Qur’ān are authentic. This, consequently, means that he himself also believed that the narrations in his work are authentic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ĥillī (d. 726), al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī (d. 1011) and Compilation of Authentic Narrations</h2>



<p>Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī, a major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar who is recognized as a reformer of his era among them, even compiled works of narrations in which he collected only authentic narrations. One in which he collected only rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] and fairly authentic [<em>ĥasan</em>] narrations, and another in which he collected only <em>şaĥīĥ</em> narrations.</p>



<p>According to his own work <em><u>Kh</u>ulāsat al-Aqwāl</em>, he named these two compilations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Durr wa al-Marjān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Pearls and Corals: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em> [“The Articulate Method: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ul>



<p>These compilations of narrations are unanimously counted as al-Ĥillī’s books and as it is obvious from the titles, al-Ĥillī believed all the narrations in it are sound and acceptable.</p>



<p>The compilations of al-Ĥillī influenced another famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar, al-Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-`Āmilī, and lead him to also author a compilation of narrations from the Four Books that were authentic and acceptable. He titled this work <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Selected Pearls: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389) writes about this when discussing the first work of al-Ĥillī in his biographical lexicon of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts, <em>al-<u>Dh</u>arī`a</em>:</p>



<p>وقد اقتفى اثره سميه الشيخ حسن بن زين الدين الشهيد صاحب المعالم المتوفى ١٠١١ وصنف كتابه منتقى الجمان في الأحاديث الصحاح والحسان وسيأتي في النون كتاب آخر للعلامة الحلي في هذا الموضوع اسمه النهج الوضاح في الأحاديث الصحاح</p>



<p><strong>“The namesake <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-<u>Sh</u>ahīd (d. 1011), the author of al-Ma`ālim, </strong><strong>has followed his [i.e. al-Ĥillī’s] track and authored his book <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī</em> <em>al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Soon, another book of al-`Allāma al-Ĥillī on this subject will be mentioned under the letter <em>‘</em><em>nūn</em>.<em>’</em> Its title is: <em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>This work is retained by contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, unlike the two works of al-Ĥillī, and used by them as an authoritative work of reference.</p>



<p>Furthermore, not only did Ĥasan claim that the narrations in his compilation are authentic and acceptable; he also believed that the entire contents of the Four Books are authentic.</p>



<p>al-Shahrastānī states:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Shaykh Hasan, in his books entitled Muntaqa al-Juman and al-Ma`alim, has stated that the Hadiths mentioned in the four most reliable Shi`ite reference books of Hadith (<em>al-Kutub al-Arba`ah</em>) and their likes are substantiated by proofs as they were, without any distortion, quoted from the al-Usul as well as the fundamental books the authenticity of which have been unanimously confirmed by the scholars.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kaf`amī (d. 905) and <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em></h2>



<p>Texts on narrations and commentaries aside, even compilations of supplications have been confirmed to be entirely authentic by some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars. Taqī al-Dīn al-Kaf`amī, a well-known and respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar, has compiled a book of narrated supplications that is famously known as <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ja`far Murtađá al-`Āmilī writes about it while citing it as a proof for his arguments:</p>



<p>ما ذكره الشيخ الكفعمي المتوفي سنة ٩٠٥ ه&#x200d; ق في كتابه المصباح الذي جمعه من حوالي مئتين وأربعين كتابا وقال إنه جمعه من كتب معتمد على صحتها مأمور بالتمسك بوثقى عروتها ولا يغيرها كر العصرين ولا مر الملوين كتب كمثل الشمس يكتب ضوؤها ومحلها فوق الرفيع الأرفع</p>



<p><strong>“10: W</strong><strong>hat is mentioned by <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> al-Kaf`ami (d. 905) in his book titled <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em> which he compiled from about two hundred and forty books. He said that he compiled it ‘from books the authenticity of which is reliable and upholding them mandated, and this cannot be altered by the evil efforts of time or by the endeavour of those with twisted minds. Books, like the sun, whose light—is written above the most high of the height.’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has said:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>No Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, truth is at odds with Answering-Ansar today.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and other scholars’ claim that all the narrations compiled in their works are correct and <em>şaĥīĥ</em> is already showed above. But to cap it all off, let us share one last work of a recognized <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who “claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.”</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī has compiled an entire work entitled <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. al-Bahbūdī has claimed to have collected <strong>only</strong> rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> in this compilation, and accordingly, he has named it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.”</p>



<p>To begin with, it should be known that al-Bahbūdī is not a typical graduate of some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> institution, rather he is a reputed and praised scholar of today.</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Shihāb al-Dīn al-Mar`ashī (d. 1411) attributes the following words to al-Bahbūdī in his introduction to a work revised and edited by the latter, <em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm</em> of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877):</p>



<p>وقام العالم الفاضل الموفق لإحياء الزبر الدينية الاقا محمد باقر البهبودي شكر الله مساعيه ووفر معاليه بتصحيحه وتنقيحه بالمراجعة إلى النسخ العديدة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The brilliant scholar, who was victorious in reviving the religious scriptures, Master Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī—may Allāh appreciate his efforts and increase his loftiness—came forth with its correction and critical revision by referring to several manuscripts.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm ilá Mustaĥiqqī al-Taqdīm</em>, of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877), volume 1, page 4 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This al-Bahbūdī is the one mentioned by the <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428) in the following words:</p>



<p>وقد ألف أحد الباحثين في عصرنا صحيح الكافي اعتبر من مجموع ١٦١٢١ حديثا من أحاديث الكافي ٣٣٢٨ حديثا صحيحا وترك ١١٦٩٣ حديثا منها لم يراها حسب اجتهاده صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>One of the researchers of our time has compiled <em>‘</em><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>.<em>’</em> He counted 3328 narrations from the 16121 narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> as <em>şāĥīĥ</em>, and left 11693 narrations that he did not view to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to his judgement.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma`ālim al-Madrasatayn</em>, of al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428), volume 3, page 282 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The existence of this compilation not only exposes Answering-Ansar’s lie, but also shows the dubiousness of the argument reiterated by the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> propagandists of today:</p>



<p><strong>“According to us, only the Qur’ān is <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. We do not call any book <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> other than the Qur’ān as the <em>Sunnīs</em> do with <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>.”</strong></p>



<p>Any unbiased individual can see that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em> is not very different from <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em>. The authors both compiled their respected works with the intention of solely collecting narrations that were rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] according to them. The only difference is that what <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars are trying to do today, was done centuries ago by <em>Sunnīs</em>.</p>



<p>Neither do <em>Sunnīs</em> believe that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em> is <em>şaĥīĥ</em> as the Qur’ān is, nor do they intent to raise the rank of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em> as high as the Qur’ān. Rather, what they mean by calling it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>” is exactly what al-Bahbūdī meant when calling his compilation “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.” So if the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> are unable to unanimously agree upon a certain criterion of judging narrations, are the <em>Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jamā`a</em> to be accused of elevating a book to the position of the Holy Qur’ān for simply agreeing upon the authenticity of the narrations in a book called “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>”?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion – Facts that Prove the Lies of Answering-Ansar</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the abovementioned study of both early and contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts reveals the following facts about their scholars:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī believed and confirmed that all the narrations in his compilation are correct.</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī believed and confirmed that all the narrations in his compilation are correct.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī confirmed in his works such as <em>al-`Udda</em>, as mentioned by al-Baĥrānī, that all the narrations in his two compilations are authentic and acceptable.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many prominent and eminent <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars claim that all the narrations in the Four Books, and particularly <em>al-Kāfī</em>, are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī, a scholar of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u></em>] and jurist [<em>faqīh</em>], claimed that all of the narrations compiled in his book are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and thus it is obligatory to practice upon them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>`Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī confirmed the authenticity of all the narrations in his <em>Tafsīr</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī compiled two works in which he claimed to have collected only authentic narrations. One containing only <em>şaĥīĥ</em> narrations and another containing both <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>ĥasan</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī, the author of al-Ma`ālim, followed al-Ĥillī and also compiled a work in which he collected only authentic and acceptable narrations.</li>
</ul>

</ol>



<p>In light of the facts above, we have the following statement of the Answering-Ansar team:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.

<p>Now, it is up to the readers to decide whether what Answering-Ansar has said is a lie or not.</p>



<p>Readers should also know that this lengthy discussion could have been successfully dealt by proving the mere existence of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. After all, al-Bahbūdī is a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who compiled a book declaring that all the narrations in it are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, while Answering-Ansar blatantly lies by saying “no one among the Shia ulema” did such a thing.</p>



<p>However, several <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts have been cited for readers to realize that this not a simple a matter related to a single text, rather a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been believing and declaring the authenticity of all the narrations in particular texts, to the extent that a group of major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars even denied the late categorization of narrations to uphold their belief that all the narrations in the “Four Books” are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>Thus, it was not just shown that Answering-Ansar has simply lied because there are contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars who have testified to the authenticity of the narrations in their books, but that the Answering-Ansar team is deceptively trying to keep people in the dark about how many <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been viewing their texts throughout history, by lying.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Few Points to Note</h2>



<p>Lastly, a few points about the quote of the Answering-Ansar team should also be noted here:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They have mentioned a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar by the name of:<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>محمد جواد معتية</p>



<p>“Muhammad Jawwad <strong>Ma`tiya</strong>.”</p>



<p>Poor plagiarism. The late scholar’s actual name is:</p>



<p>محمد جواد مغنية</p>



<p>Muĥammad Jawād <strong>Mu<u>gh</u>niyya</strong>.</p>



<p>Had the Answering-Ansar team known the scholar they are copying information about, they would not have confused the diacritical points and made this ignorant mistake.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One of the categories of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> narrations is mentioned as “Mawthiq,” whereas the actual word is “<em>muwa<u>thth</u>aq</em>” [authenticated]. <em>Mawthiq</em> refers to a covenant or a contract, not to mention that it is morphologically incorrect to use it for a narration. This clearly shows how much knowledge of the Arabic language and their own narrations is possessed by the pinnacles behind Answering-Ansar.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our advice to the Answering-Ansar team is that they should pick up a few Arabic text books for beginners before they discuss the sensitive issue of distortion of the Holy Qur’ān, a book of eloquent Arabic.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>We begin with Idah-ul-Fara&#8217;id vol.3 pg.202:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">الثالث : وقوع التحريف فى الكتاب لا يمنع من التمسك بالظهور<br />
قوله الثالث : انّ وقوع التّحريف اه‌<br />
اختلفوا فى وقوع التّحريف بمعنى التغيير بالنقيصة بالمعنى الاعم من وقوعه عمدا او سهوا او نسيانا او من جهة عدم الوصول الى ما نزل اعجازا لعدم الحضور وقت نزوله او غير ذلك و عدمه فالمشهور بين الاصوليّين عدمه مطلقا و هو الّذى ذهب اليه جمع من المحدّثين كالصّدوق في اعتقاداته وغيره وذهب الى التّحريف جمع من قدماء المحدّثين كالكليني وشيخه علىّ بن ابراهيم والنعماني وسعد بن عبد اللّه الاشعري والعيّاشي وبنو نوبخت وفضل بن شاذان ومحمّد بن الحسن الشّيباني وعلي بن الحسن بن فضال والشيخ حسن بن سليمان الحلي تلميذ الشّهيد ومحمّد بن علىّ بن شهر آشوب والشيخ احمد بن ابى طالب الطّبرسي في كتاب الاحتجاج وذهب اليه المفيد في المسائل السّروية والمولى محمّد صالح في شرح الكافي والمجلسيان والسيّد عليخان في شرح الصّحيفة والمولي مهدي النّراقي على ما نقل عنهم و ذهب اليه صاحب المستند الحاج ملّا احمد النراقي على ما حكي عنه ايضا وظاهر السّيد الجليل علىّ بن طاوس في فلاح السّائل و سعد السّعود على ما حكي عنه ايضا وهو ظاهر المصنف (يقصد مرتضى الانصاري) في بحث القراءة من الصّلاة وذهب اليه اكثر الاخباريّين وذهب المحقّق البهبهاني في محكي فوائده الى وقوع التّحريف بالنقصان فى غير آيات الأحكام و هو مذهب المحقق القمي في القوانين بل قال فيه بل الظّاهر من بعض الاصحاب دعوى الاجماع على عدم وقوع تحريف و تغيير فى الكتاب يوجب تغييرا فى الحكم و قال شيخنا المحقق (يقصد الاشتياني) قده فى الحاشية وكان شيخنا الأستاد العلّامة (يقصد مرتضى الانصاري) يميل الى هذا القول اى وقوع النقيصة فى غير الأحكام بعض الميل</p>
<p>[Part Three: (The corruption of the Book does not prohibit from holding on to what is apparent from it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His statement (i.e Ansari&#8217;s): &#8220;Thirdly, the occurrence of corruption etc&#8230;&#8221; They&#8217;ve generally differed (i.e Shia) on Tahreef taking place in the form of deletion/subtraction, whether intentionally or due to inattention, forgetfulness and absence during the time of revelation among other possible reasons. What is popular among the Usuli school is that it never happened at all, as is the opinion of a group of traditionalists such as Saduq in his book of I`tiqadat as well as others. As for those who affirmed Tahreef, they are a group from the ancient traditionalists such as Kulayni, his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim, al-Nu`mani, Sa`d bin `Abdullah al-Ash`ari, al-`Ayyashi, the scholars from the clan of Nawbakht, al-Fadl bin Shadhan, Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Shaybani, `Ali bin al-Hasan bin Faddal, al-Shaykh Hasan bin Sulayman al-Hilli the student of al-Shahid, Muhammad bin `Ali bin Shahr Ashub, Shaykh Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi in his book al-Ihtijaj, al-Mufid in his Masa&#8217;il Sarawiyyah, al-Mawla Muhammad Salih in Sharh al-Kafi, the two Majlisis (father &amp; son), Sayyid `Alikhan in Sharh al-Sahifah, Mawla Mahdi al-Naraqi as is reported from them; Also al-Haj Mulla Ahmad Naraqi the author of al-Mustanad as was reported from him, it&#8217;s also what&#8217;s apparent from the venerated Sayyid `Ali bin Tawus in Falah-ul-Sa&#8217;il and in Sa`d-ul-Su`ud as reported, it is also the apparent position of the author (i.e Murtada al-Ansari) from the topic of recitation during prayer in addition to the majority of Akhbari Shia; Al-Muhaqqiq al-Bahbahani in his Fawa&#8217;id was also of the view that corruption in the sense of subtractions did occur but not in terms of any verse containing a ruling, this opinion was shared by al-Muhaqqiq al-Qummi in his book al-Qawanin where he said: &#8220;It appears that some of our companions claimed a consensus that the corruption of the Book did not cause a change in rulings.&#8221; Our teacher al-Muhaqqiq (i.e al-Ashtiyani) said in the footnotes: &#8220;Our teacher al-Ustadh al-`Allamah (i.e Murtada al-Ansari) used to lean somewhat towards the occurrence of deletions in verses not containing rulings.&#8221;]</p>
<p>From the above, the author offers an impressive list of those who believed in Tahreef al-Qur&#8217;an. Even the title of this section implies that it&#8217;s okay to believe the holy Book has been tampered with and corrupted as long as we stick to what&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>In this same book, we flip a couple of pages ahead in vol.3 pg.206 to learn of the view of the commentator himself:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">وامّا الزّيادة فلا ينبغى احتمالها بل لا يجوز لادّعاء جمع من الأصحاب الاجماع على عدمها و ما فى بعض الاخبار عن ابى جعفر(ع)لو لا انّه زيد فى كتاب اللّه و نقص ما خفى حقنا على ذى حجى و لو قد قام قائمنا فنطق صدّقه القرآن فلا بدّ من تأويله و يمكن تأويله بانّ المراد زيادة بعض الحروف فى بعض الموارد ممّا لا يقدح فى المعنى و لا يوجب تغييره وقد ذكرنا فى باب تواتر القراءات و عدمه انّ ذلك ليس بعزيز مع انكار تواتر القراءات بل هو واقع كثيرا و يدلّ على المعنى المزبور ما نقلنا سابقا عن الصّادق عليه السلام انّ القرآن قد طرح منه اي كثيرة و لم يزد فيه الّا حروف قد اخطأت به الكتبة وتوهّمتها الرّجال وفي بعض النّسخ و قوّمتها الرّجال‌</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for additions we cannot entertain this possibility, rather it&#8217;s impermissible to claim it since a group of our comrades mentioned a consensus on its invalidity. As for what was reported from abi Ja`far (as): &#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t added to God&#8217;s Book and subtracted from it, our right would not have been hidden from any sane person.&#8221; and &#8220;When our riser rises to speak (i.e 12th Imam), the Qur&#8217;an will confirm his speech&#8221; These narrations can be interpreted that what&#8217;s intended are only minor additions of certain letters here and there in a way that does not alter the meaning. We had mentioned in the chapter of the mass transmission of recitations that this isn&#8217;t too much to ask, especially if we deny the mass transmission of the recitations, rather it happens often according to what we narrated from al-Sadiq (as) that &#8220;Many verses were dropped from the Qur&#8217;an but only minor letters were added to it due to scribal errors.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Above we see him quoting the Imams to confirm Tahreef yet he shows objection to any major additions to the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">قد ذكرنا انّ اصل وقوع التّحريف فى آيات الاحكام ممنوع وانّ الاخبار الواردة فى ذلك لم تبلغ مبلغ الحجّية وانّ المتيقّن من الاخبار المذكورة الّتى هى عمدة دليل القائلين بالتّحريف هو سقوط اسماء الائمّة عليهم السّلام خصوصا امير المؤمنين عليه السلام و اسماء المنافقين او هو مع سقوط بعض الكلمات او الآيات فى القصص و الامثال فقط لا الاحكام مع انّ الأئمّة عليهم السّلام قد امروا بالعمل بهذا القرآن فى رواية سالم بن سلمة و غيرها بل قد نقلنا عن العلّامة المجلسىّ انّ اذنهم عليهم السّلام بل آمرهم بالعمل بهذا القرآن معلوم متواتر مع انّ اخبار العرض على الكتاب المتضمّنة لأمر الأئمّة بعرض مطلق الاخبار او الاخبار المتعارضة على الكتاب الموجود بايدينا تدلّ على حجّيته بل على عدم اختلال ظواهره بسبب من الاسباب و الّا فلا معنى للعرض على المجمل كما هو واضح بادنى التفات‌</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We previously mentioned that the basis of the belief in Tahreef is not related to verses of laws and that the narrations containing this meaning are not binding proofs. Those familiar with the evidences of the believers in Tahreef know that they revolve around the deletion of the names of our Imams (as) especially the chief of believers (as) as well as the names of hypocrites, some expressions and verses contained in certain stories but not the rulings. Although the Imams (as) have ordered us to work with this current Qur&#8217;an like in the narration of Salim bin Salamah and others. Rather, we quoted al-`Allamah al-Majlisi saying that they (as) permitted us to work with it in mass recurring reports; It is also known from the reports that order us to present any conflicting narrations to this available Book in our hands, such reports show the Qur&#8217;an as binding proof for us and that the apparent meanings contained in its text are not corrupted otherwise there&#8217;s no reason to present anything to it as is clear.]</p>
<p>He finally concludes that even though it&#8217;s corrupt, yet corruption does not affect rulings nor does it alter the meaning of the available texts, thus we can still use this corrupted Qur&#8217;an to worship and present any conflicting narrations to it. Truly, a student of Majlisi!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Intellectual Dishonesty of Al-Khoei<br />
</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mostly taken for granted by students of knowledge the amount of effort that modern scholars and editors invest in their works. One of their tasks, the quoting of earlier works in the way that was intended by the original author, is one of their main responsibilities. That is because the reader trusts the modern scholar enough to not return to the original source. Due to this, when a modern scholar provides the reader with incorrect quoted information, the modern scholar is cheating the reader’s faith and trust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is with the above in mind that we would like to share with readers an example of Al-Khoei’s intellectual dishonesty.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Background: The Status of Zurarah</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zurarah bin A’ayan is one of the top Shia narrators. He is excessively praised by early Shia scholars and we can find several reports in Shia books in which the “infallible” Imams praise him greatly. However, we also find reports from the same Imams in which he is severely condemned. This is especially problematic because both groups of reports are authentically attributed to the Imam (by Shia standards).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of being cautious and rejecting Zurarah’s reports due to the vagueness of his status in the eyes of the Imams, the Shias chose to take a different approach. They theorized that the Imam condemned Zurarah in order to make him look like an enemy, in order to protect him from their foes that would target the students of the Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though this theory is far-fetched, it is a much preferable option to Shias than to reject Zurarah’s narrations, since he truly narrates a very large number. His narrations amount to 2,490 in the four books according to Al-Khoei 8/254.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What also supports this far-fetched theory was the following concocted narration:</span></p>

He quotes:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I (Ja’far Al-Sadiq) only attacked you (Zurarah) in order for them to praise you in your religion, due to your flaws, and this would be used for prevent them from harming you. Allah – glory be to Him – said, ‘As for the boat, it belonged to poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized <strong>every boat by force.</strong>’ (Surat Al-Kahf: 79) This is how it was revealed by Allah: <strong>Fine.</strong>”</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I (Ja’far Al-Sadiq) only attacked you (Zurarah) order for them to praise you in your religion, due to your flaws, and this would be used for prevent them from harming you. Allah – glory be to Him – said, ‘As for the boat, it belonged to poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized <strong>every <u>fine</u> boat by force</strong>.’ (Surat Al-Kahf: 79) This is how it was revealed by Allah: <strong>Fine.</strong>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Refuting a Possible Shia Excuse</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shias might say that Al-Khoei relied on an early edition of the book that did not include the term: “fine”, as part of the verse in Surat Al-Kahf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We agree. This is obviously the case. Al-Khoei relied on a flawed print of the book <u>purposefully.</u></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3619 alignright" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-150x150.jpg" alt="murtadha-askari" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3620 alignright" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-150x150.jpg" alt="murtadha-cover" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Murtadha Al-Askari in his Al-Qur’an Al-Kareem wa Riwayat Al-Madrasatain 3/499 points out that there are two editions of the book, one that was printed in Bombay and another that was printed in Iran. The former does not include the word: “fine,” while the latter does.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei himself states in 10/309 of Mu’jam Rijal Al-Hadith that he relies on both editions of the book and we find him often speaking of discrepancies between the versions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note<em>: It is important to keep in mind that the editors of Al-Kashshi (p. 9) stated that the Bombay edition is one that is filled with mistakes to the extent that readers, at times, would not be able to make sense of what was written. They went on to say that the best version of the work is Al-Qahba’ee’s copy.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3613 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover-150x150.jpg" alt="qahbaee-cover" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-cover-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3612 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-150x150.jpg" alt="qahbaee" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qahbaee-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Al-Khoei, when challenged with discrepancies also relies on other works like Al-Qahba’ee’s Majma’ Al-Rijal in order to arrive at a final verdict.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Al-Qahba’ee’s Majma’ includes the word: “fine,” as part of the verse as well.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why did Al-Khoei Rely on the Mistake?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei found himself torn between accepting a narration that benefited Shiasm greatly, while at the same time it conflicted with his views about the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3617 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-150x150.png" alt="khoei2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-62x62.png 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-184x184.png 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>We find in 8/253 that Al-Khoei authenticates the report above and uses it to explain away all the narrations in which Zurarah is condemned by the Imams. The narration is the foundation of Shia argument that explains away all the negative reports as “taqiyyah.” Therefore, it was extremely important to highlight it and make its authenticity known.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the narration included a recitation of the Qur’an by the Imam that is not accepted by Al-Khoei. Since Al-Khoei does not believe in abrogation or variant readings, as we have established in <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/09/19/response-to-the-collection-and-preservation-of-the-quran/" rel="external nofollow">another article</a>, accepting the word: “fine”, as part of the verse, would mean that the Qur’an that we recite today has been tampered with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei, as most Shias know, does not endorse the view that the Qur’an has been tampered with.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei, desperate to have his cake and eat it, found his salvation in an erroneous version of the text. It did not matter if it was based on a corrupted print of Rijal Al-Kashshi, nor does it matter if the text has a clear error that is obvious from the context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All that mattered was that it fit his ideology and that it explained away the negative narrations about Zurarah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavyweight of the Shia, their leader and the author of one of their eight main Hadith books, al-Hurr al-`Amili is no doubt from the top Shia scholars of Hadith and has earned the utmost respect by the followers of this sect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This man comes as no surprise since he is the most outspoken of all Akhbari Twelver Shia scholars and we all know their stance regarding Allah&#8217;s book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s dive right into his books and expose his deviance to the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his book &#8220;Ithbat-ul-Hudat&#8221;, after mentioning three reports where the Imams claim their names were present in the Qur&#8217;an before it was changed, he commented saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">أقول: هذه الأحاديث و أمثالها دالة على أن النص على الأئمة عليهم السّلام و كذا التصريح بأسمائهم و قد تواترت الأخبار بأن القرآن نقص منه كثير و سقط منه آيات لما تكتب، و بعضهم يحمل تلك الأخبار، على أن ما نقص و سقط كان تأويلا نزل مع التنزيل، و بعضهم على أنه وحي لا قرآن، و على كل حال فهو حجة في النص و تلك الأخبار متواترة من طريق العامة و الخاصة</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">[I say: These narrations and their likes are evidence that the textual appointment of the Imams (as) in addition to their names (were present), and the narrations have reached mass transmission (Tawatur) in declaring that much was lost from the Qur&#8217;an and that verses from it were dropped without being written. Some consider these reports to be referring to explanations that descended alongside the revelation while some consider it as revelation but not a part of the Qur&#8217;an. Either-way, the text is valid proof and those narrations are mass transmitted by the general Muslims and the Shia.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ithbat-ul-Hudat 2/206</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above, he is saying that some verses were lost and removed for sure. Then he gives some of the interpretations of those who don&#8217;t believe in its corruption. Finally, he concludes that no matter what the case, the Qur&#8217;anic text is still valid even if some verses are missing, and that the reports of corruption are mass-transmitted thus undeniable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same book while copying some texts from Rabi`-ul-Abrar by al-Zamakhshari, he writes the story of how the Qur&#8217;anic verses were lost:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و روى أيضا أحاديث كثيرة في الطعن على عثمان، تركناها اختصارا، منها: ما تضمن أنه جمع الناس على قراءة زيد بن ثابت خاصة، و أحرق المصاحف، و أبطل ما لا شك فيه أنه منزل من القرآن‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And he (i.e al-Zamakhshari) narrated many reports criticizing `Uthman but we left it for the sake of brevity. From them: Is that he gathered the people upon the recitation of Zayd bin Thabit and burned the Masahif thus destroying what were undoubtedly revealed Qur&#8217;anic texts]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ithbat-ul-Hudat 3/380</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When he says &#8220;destroying&#8221; he means that those verses are lost to no return because of `Uthman. Indeed, the fact that `Uthman compiled the Qur&#8217;an into book form has turned many Shia away from it due to their hatred of Umayyads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to learn more about his belief, we turn towards a more specialized book. A treatise by the name of &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; written by al-`Amili.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you&#8217;re going to find it odd, that a person who believes in Tahrif would have a book aiming to prove the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an. The title of the book &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; implies that the author wouldn&#8217;t be from those who believe in Tahrif, nonetheless let&#8217;s read what the researcher of the book al-Sayyid Muhammad Hadi Karami says in the introduction pg.21 while discussing the contents of the book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then the Shaykh (i.e al-`Amili) mentioned that the presence of deletion (in the Qur&#8217;an) does not oppose the fact that what&#8217;s present from it (today) is mass transmitted nor does believing in this (i.e deletion) cause harm. What opposes the mass transmission (of the Qur&#8217;an) is the presence of additions and distortions.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There you have it folks! According to the researcher&#8217;s summary, al-`Amili proves that the Qur&#8217;an is mass transmitted even though the Companions removed verses of `Ali&#8217;s merits. The deletion of verses does not constitute any harm when it comes to Tawatur, only additions are problematic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, when al-`Amili is talking about Tawatur, he isn&#8217;t talking about the mass transmission of the Qur&#8217;an as it was revealed to prophet Muhammad (saw). Since as you know he believes verses are missing, he&#8217;s mainly talking about the mass transmission of `Uthman&#8217;s official Qur&#8217;an after those verses were dropped and after the official version was spread in the lands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researcher makes sure to highlight this point on the same page:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It&#8217;s no secret, that the debate revolves around the mass transmission of this Qur&#8217;an from the Prophet (saw) not its mass transmission from those who had later collected it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s move to al-`Amili&#8217;s own words and see if the researcher got it right, he says on pg.31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Mixing both additions and deletion when discussing this matter is not good. Because the deletions, in case they did actually occur, do not oppose the mass transmission of what is present today. We are only discussing the amount that is found in the Book now, is it mass transmitted or not? Does it contain additions, distortions and alterations or not? No doubt it is mass transmitted today.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice the author refuses to discuss deletions, he says they aren&#8217;t harmful and the discussion is only concerning the verses that survived today in the Qur&#8217;an, have they reached us through Tawatur or not? He says if they did, then it is evidence that no additions or distortions took place in our Qur&#8217;an, yet he never mentions deletions as if it isn&#8217;t a big deal if our Qur&#8217;an lost verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili then quotes al-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Damad on pg.40, al-Damad quotes the verse about Allah promising to protect the revelation and comments that it is an evidence against those who believe the Qur&#8217;an contains additions or that parts may be corrupted and replaced with others, also its order and arrangement. However, when he reaches the part about &#8220;deletion&#8221; Damad says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Regarding verses being left behind, or being dropped after they were revealed, the majority of our companions allow this and a few of the commoners as well. The majority of the mainstream (Muslims) prohibit this completely although the narrations in our books and theirs are plentiful in stating that these deletion did in fact take place generally.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ِAl-`Amili then writes that the Muslims had unquestionably transmitted the Qur&#8217;an and that even if the Muslims had certain motivations to remove or hide certain verses, then this is restricted to a small portion of the Qur&#8217;an not all of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili then quotes two narrations about how `Ali collected the full Qur&#8217;an and how the Companions rejected it. Then `Umar began collecting the Qur&#8217;an by bringing at least two witnesses for every verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili comments on the narrations pg.68:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: I learned from these two narrations and their likes, that they (as) ruled that this Qur&#8217;an is truthful, all of it is correct without any additions or distortion. However, what is understood from the two reports regarding the deletion, is possibly concerning the interpretation that descended alongside the revelation and there&#8217;s quite a few clues for this, Or it could be that it&#8217;s concerning the revelation that isn&#8217;t part of the Qur&#8217;an as al-Saduq previously stated. It is also possible that it refers to abrogation among other possibilities. What is apparent from the second report is that the deletion was related to what contained the scandals of those folks including the textual appointment of the Imams. The presence of those texts would have exposed their disobedience and so no doubt nothing more than these kinds of texts were dropped. This however does not negate the mass transmission of what was dropped (from verses) let alone what is still present. The reason that they (i.e Companions) requested two witnesses (for each verse) instead of one, was simply a ruse and a scheme on their part, due to the prevalence of Taqiyyah and the number of hypocrites who support them (i.e supported Abu Bakr and `Umar) as well as the small number of their opponents who were siding with the chief of believers (as). It&#8217;s sufficient for you to know that they were followed by countless thousands whereas the chief of believers (as) only had the support of four people, this makes things clear.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the above he lists various possibilities for what was dropped and that it might be interpretation or revelation. Then he says that the second narration hints that certain verses were indeed dropped and they would have exposed Abu Bakr and `Umar if they remained. This is why Abu Bakr and `Umar, when collecting the Qur&#8217;an, placed a condition that any verse that must be written needs two witnesses. By doing so, they got rid of all verses related to the Imam&#8217;s appointment as he and his supporters couldn&#8217;t speak since they were in Taqiyyah, thus those verses were not written due to the absence of witnesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili states that the Qur&#8217;an was mass transmitted during the time of the Prophet (saw) and that the Companions had all verses written, however he doesn&#8217;t mean that this proves that no verses were lost later, because he states right after that this was the case until `Uthman burned them as if to hint that it was mass transmitted until `Uthman destroyed the evidence by force. On pg.99:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[No doubt that the people had many copies written (of verses) and the original copies remained preserved in written form with those we mentioned out of precaution in order to guard the Qur&#8217;an at least until the reign of `Uthman.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you will learn why al-`Amili was only addressing additions and distortions yet avoiding deletions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another book while disputing with another scholar&#8217;s evidences he said about the Qur&#8217;anic verses pertaining to lawful foods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وقد تواترت الروايات بأنه لم يجمع القرآن كله الا الأئمة عليهم السلام وان من أدعى انه جمعه كله فهو كاذب. وورد النص الصحيح بأن القرآن الذي نزل على محمد صلى الله عليه واله كان سبعة عشر ألف آية. والموجود الان نحو الثلث باعتبار العدد. ويحتمل كون تلك الآيات أطول من الآيات الموجودة ويكون الموجود منه هو العشر او اقل وتواتر النص بأن المهدي عليه السلام اذا خرج يخرج القرآن بتمامه فينفر أكثر الناس منه ولا يقبله الا القليل. فكيف يقال : ان جميع المحرمات قد فصلت لنا في هذا القرآن الموجود ليمكن الحكم باباحة ما ليس فيه وهذا لا يتم الا على طريقة العامة وهذا الاستدلال لا يليق صدوره عن أحد من العقلاء فضلا عن الفضلاء</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The narrations mentioning that the entire Qur&#8217;an was only collected by the Imams (as) have reached mass transmission (Tawatur) and that whoever claims to have collected it has lied. The authentic text has also reached us that the Qur&#8217;an revealed to Muhammad (saw) was seventeen thousand verses whereas the one available today is only a third of this number. It is possible that those (missing) verses are longer than the ones present and so what&#8217;s available could be a tenth or less from the actual size. It&#8217;s also been mass transmitted that the Mahdi (as) when he emerges, shall bring out the complete Qur&#8217;an but the people will be repulsed by it while only a minority accept it. How then could it be said: &#8220;All prohibited foods have been specified for us in this present Qur&#8217;an and so everything not mentioned therein is lawful.&#8221; This can only be correct according to the methodology of the mainstream Muslims (Sunnies) but this can&#8217;t be considered as binding proof to any sane person let alone a virtuous one.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Fawa&#8217;id al-Tusiyyah pg.483-484.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so al-Hurr al-`Amili holds the classic Shia belief that the Qur&#8217;anic text is a legitimate religious proof although it&#8217;s missing verses. Similar to al-Fayd al-Kashani and others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad bin Ya`qub al-Kulayni is disputably the top Twelver Shia Hadith scholar to ever walk the earth. They trust him and honor him to no end, even going as far as bestowing upon him the title of &#8220;Thiqat-ul-Islam&#8221;. Al-Kulayni is the author of their main book of Hadith &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; which is a large 8 volume collection of traditions and beliefs relied upon by the Twelvers throughout their history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, is he a Muslim who believes in the authenticity of our holy book or is he on the other side of the fence?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelvers will jump right up and shout: &#8220;It is the evil Wahhabi scholars who accuse Kulayni of Tahrif!!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is this the truth though? We find out below,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A- The biggest of Shia scholars testify that al-Kulayni clearly believes in Tahrif.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Fayd al-Kashani writes in the sixth introduction of his book &#8220;Tafsir al-Safi&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the belief of our teachers may Allah have mercy on them, then what is apparent from Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni is that he believed in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an and that it suffered from deletions. This is because he narrated texts in this regard inside his book al-Kafi and never criticized them in any way, although he mentioned in the introduction of his book that he trusts whatever he narrates therein. The same can also be said about his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi writes in his large book &#8220;Mir&#8217;at-ul-`Uqul&#8221; 3/31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our Companions differed regarding this (i.e Tahrif), al-Saduq ibn Babuwayh and a group held the opinion that the Qur’an is unchanged from how it was revealed and that nothing is missing. Whereas, al-Kulayni, Shaykh al-Mufid and a group of scholars, may Allah sanctify their souls, they believed that the complete Qur’an is with the Imams (as) and that what we have in our Book today is only a part of it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Nuri al-Tabrasi wrote in the third introduction of his popular book &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Mentioning the opinions of our scholars may Allah be pleased with them all, regarding whether the Qur&#8217;an was changed or unchanged. You must know that they have several opinions in this regard, two of which are famous: The first opinion is that distortions and deletions have occurred in it (i.e the Qur&#8217;an), this is the belief of our venerated scholar Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi, the teacher of al-Kulayni. He announced this explicitly at the beginning of his book of Tafsir and filled it with such narrations, while noting that he declared his commitment to only mentioning in it what he receives from his trusted teachers. This was also the belief of his student, Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni may Allah have mercy on him as attributed to him by a group of scholars. This is because al-Kulayni reported a large amount of explicit narrations in this regard (i.e Tahrif) in Kitab-ul-Hujjah especially in the chapter &#8220;Al-Nukat wal-Nutaf min al-Tanzil&#8221; as well as in Kitab-ul-Rawdah, he never objected to them nor did he give them a convenient interpretation. (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) This too, is the explicit belief of the trusted Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Numani, al-Kulayni&#8217;s student and the author of the popular book &#8220;al-Ghaybah&#8221;, he mentioned it in his small book of Tafsir which he restricted only to mentioning the categories of verses, it serves as an explanation for the introduction of `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi&#8217;s Tafsir.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is confirmed in &#8220;Tafsir al-Qummi&#8221;, if you are to refer to the introduction of the researcher, their Shia scholar Al-Sayyid Tayyib al-Musawi al-Jaza&#8217;iri on pg.23-24:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the Shia, they agreed that there are no additions inserted into the Qur&#8217;an, in fact they claimed a consensus on this. As for deletions, a group of Imami scholars believed it they never took place and they strongly rejected this, such as al-Saduq, Sayyid al-Murtada, abu `Ali al-Tabrasi in &#8220;Majma al-Bayan&#8221; and al-Shaykh al-Tusi in &#8220;al-Tibyan&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s clear from the words of other scholars and early traditionalists as well as late ones, that they believed in deletions such as al-Kulayni, al-Barqi, al-`Ayyashi, al-Nu`mani, Furat bin Ibrahim, Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi author of &#8220;al-Ihtijaj&#8221;, al-Majlisi, al-Sayyid al-Jaza&#8217;iri, al-Hurr al-`Amili, al-`Allamah al-Fatuni and al-Sayyid al-Bahrani. In order to prove their belief, they held on to the verses and narrations that cannot be overlooked. What reduces the shock is that the corruption that took place in their opinions is very small, it is restricted to the verses of love (towards the household) without changing any ruling or altering the general meaning that constitutes the soul of the Qur&#8217;an.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their popular scholar al-Sayyid Habibullah al-Musawi al-Khu&#8217;i said in his book &#8220;Minhaj-ul-Bara`ah&#8221; 2/198:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Majority of Akhbaris as reported by al-Sayyid al-Jaza&#8217;iri in his treatise &#8220;Manba`-ul-Hayah&#8221; and his book &#8220;al-Anwar&#8221; believed that corruption, addition and deletion have occurred. This opinion was held by Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi, his student Muhammad bin Ya`qub al-Kulayni, Shaykh Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi and the grand scholar and traditionalist al-Majlisi may Allah sanctify their souls.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Ayatullah al-Sayyid Yusuf al-Tabrizi said in &#8220;Durar al-Fawa&#8217;id&#8221; 1/303:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the corruption, as in deletion, they have differed on it. What is popular among Usulis is that it never happened and this was adopted by a group of scholars such as al-Saduq in &#8220;al-I`tiqadat&#8221; among others. As for those who believed in distortion, they are a group of the ancient traditionalists such as al-Kulayni, his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi the author of the commentary, al-Nu`mani, Sa`d bin `Abdullah al-Ash`ari as well as most Akhbaris. Some of our researchers have concluded that corruption took place through deletion, however this has not affected the verses which contain rulings as is the belief of al-Muhaqqiq abu al-Qasim bin Hasan al-Qummi in &#8220;al-Qawanin&#8221;.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar al-`Allamah Yusuf al-Bahrani says in &#8220;al-Durar al-Najafiyyah&#8221; 4/66:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group believed that it happened (i.e Tahrif), the respected and trusted `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi has affirmed this with certainty in his commentary. It is also what&#8217;s apparent from his student al-Kulayni in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; where he reported a lot of narrations pointing to omissions and deletions without rejecting them nor offering another interpretation. This is also what&#8217;s apparent from the respected and trusted Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi in &#8220;al-Ihtijaj&#8221; and it is also quite apparent in my own opinion. Our teacher, the traditionalist Shaykh `Abdullah bin Salih al-Bahrani has affirmed it with certainty as well in his book &#8220;Muniyat-ul-Mumarisin&#8221; and this was the chosen opinion by the teacher of the sect al-Mufid in &#8220;Ajwibat al-Masa&#8217;il al-Sarawiyyah&#8221;etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Ayatullah Sayyid `Ali Fani Isfahani said in &#8220;Aara&#8217; Hawl al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; pg.88:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The fifth question: Who are those that believe in Tahrif and what are their evidences?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is that a group of traditionalists and collectors of narrations have observed in our reports what appears to imply corruption through deletion so they believed in this. (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) This appears to be the opinion of al-Kulayni who narrated clear reports about it without making any comments. Al-Sayyid Ni`matullah al-Jaza&#8217;iri  also adopted the position of Tahrif in his two commentaries on the &#8220;Tahdhibayn&#8221; and he conducted a prolonged research concerning it in a treatise he called &#8220;Manba` al-Hayah&#8221;.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to other well known Shia scholars who attributed this belief to al-Kulayni but we need not translate more quotes as the above are sufficient for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask, after all this do the Shia laymen still insist that it is the &#8220;Wahhabies&#8221; who attribute Tahrif to your scholar? Or is it his own comrades who confirm his belief in Tahrif?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B- Al-Kulayni reports many narrations in his book clearly implying Tahrif.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man collected in his large book plenty of reports that clearly imply the distortion and corruption of Allah&#8217;s book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is important to note here is that the author of al-Kafi has divided his book into three parts. The first part is called &#8220;Usul al-Kafi&#8221; and it contains the foundations and most important pillars in the belief system of the Twelvers, the second part is called &#8220;Furu` al-Kafi&#8221;  and it contains the branches and general laws of Twelver jurisprudence, the third part is the least important and is called &#8220;Rawdat-ul-Kafi&#8221; and it contains some stories and odd events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni has designated a specific chapter called &#8220;Bab Fihi Nukatun wa Nutafun min al-Tanzil fil-Walayah&#8221; in which he collects a large number of such reports. Of course since Tahrif is from the foundations of his faith he includes this chapter in volume one of Usul al-Kafi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other similar narrations will be scattered all throughout the eight volumes of al-Kafi, so let us list a few examples for you below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/414:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) Abu Basir, from abi `Abdillah (as), regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger in loving `Ali and loving of the leaders after him has certainly attained a great attainment&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;This is how it was revealed.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment} [33:71]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/416:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from `Abdullah bin Sinan, from abi `Abdillah (as) regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And We had already taken a promise from Adam concerning Muhammad, `Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn and the leaders from their progeny, but he forgot&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;By Allah, this is the way it was revealed upon Muhammad (saw).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.} [20:115]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/417:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from Jabir, from abi Ja`far (as), he said: &#8220;Jibril (as) revealed this verse to Muhammad (saw) like this: How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed about `Ali through [their] outrage.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage} [2:90]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/422:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from abu Basir, from abi `Abdillah (as) regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;A questioner asked about a punishment bound to happen &#8211; To the disbelievers in `Ali&#8217;s love; of it there is no preventer.&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;By Allah, this is how Jibril (as) revealed it to Muhammad (saw).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{A questioner asked about a punishment bound to happen &#8211; To the disbelievers; of it there is no preventer.} [70:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, al-Kulayni has a chapter in his first volume called: &#8220;That nobody collected the entire Qur&#8217;an except the Imams (as)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under it he reports narrations such as, al-Kafi 1/228:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from Jabir, he said: I heard aba Ja`far (as) saying: &#8220;No one can claim that he has gathered the entire Qur&#8217;an as it was revealed except a liar. It was only collected and memorized, as Allah revealed it, by `Ali (as) and the Imams after him (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to plenty of other examples. However, a Shia will quickly jump and say that these reports can be weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If that&#8217;s the objection then let us quote for this Shia authentic narrations from al-Kafi that clearly imply Tahrif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 2/634:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Al-Hakam from Hisham bin Salim from Abi `Abdullah (as), he said, “The Qur’an that Jibril (as) brought down to Muhammad (saw) has seventeen thousand verses.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It goes without saying that our Qur&#8217;an today is a lot less, it&#8217;s around six thousand verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia will try to object to this report by two methods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- They will try to weaken the narrator and we refuted them (<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/02/19/response-to-hadeeth-17000-verses-in-the-quraan-saheeh/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- They will say it&#8217;s originally seven thousand not seventeen. They say it&#8217;s a copyist error. This too is false since if one were to return to the manuscripts of al-Kafi he&#8217;d realize that the vast majority of them state it is 17,000. It&#8217;s not possible all writers got it wrong while a single one got it right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/184:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from Ibn Abi `Umayr from Umar bin Udhaynah from Burayd bin Muawiyah, he said: Abu Ja`far (as) recited, “O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you fear disagreement in this matter, refer it to Allah and the Messenger and those in authority among you,” He then said, “How can he order to obedience but not in disagreement? He said this to those that were ordered, those that were told to: Obey Allah and obey His Messenger.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qur&#8217;an we have today says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O’ you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree on something, refer it to Allah and the Messenger} [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/290</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from `Ali bin Asbat from `Ali bin abi Hamzah from abu Baseer from abu `Abdillah (as): &#8220;And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited with the authority of the devils during the reign of Solomon.&#8221; And he also recited: &#8220;Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. So from them is he who believed, and from them is he who rejected, and from them is he who affirmed, and from them is he who changed, And whoever exchanges the favor of Allah [for disbelief] after it has come to him – then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verses are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon.} [2:102]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. And whoever exchanges the favor of Allah [for disbelief] after it has come to him – then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.} [2:211]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/184:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from `Ali bin Asbat from `Ali bin abi Hamzah from abu Baseer from abu `Abdillah (as): &#8220;And if We had decreed upon them, “Kill yourselves and submit to the Imam in (full, willing) submission or Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. And if the opponents did what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].&#8221; and in this verse: &#8220;and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged in the matter of the leadership, and submit to Allah their obedience in [full, willing] submission.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verses are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And if We had decreed upon them, “Kill yourselves” or “Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].} [4:66]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.} [4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/205:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi `Umayr from Hammad bin `Uthman that he said: I recited to abu `Abdullah (as) {Two just men from among you} He (as) said it is &#8220;A just man among you&#8221; He (as) said: “This is from the mistakes of the writers.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verse is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram. And whoever of you kills it intentionally – the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed, as judged by two just men among you as an offering [to Allah] delivered to the Ka’bah, or an expiation: the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting, that he may taste the consequence of his deed. Allah has pardoned what is past; but whoever returns [to violation], then Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.} [5:95]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/391:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi `Umayr from ibn Uthaynah from Zurarah or Burayd from abi Ja`far (as) that he said: “Allah addressed Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in his book.” I said: “Where?” he (as) said: “In his saying {And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful. But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, judge concerning that which they agreed on, that if Allah put Muhammad to death they shall never return this matter to bani Hashim and then find within themselves no discomfort from your judgement on them to either kill or forgive [them] and that they submit in [full, willing] submission.}”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verse is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of Allah. And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Muhammad], and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful.} [4:64]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.} [4:65]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C- Al-Kulayni trusted the contents of his book and wished for us to adopt them as part of our faith.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Shia will argue: Well, how do we know al-Kulayni believes in these? What if he&#8217;s just collecting narrations in his book without accepting all the contents?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We reply: You do not seem to understand why al-Kulayni authored his book in the first place. He received complains from the Shia that knowledge was being lost and that the people were in great confusion as to what the correct teachings of Ahlul-Bayt are. Al-Kulayni then decided to aid them by collecting the reports he trusts and compiling his book in a way that every Shia belief has reports that back it up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, al-Kulayni lists the Shia beliefs as chapter titles then lists supporting narrations under each chapter to prove that it is from the true Shia faith. While al-Kulayni may not necessarily believe in the authenticity of every individual narration on its own, for instance he may declare a belief then list five narrations under it. Al-Kulayni doesn&#8217;t need to necessarily believe in the authenticity of all five yet it&#8217;s sufficient for him that one or two are authentic and the rest serve as a back-up to reinforce this belief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our case, it is enough for al-Kulayni to mention loads of narrations clearly implying the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an, by doing so he has established this belief even if he doesn&#8217;t necessarily believe every single report is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you will see the words of al-Kulayni and the words of other Shia scholars that clearly point to what we wrote above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni confirmed the authenticity of his reports in the introduction of his book 1/8:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving authentic [Sahih] narrations of the truthful ones (as) and the upright and acted upon traditions from it—through which the compulsory duties of Allah, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled. And you said: ‘If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allah will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.’]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above we conclude that the man clearly asked for reliable authentic teachings, so al-Kulayni answered the call saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Allah, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meaning, he confirms that the book he compiled is indeed sufficient for them and is up to the standards in terms of authenticity and reliability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader and expert in the field of narrations, al-Hurr al-`Amili commented on this in &#8220;Khatimat Tafsil al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221; 30/196:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points. One of these points is: His statement: ‘Authentic narrations.’ It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [Sahih] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-authentic narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will be further explained. Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [Sahih] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness [Tawatur].]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also wrote in &#8220;Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah&#8221; 20/96-97:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The authors of the four books and their likes were more than capable of distinguishing what&#8217;s authentic from what isn&#8217;t. How then is it when we&#8217;re talking about the head of the traditionalists (i.e Kulayni) and the leader of the truthful sect?]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader Husayn al-Nuri al-Tabrasi writes in &#8220;Mustadrak al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221; 3/532:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Kafi from among the four (main) books is like the sun between the stars. If the unbiased one were to contemplate, he&#8217;d realize that there&#8217;s no need to check the condition of individual narrators in its chains. He would feel that it&#8217;s trustworthy and he&#8217;d be at ease with regards to its reports, in terms of their issuance and that they&#8217;re established and authentic.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia Ayatullah Muhammad Mahdi al-Asifi says the following about al-Kafi as is quoted in &#8220;Riyad al-Masa&#8217;il&#8221; by Sayyid `Ali Tabataba&#8217;i 1/31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He—may Allah have mercy on him—has collected what he found authentic from the narrations of the guiding Imams (as) in this encyclopedia of his (i.e al-Kafi).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia Ayatullah abu Talib al-Tabrizi confirms this in &#8220;Mu`jam al-Mahasin&#8221; pg.17:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (i.e al-Kulayni) has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction, when he said: ‘Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving authentic [Sahih] narrations of the truthful ones (as)…’ to: ‘Allah, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.’]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Din al-Musawi wrote in letter 110 of &#8220;Al-Muraja`at&#8221; pg.311:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Kafi, al-Tahdhib, al-Istibsar and Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqi are mass transmitted, their contents are certainly authentic and al-Kafi is the oldest, best and most accurate of them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Fayd al-Kashani wrote in the second introduction of &#8220;Al-Wafi&#8221; pg.23:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The authors of both books (al-Kafi &amp; al-Faqih) have taken the path recognized by the early scholars by declaring as authentic [Sahih] what they rely upon and feel comfortable towards. They have declared the authenticity of all the content in their two books from the narrations, even if much of it would not be considered correct according to the standards of the late scholars.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their popular scholar `Abdul-Rasul al-Ghafar wrote in &#8220;Al-Kulayni wal-Kafi&#8221; pg.391-392:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When al-Kulayni sensed the need and realized the necessity of such a book, he began working on &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; and was cautious to not include in it except what is authentic from the reports of Ahlul-Bayt (as). This is why he struggled for twenty years, comparing narrations, scrutinizing them, researching their chains, narrators and texts. (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) Knowing that he lived in the period of minor occultation, where he was near the four emissaries and so he would visit them as well as the representatives of the (hidden) Imam (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other Shia scholars admitted that al-Kulayni believed in the authenticity of his book but they said his opinions are not binding as he can make mistakes in judging the authenticity of these reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sayyid Muhammad Mujahid al-Tabataba&#8217;i writes in &#8220;Mafatih al-Usul&#8221; pg.332:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Indeed, the testimony of al-Kulayni concerning the authenticity of (the narrations) he has recorded in al-Kafi, just as it is possible that it is in consideration of his knowledge and certainty of their issuance from the Imams (as), in which case it is permissible to depend upon them and its status will be the same as of all the reports of just individuals, it is (also) possible that it is in consideration of his independent judgment [Ijtihad] and their appearance to him on the basis of conjectural proof. In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [Mujtahid] is not proof for those of the same stature.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief he says al-Kulayni&#8217;s Ijtihad is not binding upon other scholars since they can differ in their judgment of what&#8217;s authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah Husayn `Ali al-Muntazari writes in &#8220;Dirasat fil-Makasib al-Muharramah&#8221; 3/123:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The belief of al-Kulayni about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D- Objections or arguments that may arise in opposition to the above.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here we reach the end of our article and we shall mention our opponent&#8217;s weak defense to what we established above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Their first argument will be: Kulayni says to refer back to Allah&#8217;s book and dismiss what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We answer: Why didn&#8217;t he dismiss them then? Instead, we find that he includes them and quotes a lot of them in his book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because the above is listed in the introduction of al-Kafi, the context is that the man was describing to al-Kulayni how it is impossible for him and his people to differentiate between all contradicting narrations coming from  the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why al-Kulayni&#8217;s book does not have much contradictions, since al-Kulayni did not include the reports that oppose what he thinks are the correct teaching of Ahlul-Bayt. Al-Kulayni included only what he wished for the Shia to adhere to including plenty of reports about Tahrif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni tells the man in the introduction that the Imams specified three ways to distinguish what&#8217;s correctly attributed to them:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Present the conflicting reports to Allah&#8217;s book and reject what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(This does not conflict with the belief in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, because al-Kulayni and his likes believed the Qur&#8217;an was simply missing some of `Ali&#8217;s merits and the flaws of his opponents. As for the general context and rulings, they are intact and thus one is able to present narrations to it and see which ones hold-up.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Present the conflicting reports to the beliefs of Ahlul-Sunnah and dismiss what agrees with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Ahlul-Sunnah believe the Qur&#8217;an is un-distorted and so the opposite would be to accept the Shia reports declaring the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Follow the consensus of the Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Shia have a lot of disagreements and that&#8217;s why Kulayni wrote al-Kafi in the first place. This option is invalid)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Their second argument will be: A narration is reported in al-Kafi 8/53 that implies the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered.</p>
<p>The report in question is regarding a letter by abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) Yazid bin `Abdullah, from whoever told him, he said: Abu Ja`far (as) wrote etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The long narration continues with the Imam criticizing the commoners until he writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The result of their abandonment of the Book, is that they upheld its letters but distorted its limits. They read it but do not care for it, so the ignorant among them is pleased with their memorization whereas the scholars are aggrieved at their lack of care]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We answer: This does not mean that the Qur&#8217;an is unchanged. When the Imam says &#8220;They upheld its letters but distorted its limits&#8221; he means that they took great care of reciting it in the best manner and cared more for the pronunciation of its letters than they did for respecting its laws, limits and rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their renowned scholar Al-Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani writes in &#8220;Al-Durar al-Najafiyyah&#8221; 4/69:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the narration in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221;, what&#8217;s apparent is that it means that the commoners upheld the letters &#8211; meaning, by reciting with good voices and adhering to the etiquette of recitation as well as all favorable means they established among themselves, in addition to finishing its entire recitation on a regular basis. However, they corrupted its limits by giving it their own personal interpretations without returning back to the people of revelation (i.e Imams) to learn its laws and prohibitions. This is what&#8217;s apparent from the narration, thus it contains no evidence for what they claim.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, al-Bahrani is disproving those who argued with the report to prove the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered and un-corrupted, he answered as you saw above by saying this is clearly not the case and the report does not constitute legitimate evidence for their stance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope that this is sufficient evidence for all those with intellect that al-Kulayni is one of the staunchest believers in Tahrif, that this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; accusation as they claim and we hope that the article is a solid testament to the corruption of Twelver Shia faith.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (d.1111 AH) also known as al-`Allamah is the father of modern day Shiasm, he was the top and most influential scholar in the Safavid empire and the author of the biggest Shia Hadith encyclopedia &#8220;Bihar-ul-Anwar al-Jami`li Durar Akhbar al-A&#8217;immah al-Athar&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia would like to argue that the man does not believe in Tahrif or the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an. They believe he is innocent of this. In order to support their view, the average Shia laymen will bring forth the following quote, half a sentence from the man&#8217;s book and claim it to be the ultimate truth in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concerning the following verse {It is we who have revealed the remembrance and we are the Guardians} We find in Bihar-ul-Anwar 9/113 this interpretation:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ أي القرآن وَ إِنَّا لَهُ لَحافِظُونَ عن الزيادة و النقصان و التغيير و التحريف و قيل نحفظه من كيد المشركين فلا يمكنهم إبطاله و لا يندرس و لا ينسى و قيل المعنى و إنا لمحمد حافظون‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[{It is we who have revealed the remembrance} Meaning the Qur&#8217;an. {And we are the Guardians} Meaning guarding it from additions, deletions, alterations and corruption. It was also said: Guarding it from the schemes of the polytheists who won&#8217;t be able to destroy it or cause it to be lost and forgotten. It was also said {We are the Guardians} Meaning to Guard Muhammad.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At a first glance you think it is odd, since al-Majlisi writes in his books things such as the following from Hayat-ul-Qulub (translated from Persian) 2/541 onward:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إن علي بن أبي طالب وليي، ووصيي، وخليفتي من بعدي، ولكن أصحابه عملوا عمل قوم موسى، فاتبعوا عجل هذه الأمة وسامريها أعني أبا بكر وعمر فغصب المنافقون خلافته، خلافة رسول الله، وتجاوزوا إلى خليفة الله أي الكتاب الذي أنزله فحرفوه، وغيروه، وعملوا به ما أرادوه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet (saw) announced at Ghadir that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8220;`Ali bin abi Talib is my beloved friend, executor of my will and my successor after me.&#8221; (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) However, his Companions committed the acts of Musa&#8217;s (as) folks and followed the calf  and Samaritan of this nation -He means Abu Bakr and `Umar- and so the hypocrites usurped his right to succession, the succession to the Messenger of Allah (saw). They exceeded this to Allah&#8217;s successor -Meaning the revealed Book- so they corrupted it, altered it and did with it what they please.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the English version translated online by (Sayyid Athar Husayn S.H. Rizvi), the readers can also find this in volume 2 under the title &#8220;The Prophet informs that a great mischief has entered Medina at night&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[After doing this to one Caliph of God, then the other Caliph, which was the book of God they mutilated and changed and made it into what they pleased. (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) The love of Abu Bakr had deep roots in their hearts just as in the hearts of Bani Israel were devoted to the calf and Samiri]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And if the reader was to refer to volume 3 of that same book, he would see plenty of narrations quoted by al-Majlisi claiming that verses were revealed in a very different way than the way we have them now. For instance he will quote a Qur&#8217;anic verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And say: The truth is from your Lord, so let him who please believe, and let him who please disbelieve} [18:29]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he wrote under it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn Mahyar has related from Imam Sadiq (as) that this verse was revealed in this way: &#8220;And say: the truth is from your Lord <span style="color: #ff0000;">about the Wilayah(authority) of Ali bin Abi Talib</span>, so let him who please believe, and let him who please disbelieve&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These types of texts clearly imply that he doesn&#8217;t think the Qur&#8217;an is free from corruption, so how can we reconcile between this and the above statement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well for those familiar with Shia beliefs the reconciliation is quite easy. Fact is that the above interpretation does not mean in any way that al-Majlisi believes in the protection of our Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reason being, is that many Shia hold the belief that Allah is guarding the Qur&#8217;an even though they&#8217;re still believing in Tahrif! How you ask?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well they hold the belief that the complete and legitimate Qur&#8217;an was collected by Ali whereas the Companions collected an inferior version which they played with and corrupted.The Companions refused Ali&#8217;s correct collection so `Ali handed it to his children to guard it and never showed it to anyone. Today, they believe that the complete and correct Qur&#8217;an is still in the possession of their hidden leader (12th Imam). In this way they believe that YES Allah is in fact guarding the correct Qur&#8217;an from harm and corruption by keeping it safe with His representative the hidden Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, in Bihar al-Anwar 99/126 al-Majlisi quotes the narration of their Imam `Ali al-Hadi who is teaching his companion a supplication. In this supplication the 12 Imams are mentioned and glorified. They&#8217;re described as many things such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وَ حَمَلَةِ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ وَ أَوْصِيَاءِ نَبِيِّ اللَّهِ وَ ذُرِّيَّةِ رَسُولِ اللَّه‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(They) are the carriers of Allah&#8217;s Book, the legatees of Allah&#8217;s prophet, the progeny of the Messenger of Allah etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi comments in Bihar al-Awar 99/136:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">و حملة كتاب الله أي عندهم تمام الكتاب على ما نزل من غير نقص و تغيير و معناه و تأويله و بطونه و ذرية رسول الله‏</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">[The &#8220;Carriers of Allah&#8217;s Book&#8221; (i.e. Imams) Meaning those who have the complete Qur&#8217;an, as it was revealed, without any loss, addition or change. They know its explanation, its interpretation and its hidden meanings.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see dear reader, the ones who have the complete unchanged Qur&#8217;an are the 12 Shia Imams, that&#8217;s how they believe it&#8217;s preserved unlike the one in our hands today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not the end of it though, we all know that al-Majlisi&#8217;s Bihar encyclopedia is so big -110 volumes in total- that it contains many other books inside it. Yes, al-Majlisi in his Bihar quotes entire other books and treatise by earlier Shia scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an un-informed reader, you&#8217;d think that the above interpretation is by al-Majlisi himself. Truth however is that the above words are not his own, the interpretation of the verses are copied and summarized by him from the book of al-Fadl bin al-Hasan al-Tabrasi (d.548 AH).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi writes the above interpretations in a section he called &#8220;تفسير الآيات&#8221; meaning &#8220;Interpreting the verses&#8221;. This is a large section but it isn&#8217;t his own words rather those of abu `Ali al-Fadl al-Tabrasi. It is sufficient to go a couple of pages back to the beginning of the section on interpretation and read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bihar al-Anwar 9/64:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">تفسير قال الطبرسي رحمه الله في قوله تعالى‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Tafsir: Al-Tabrasi may Allah have mercy on him said regarding The Most High&#8217;s words etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then to confirm, we open the book Majma`-ul-Bayan fi Tafsir al-Qur&#8217;an by al-Fadl al-Tabrasi, on the chapter of Surat-ul-Hijr, verse 9, we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">فقال { إنا نحن نزلنا الذكر } أي القرآن { وإنا له لحافظون } عن الزيادة والنقصان والتحريف والتغيير <span style="color: #333333;">عن قتادة</span></span> وابن عباس ومثله لا يأتيه الباطل من بين يديه ولا من خلفه وقيل معناه متكفل بحفظه إلى آخر الدهر على ما هو عليه فتنقله الأمة وتحفظه عصراً بعد عصر إلى يوم القيامة لقيام الحجة به على الجماعة من كل من لزمته دعوة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عن الحسن <span style="color: #ff0000;">وقيل يحفظه من كيد المشركين ولا يمكنهم إبطاله ولا يندرس ولا ينسى</span> عن الجبائي وقال الفراء يجوز أن يكون الهاء في له كناية عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فكأنه قال <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">إنا نزلنا القرآن</span> وإنا لمحمد صلى الله عليه وسلم لحافظون</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, the parts in red are word for word and letter for letter what al-Majlisi quoted from al-Fadl al-Tabrasi. All al-Majlisi did was remove the unnecessary filling content such as the names of folks who held these opinions (Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Jaba&#8217;i, Farra&#8217;) as well as  references to other verses for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is therefore inaccurate to attribute the above to al-Majlisi and consider it his opinion since he&#8217;s simply quoting the words of an early Shia Mufassir without commenting on it. Furthermore, the Shia Mufassir himself (i.e. al-Fadl al-Tabrasi) is quoting Sunni &amp; Mu`tazili opinions and narrations so it isn&#8217;t even the Shia interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s as far as the deceptive Shia defense and below I will share with you more facts so that by the end of this piece you will be convinced without the shadow of a doubt that the man openly believes in Tahrif and you will see the truth of what we say.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, if I was a scholar who did not believe in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, would I include entire chapters in my books that speak of how the Qur&#8217;an was corrupted and changed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In volume 89 of his Bihar encyclopedia, al-Majlisi writes about many topics pertaining to the Qur&#8217;an. He includes several chapters about Tahrif and cites many evidences to show the strength of this belief in Shia creed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He begins in al-Bihar 89/40:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">باب ما جاء في كيفية جمع القرآن و ما يدل على تغييره‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Chapter: What&#8217;s mentioned regarding the collection of the Qur&#8217;an and the proof that it was distorted.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi literally fills this chapter with texts proving the Qur&#8217;an was corrupted from page 40 until page 66.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the while making comments like these, such as in al-Bihar 89/48:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أقول: قد وردت أخبار كثيرة في كثير من الآيات أنها نزلت على خلاف القراءات المشهورة كآية الكرسي و قوله وَ كَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَسَطاً و غيرهما</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: Many narrations have reached us regarding many verses, that the way they were revealed was different than the popular recitations. Such as Ayat-ul-Kursi and Allah&#8217;s words: &#8220;Thus we have made you moderate Imams&#8221; as well as others.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need not remind you that the real verse reads like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Thus We made you a moderate community} [2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s quote an example from the type of reports in these pages as well as al-Majlisi&#8217;s commentary on it. We read in al-Bihar 89/60:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنِ ابْنِ نُبَاتَةَ قَالَ: سَمِعْتُ عَلِيّاً ع يَقُولُ كَأَنِّي بِالْعَجَمِ فَسَاطِيطُهُمْ فِي مَسْجِدِ الْكُوفَةِ يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ الْقُرْآنَ كَمَا أُنْزِلَ قُلْتُ يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَ وَ لَيْسَ هُوَ كَمَا أُنْزِلَ فَقَالَ لَا مُحِيَ مِنْهُ سَبْعُونَ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ- بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ وَ أَسْمَاءِ آبَائِهِمْ وَ مَا تُرِكَ أَبُو لَهَبٍ إِلَّا لِلْإِزْرَاءِ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ص- لِأَنَّهُ عَمُّهُ<br />
أقول: سيأتي في تفسير النعماني ما يدل على التغيير و التحريف‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(&#8230;) from Ibn Nabatah, he said: I heard `Ali (as) say: &#8220;It is as if I can see (in the future) the foreigners setting up their tents near the mosque of Kufah, teaching people the Qur&#8217;an as it was (correctly) revealed.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O chief of believers, is the Qur&#8217;an (today) not as Allah revealed it?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;No, the names of seventy individuals from Quraysh and the names of their fathers were erased from it. They had only left the name of abu Lahab to mock the Messenger (saw) since he was his uncle.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let&#8217;s read al-Majlisi&#8217;s commentary, will he defend the Qur&#8217;an since he doesn&#8217;t believe in Tahrif as they claim? He writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: In Tafsri al-Nu`mani shall come what proves the distortion and corruption.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MashaAllah, it seems he wishes to give us more evidences of the corruption and distortion. In fact, on the same page he starts copying the full treatise by the Persian Shia scholar Sa`d al-Ash`ari al-Qummi as reported by their narrator Ibn Qawlawayh. This treatise offers an entire long list of verses that were distorted and what they were actually supposed to be before corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">جَعْفَرُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ قُولَوَيْهِ عَنْ سَعْدٍ الْأَشْعَرِيِّ الْقُمِّيِّ أَبِي الْقَاسِمِ رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ وَ هُوَ مُصَنِّفُهُ رَوَى مَشَايِخُنَا عَنْ أَصْحَابِنَا عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ع قَالَ قَالَ أَمِيرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ وَ سَاقَ الْحَدِيثَ إِلَى أَنْ قَالَ بَابُ التَّحْرِيفِ فِي الْآيَاتِ الَّتِي هِيَ خِلَافُ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ مِمَّا رَوَاهُ مَشَايِخُنَا رَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِمْ عَنِ الْعُلَمَاءِ مِنْ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَوَاتُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَ عَلَيْهِم‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ja`far bin Muhammad bin Qawlawayh, from Sad al-Ashari al-Qummi abi al-Qasim may Allah have mercy on him who is the author, he says: Our teachers narrated from our companions, from abi `Abdillah (as) that he said: The chief of believers (as) said: And he mentions the report until he reaches: &#8220;Chapter: On the corruption of verses that are different from what Allah had revealed as narrated by our teachers may Allah&#8217;s mercy be upon them, from the scholars of the family of Muhammad (as).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he begins the treatise with the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ْ قَوْلُهُ جَلَّ وَ عَزَّ كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَ تَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ فَقَالَ أَبُو عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ع لِقَارِئِ هَذِهِ الْآيَةِ وَيْحَكَ خَيْرُ أُمَّةٍ يَقْتُلُونَ ابْنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَوَاتُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَ آلِهِ فَقَالَ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ فَكَيْفَ هِيَ فَقَالَ أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أَئِمَّةٍ أَ مَا تَرَى إِلَى مَدْحِ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ فِي قَوْلِهِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَ تَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ فَمَدْحُهُ لَهُمْ دَلِيلٌ عَلَى أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَعْنِ الْأُمَّةَ بِأَسْرِهَا أَ لَا تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ فِي الْأُمَّةِ الزُّنَاةَ وَ اللَّاطَةَ وَ السُّرَّاقَ وَ قُطَّاعَ الطَّرِيقِ وَ الظَّالِمِينَ وَ الْفَاسِقِينَ أَ فَتَرَى أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَدَحَ هَؤُلَاءِ وَ سَمَّاهُمُ الْآمِرِينَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَ النَّاهِينَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ كَلَّا مَا مَدَحَ اللَّهُ هَؤُلَاءِ وَ لَا سَمَّاهُمْ أَخْيَاراً بَلْ هُمُ الْأَشْرَار</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Allah&#8217;s words {You are the best nation that hath been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah} [3:110] So aba `Abdillah (as) told the reciter: &#8220;Woe to you! The best nation kill the son of the Messenger (saw)!?&#8221; He said: &#8220;May I be your sacrifice! How do I recite it then?&#8221; He (as) answered: &#8220;You are the best Imams that hath been raised for mankind.&#8221; He (as) continued: &#8220;Do you not see Allah&#8217;s praise for them here {Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah} This praise means He never intended the entire nation. Do you not know that this nation includes adulterers, sodomites, thieves, bandits, oppressors and wicked folks? Do you think Allah would praise them and describe them as (etc&#8230;)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he continues with a long list of so called corrupt verses for six pages until he begins a new chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi writes in al-Bihar 89/66:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">باب تأليف القرآن و أنه على غير ما أنزل الله عز و جل‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Chapter: The compilation of the Qur&#8217;an and how it differs from what Allah revealed.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He writes right under this title:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فمن الدلالة عليه في باب الناسخ و المنسوخ منه الآية في عدة النساء في المتوفى عنها زوجها و قد ذكرنا ذلك في باب الناسخ و المنسوخ و احتجنا إلى‏ إعادة ذكره في هذا الباب ليستدل على أن التأليف على خلاف ما أنزل الله جل و عز</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The evidence for this is found in a previous chapter on &#8220;the abrogation and the abrogated&#8221;, such as the verse related to the waiting period a woman must observe after the death of her husband. We only wish to repeat it in this chapter so that we can prove that the compilation (of this Qur&#8217;an) is different from what Allah most glorious revealed.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then al-Majlisi begins citing quite a few examples of how the verses were jumbled up and how our Qur&#8217;an contains verses in incorrect positions that make no sense. We mention a part of what he says as a sample:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فهذه الآية مع قصة إبراهيم صلى الله عليه متصلة بها فقد أخرت و هذا دليل على أن التأليف على غير ما أنزل الله جل و عز في كل وقت للأمور التي كانت تحدث فينزل الله فيها القرآن و قد قدموا و أخروا لقلة معرفتهم بالتأليف و قلة علمهم بالتنزيل على ما أنزله الله و إنما ألفوه بآرائهم و ربما كتبوا الحرف و الآية في غير موضعها الذي يجب قلة معرفة به و لو أخذوه من معدنه الذي أنزل فيه و من أهله الذي نزل عليهم لما اختلف التأليف و لوقف الناس على عامة ما احتاجوا إليه من الناسخ و المنسوخ و المحكم و المتشابه و الخاص و العام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(&#8230;) This verse and the story of Ibrahim (as) are supposed to be connected but it was pushed back and this proves that the compilation is not in accordance with what Allah revealed every time an event took place requiring a verse to descend. They (i.e Sahabah) have advanced some verses (to certain locations) and pushed others back (to other locations) due to their lack of knowledge in both the compilation and the revelation as Allah intended. They (i.e Sahabah) only compiled it based on their own opinions in a way that they&#8217;d write a word or a verse in an incorrect location due to their lack of knowledge. If they had taken it from its rightful source (i.e Ahlul-Bayt) whom it originally was revealed for, and from its rightful people (i.e Ahlul-Bayt) whom it descended on, then the compilation wouldn&#8217;t have differed so much and the people would have been able to acquire what they needed from verses that are abrogated, abrogating, explicit, vague, specific and general.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dear reader is because physical Tahrif is mainly of three kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- Addition (Ziyadah): To believe that compilers inserted into the Qur&#8217;an words that were not revealed by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Deletion (Nuqsan): To believe that compilers removed verses from the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- Order (Tartib): To believe that compilers corrupted the order of the words and the verses in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All three types above are equal in harm and all three distort the original message and prevent people from learning the correct religion as Allah intended for it. So far al-Majlisi has confirmed two from the above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to show you how devastating the third type of Tahrif is and how to distorts the message and corrupts the religious teachings, we will quote al-Majlisi&#8217;s own words about a verse that he believes was removed from its proper context and maliciously inserted into another verse to confuse the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In volume 35, al-Majlisi mentions the verse of purification as evidence for the infallibility of the household. Then he quotes the argument of Ahlul-Sunnah that the verse cannot possibly be talking about the five people of the cloak (Ahlul-Kisa&#8217;) since it is located as part of a verse that is addressing the mothers of believers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The full verse is:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Remain in your houses; and display not your finery, as did the pagans of old. And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and obey God and His Messenger. People of the House, God only desires to put away from you abomination and to cleanse you.} [33:33]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Bihar al-Anwar 35/234:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">بما ستقف عليه في كتاب القرآن مما سننقل من روايات الفريقين أن ترتيب القرآن الذي بيننا ليس من فعل المعصوم حتى لا يتطرق إليه الغلط</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing al-Majlisi does is refer the readers to the chapter we were previously talking about in volume 89 to prove that the order of words and verses is incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[You will see in &#8220;Kitab-ul-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; (i.e volume 89) the reports we copied from both teams (i.e Sunnah &amp; Shia) proving that the order of compilation of the Qur&#8217;an in our hands is not the work of the infallible so that errors may not creep into it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, errors did creep into it and thus our Qur&#8217;an has errors since the compilers were the Companions not the infallible `Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let&#8217;s see how al-Majlisi will refute Ahlul-Sunnah and what his first argument is going to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the same page we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فلعل آية التطهير أيضا وضعوها في موضع زعموا أنها تناسبه أو أدخلوها في سياق مخاطبة الزوجات لبعض مصالحهم الدنيوية و قد ظهر من الأخبار عدم ارتباطها بقصتهن فالاعتماد في هذا الباب على النظم و الترتيب ظاهر البطلان‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It&#8217;s possible that they also placed the verse of purification in a location which they claimed is suitable. They inserted it into the verse addressing the wives for worldly benefits although it&#8217;s been proven from the narrations that it&#8217;s unrelated to their (i.e wives) story and so relying on the order of compilation in this regard is clearly faulty.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here&#8217;s Majlisi&#8217;s first argument, that the Companions shoved one verse in the middle of another verse for worldly benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s see his second argument in al-Bihar 35/235:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و لو سلم عدم التغيير في الترتيب فنقول سيأتي أخبار مستفيضة بأنه سقط من القرآن آيات كثيرة فلعله سقط مما قبل الآية و ما بعدها آيات لو ثبتت لم يفت الربط الظاهري بينها و قد وقع في سورة الأحزاب بعينها ما يشبه هذا فإن الله سبحانه بعد ما خاطب الزوجات بآيات مصدرة بقوله تعالى يا نساء النبي إِنْ كُنْتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ الْحَياةَ الدُّنْيا الآية عدل إلى مخاطبة المؤمنين بما لا تعلق له بالزوجات بآيات كثيرة ثم عاد إلى الأمر بمخاطبتهن و عيرهن بقوله سبحانه يا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُلْ لِأَزْواجِكَ وَ بَناتِكَ وَ نِساءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ و قد عرفت اعتراف الخصم فيما رووا أنه كان قد سقط منها آية فألحقت فلا يستبعد أن يكون الساقط أكثر من آية و لم يلحق غيرها</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[If we agree for the sake of argument that there was no alteration in the order of verses. You will soon see plentiful narrations stating that many verses were dropped from the Qur&#8217;an. Therefore, it&#8217;s possible that the verses preceding it were dropped as well as what came after it but had they been included then the apparent meaning would be suitable. In fact, the chapter of Surat-ul-Ahzab had something similar happen to it, for Allah addressed the wives with verses starting with {O women of the prophet: If you desire the present life and its adornment} then He switched to address the believers in a way that&#8217;s unrelated to the wives in many verses. Then He returned to address them with an order {O Prophet, say to thy wives and daughters and the believing women, that they draw their veils close to them} And you know that the opponents (i.e Sunnies) have admitted in their narrations that a verse was lost from this chapter then it was later inserted, so it isn&#8217;t unlikely that more than one verse were dropped]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all he made a mistake, there&#8217;s no verse that says &#8220;O women of the prophet: If you desire the present life and its adornment&#8221; the man seems to have mixed two verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, his second argument is worse than his first one. He&#8217;s saying if we agree for the sake of argument that Qur&#8217;anic words and verses are properly organized, then we all know that there&#8217;re missing verses that were not included by the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To further clarify and strengthen his argument, he quotes this Shia narration right under the above paragraph:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وَ رَوَى الصَّدُوقُ فِي كِتَابِ ثَوَابِ الْأَعْمَالِ بِإِسْنَادِهِ عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ سِنَانٍ عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ع سُورَةُ الْأَحْزَابِ فِيهَا فَضَائِحُ الرِّجَالِ وَ النِّسَاءِ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَ غَيْرِهِمْ يَا ابْنَ سِنَانٍ إِنَّ سُورَةَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَضَحَتْ نِسَاءَ قُرَيْشٍ مِنَ الْعَرَبِ وَ كَانَتْ أَطْوَلَ مِنْ سُورَةِ الْبَقَرَةِ وَ لَكِنْ نَقَصُوهَا وَ حَرَّفُوهَا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Saduq reported in the book &#8220;Thawab-ul-Amal&#8221; from the path of `Abdullah bin Sinan, from abu `Abdullah (as): O ibn Sinan, Surat-ul-Ahzab contained the scandals of the men and women of Quraysh as well as others. Surat-ul-Ahzab exposed the women of Quraysh from the Arabs and was longer than Surat-ul-Baqarah but they removed from it and corrupted it]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ask the Shia, do these arguments sound like arguments coming from a man who doesn&#8217;t believe in Tahrif? When you debate Ahlul-Sunnah do you people also use arguments like these?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that things have been clarified for unbiased reader, we will go even further to quote some of the commentaries of al-Majlisi on various Shia narrations that declare the Qur&#8217;an to be corrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Maladh-ul-Akhiyar 1/259, al-Majlisi comments on a narration in Tahdhib-ul-Akhbar by al-Tusi:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">َ سَأَلْتُ أَبَا عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ع عَنْ قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى- فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَ أَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرافِقِ فَقَالَ لَيْسَ هَكَذَا تَنْزِيلُهَا إِنَّمَا هِيَ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَ أَيْدِيَكُمْ مِنَ الْمَرافِقِ ثُمَّ أَمَرَّ يَدَهُ مِنْ مِرْفَقِهِ إِلَى أَصَابِعِه‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration says [I asked aba `Abdillah (as) about Allah&#8217;s words {Wash your faces and hands <span style="color: #ff0000;">until</span> the elbows} [5:6] He (as) replied: This isn&#8217;t how it was revealed, it is {Wash your faces and hands <span style="color: #ff0000;">from</span> the elbows.} Then he (as) passed his hand from his elbow until his fingers.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no secret that the Imam here is saying the Qur&#8217;an is incorrect. Al-Majlisi writes below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و قال الفاضل البهائي رحمه الله: لعل المراد من التنزيل التأويل، كما يقال: ينبغي تنزيل الحديث على كذا، و إلا فهي متواترة فكيف يمكن نفيها. انتهى. و يرد عليه: أنه إن أردتم تواترها إلى القراء أو تواتر ما اشترك بينها إلى من جمع القرآن فمسلم، و أما تواترها عن النبي صلى الله عليه و آله فغير مسلم. و قد دلت الأخبار المتواترة بالمعنى على النقص و التغيير في الجملة، لكن لا يمكن الجزم في خصوص موضع، و أمرنا بقراءته و العمل به على ما ضبطه القراء إلى أن يظهر القائم عليه السلام‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Fadil al-Baha&#8217;i may Allah have mercy on him said: Maybe what is meant by &#8220;This isn&#8217;t how it was revealed&#8221; is the divine interpretation, for example they say: &#8220;The narration was revealed for such and such&#8221; Otherwise, it (i.e the verse) is mass transmitted so we cannot reject it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Majlisi says) We can respond to him that: If you mean that it is mass transmitted up until the reciters or those who compiled the Qur&#8217;an then we accept this. However, if you mean that it is mass transmitted from the Prophet (saw) then this is not accepted. The mass transmitted narrations have generally proved the deletion and distortion but we cannot be certain about a certain location. We&#8217;ve been ordered to recite it and work with it according to how the reciters transmitted it until al-Qa&#8217;im (i.e 12th Imam) appears.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is very interesting, we see a narration clearly imply Tahrif. Al-Baha&#8217;i says maybe what&#8217;s meant is the divine interpretation and not that the verse itself is corrupted. He argues that the verse is mass transmitted so how can we reject it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi refutes him by saying it&#8217;s not true that the verse is mass transmitted from the Prophet (saw). He says it is mass transmitted from the reciters hinting that the mass transmission took place after the verses were corrupted by the Companions. Then he says that mass transmitted reports all stated that the Qur&#8217;an was indeed a victim of deletion and distortion. Finally, he says they were ordered to recite Qur&#8217;an as the people of Sunnah do until the 12th rises with the complete Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi wrote his book &#8220;Mir&#8217;at-ul-`Uqul&#8221; to comment on the authenticity and interpretation of the narrations in al-Kafi by al-Kulayni.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may have read above that al-Majlisi suggested that Ayat-ul-Kursi has been corrupted. The story is that al-Kulayni and `Ali bin Ibrahim both quote narrations in their books where this verse is different than the one we have in our Qur&#8217;an today. Below is al-Majlisi&#8217;s commentary on the narration of al-Kafi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He writes in al-Mir&#8217;at 26/314 regarding narration #437:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و هذا الخبر يدل على أنه قد أسقط من آية الكرسي كلمات و قد ورد في بعض الأدعية المأثورة فليكتب آية الكرسي على التنزيل، و هو إشارة إلى هذا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This report is evidence that Ayat-ul-Kursi is missing some words. It has been mentioned in the supplications of the Imams that one must &#8220;Write Ayat-ul-Kursi as it was revealed&#8221; and that points towards this.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then quotes the narration from Tafsir al-Qummi as support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in al-Mir&#8217;at 26/77, Majlisi authenticates narration #212 which talks about the corruption of Surat-ul-Nisa&#8217; verse 59:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original verse is like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّـهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{If you disagree on a matter then return it to Allah and the Messenger} [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the narration states that abu Ja`far al-Baqir recited it like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ تَنَازُعاً فِي الْأَمْرِ فَأَرْجِعُوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَ إِلَى أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُم‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;If you fear disagreement in the matter then return it to Allah, to his Messenger and those in authority among you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So al-Majlisi wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قوله عليه السلام:&#8221; فإن خفتم تنازعا&#8221; ظاهره أنها هكذا نزلت، و يحتمل أن يكون الغرض تفسير الآية بأنه ليس المراد تنازع الرعية و أولي الأمر، كما ذهب إليه أكثر المفسرين، بل هو خطاب للمأمورين الذين قيل لهم&#8221; أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ&#8221; أي إن اشتبه عليكم أمر و خفتم فيه تنازعا، لعدم علمكم به، فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَ الرَّسُولِ و الرد إلى أولي الأمر أيضا داخل في الرد إلى الرسول، لأنهم إنما أخذوا علمهم عنه، و ظاهر كثير من الأخبار أن قوله:&#8221; وَ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ&#8221; كان مثبتا هيهنا فأسقط</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[His saying (as): &#8220;If you fear disagreement&#8221; is apparent in that this is how it was revealed. It&#8217;s possible that the purpose is to interpret the verse that what&#8217;s intended is not a disagreement between the subjects and those in authority like most Mufassirin said. Rather it is addressing those who were told {Obey Allah} meaning if the matter got confusing and feared it could lead to a conflict then return it to Allah and the Messenger. Returning the matter to those in authority is also included when returning things to the Messenger since they took their knowledge from him. What&#8217;s apparent from many narrations that {And those in authority among you} was established in the verse but was dropped.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi admits that the apparent wording of the narration shows that this is indeed how it was revealed according to their Imam. Then he states that many narrations show that a part of the verse was dropped towards the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Mir&#8217;at 26/316 #439 he comments on the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger} [2:214]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, their Imam recites in the narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">َ سَمِعْتُ أَبَا عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ع يَقْرَأُ- وَ زُلْزِلُوا ثُمَّ زُلْزِلُوا- حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُول‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;And were shaken <span style="color: #ff0000;">then shaken</span> until [even their] messenger&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و الظاهر أنه كان عن بكر بن محمد فزيد فيه- أبي- من النساخ و يدل على أنه سقط عن الآية قوله- ثم زلزلوا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What&#8217;s apparent is that it was (narrated) from Bakr bin Muhammad but the word &#8220;father&#8221; had been added by the copyist. This also proves that the part &#8220;then shaken&#8221; was dropped from the verse.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, al-Majlisi comments on the narration of their Imams that the Qur&#8217;an revealed upon Muhammad (saw) is seventeen-thousand verses. This is in al-Mir&#8217;at 12/525 #28:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فالخبر صحيح و لا يخفى أن هذا الخبر و كثير من الأخبار الصحيحة صريحة في نقص القرآن و تغييره، و عندي أن الأخبار في هذا الباب متواترة معنى، و طرح جميعها يوجب رفع الاعتماد عن الأخبار رأسا بل ظني أن الأخبار في هذا الباب لا يقصر عن أخبار الإمامة فكيف يثبتونها بالخبر</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The narration is authentic and it is no secret that many from the authentic narrations are explicit in that the Qur&#8217;an suffered from deletion and corruption. In my view, the narrations in this regard (i.e narrations of Tahrif) are mass transmitted in meaning and so discarding all of them would lead to the rejection of all our narrations in general. I actually think that the narrations in this regard are not any less than the narrations concerning Imamah]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Mir&#8217;at al-Uqul 3/31 al-Majlisi comments on their narration that nobody claimed to have collected the full Qur&#8217;an except `Ali bin abi Talib:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ما ادعى أحد أي غير الأئمة عليهم السلام و المراد بالقرآن كله ألفاظه و حروفه جميعا، و المراد بكما أنزل، ترتيبه و إعرابه و حركاته و سكناته و حدود الآي و السور، و هذا رد على قوم زعموا أن القرآن ما في المصاحف المشهورة، و كما قرأه القراء السبعة و أضرابهم‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The words &#8220;Nobody claimed&#8221; means nobody except the Imams (as), and what&#8217;s meant by &#8220;collected the Qur&#8217;an&#8221; means in its entirety, with all its words and letters. What&#8217;s meant by &#8220;As it was revealed&#8221; means the order of verses, the grammatical marks and stops, the limits of verses and chapters. This (narration) refutes those folks who claim that the Qur&#8217;an is what is now found within the widespread Masahif or what the seven reciters and their likes have recited]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can observe, the man is very open that what&#8217;s found today is not the correct Qur&#8217;an. He literally says the narration refutes those who claim the Qur&#8217;an is what is found with us today!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و اختلف أصحابنا في ذلك، فذهب الصدوق ابن بابويه و جماعة إلى أن القرآن لم يتغير عما أنزل و لم ينقص منه شي‏ء، و ذهب الكليني و الشيخ المفيد قدس الله روحهما و جماعة إلى أن جميع القرآن عند الأئمة عليهم السلام، و ما في المصاحف بعضه‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our Companions differed in this, al-Saduq ibn Babuwayh and a group held the opinion that the Qur&#8217;an was not changed from how it was revealed nor is anything missing. Whereas, al-Kulayni, Shaykh al-Mufid and a group may Allah sanctify their souls believed that the entire Qur&#8217;an is with the Imams (as) and what we have with us in our Mushaf today is a part of it]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And to which group do you think al-Majlisi belongs dear reader?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و جمع أمير المؤمنين صلوات الله عليه كما أنزل بعد الرسول صلى الله عليه و آله و سلم و أخرج إلى الصحابة المنافقين فلم يقبلوا منه، و هم قصدوا لجمعه في زمن عمر و عثمان‏ كما سيأتي تفصيله في كتاب القرآن‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The chief of believers (as) collected it as it was revealed after the Messenger of Allah (saw) and he brought it out to the hypocrite Companions who refused it. They sought to collect it in `Umar and `Uthman&#8217;s reigns as you will see in detail in Kitab-ul-Qur&#8217;an (i.e volume 89)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s the typical Shia story believed by the vast majority of scholars, do you think they&#8217;ll accept that `Ali&#8217;s compilation is similar to ours? Of course they&#8217;ll say the one collected by the Companions is inferior to the one collected by `Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he quotes al-Mufid in al-Masa&#8217;il al-Sarawiyyah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال شيخنا السديد المفيد روح الله روحه في جواب المسائل السروية</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief al-Mufid declares the Qur&#8217;an to be missing verses, he describes `Ali&#8217;s perfect Qur&#8217;an and says in the end that the Imams ordered us to recite our Qur&#8217;an until the Qa&#8217;im rises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi concludes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و الأخبار من طريق الخاصة و العامة في النقص و التغيير متواترة، و العقل يحكم بأنه إذ كان القرآن متفرقا منتشرا عند الناس، و تصدي غير المعصوم لجمعه يمتنع عادة أن يكون جمعه كاملا موافقا للواقع، لكن لا ريب في أن الناس مكلفون بالعمل بما في المصاحف و تلاوته حتى يظهر القائم عليه السلام، و هذا معلوم متواتر من طريق أهل البيت عليهم السلام و أكثر أخبار هذا الباب مما يدل على النقص و التغيير و سيأتي كثير منها في الأبواب‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The narrations from the path of the Shia and the mainstream Muslims regarding deletion and distortion are mass transmitted. The intellect judges that if the Qur&#8217;an was spread in various locations with different people, then a group of non-infallible men were tasked with collecting it, it&#8217;s natural that it won&#8217;t be collected in its entirety or in accordance with how it was revealed. No doubt, the people are religiously obliged to adhere to what&#8217;s in the Mushaf (today), they are to recite it (as it is) until al-Qa&#8217;im (as) appears. This is known and mass transmitted from the way of Ahlul-Bayt (as) and most narrations in this topic are proofs for deletions and corruption and you will see much of it in the (following) chapters]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man&#8217;s creed is crystal by now I suppose, no need for comments. He believes in Tahrif and this inferior Qur&#8217;an of ours, we&#8217;re stuck with it until the brave hidden leader comes out of his hole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it should not come as a shock that al-Majlisi&#8217;s students also believe in the same thing, for example Ni`matullah al-Jaza&#8217;iri. Even his family members held the same beliefs, al-Majlis will tell us of his father&#8217;s beliefs below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi quotes the words of his father Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi in al-Fawa&#8217;id al-Tarifah fi Sharh al-Sahifah al-Sharifah pg.58:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When discussing this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And [remember, O Muhammad], when We told you, &#8220;Indeed, your Lord has encompassed the people.&#8221; And We did not make the sight which We showed you except as a trial for the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur&#8217;an. And We threaten them, but it increases them not except in great transgression.} [17:60]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال الوالد العلامة قدس الله روحه: أي ما جعلنا حكاية الشجرة الملعونة في القرآن الا فتنة للناس وامتحانا لهم, والظاهر أن هذه  تخصيص بعد تعميم, لان الرؤيا أعم من بني أمية وغيرهم من التيمي والعدوي وبني العباس, والظاهر أن لعنهم كان في القرآن صريحا فاسقطه عنه الثلاثة كما ورد في الأخبار (ونخوفهم ) أي الناس لئلا يتابعوا أئمة الجور أو التابعين و المتبوعين. أنتهى كلامه رفع الله مقامه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[My father, the grand scholar may Allah sanctify his soul said: &#8220;This means, we only mentioned the story of the cursed tree in the Qur&#8217;an as a trial to test the people. What&#8217;s apparent is that it&#8217;s a specification after a generalization, since its sight is more general than that of Banu Umayyah, the Taymi (i.e Abu Bakr), the `Adawi (i.e `Umar) and Banu al-`Abbas because what&#8217;s apparent is that they were (all) cursed clearly in the Qur&#8217;an but the three (i.e first three Caliphs) have erased it from the Qur&#8217;an as the narrations stated. His word {We threaten them} meaning the people so they wouldn&#8217;t follow the tyrant leaders and their followers.&#8221; His words end here may Allah raise his rank.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this cursed tree, which they believe refers to Banu Umayyah, is also referring to Abu Bakr, `Umar and Banu al-`Abbas who were all clearly cursed in the Qur&#8217;an but the evil Caliphs distorted Allah&#8217;s book and erased their names.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, we would have quoted the words of some Shia scholars who admitted that al-Majlisi believes in Tahrif however do we really need to? A person would have to be quite thick headed in order to not see this truth. If al-Majlisi&#8217;s own words aren&#8217;t sufficient for some then nobody else can convince them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mirza abu al-Qasim bin Muhammad Hasan al-Qummi (d.1231 AH) in his book al-Qawanin al-Muhkamah fil-Usoul vol.2 discusses the Qur&#8217;an and its preservation. The text is advanced and the author&#8217;s weak Arabic requires us to explain some of the texts we&#8217;re quoting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He begins on page 321 by stating his opinion:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أما تواتر القرآن في الجملة ووجوب العمل بما في أيدينا اليوم فمما لا شك فيه ولا شبهة تعتريه لكن تواتر جميع ما نزل على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله غير معلوم وكذا وجوب تواتره</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the Qur&#8217;an being Mutawatir in general and the necessity of using whatever is in our hands today (from Allah&#8217;s book) then there are no doubts about this. However, the Tawatur of all the revelation that Muhammad (saw) received is not confirmed nor is the necessity of its Tawatur.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: He is saying that the Qur&#8217;an we have in our hands today is mass transmitted and we must utilize it to extract rulings BUT it&#8217; not confirmed that this Qur&#8217;an contains all the revealed verses nor that all of those revelations reached us through mass transmission, such a matter isn&#8217;t necessary in his opinion. (You will see why below)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What he means above is that the Qur&#8217;an became mass transmitted after certain alterations took place. (As you will also see below)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues on the same page by informing us of why Tawatur can&#8217;t be claimed for all revelation. He does so by showing that the Shia differed on the matter of the corruption of Allah&#8217;s book and lists examples of scholars who believe and others who disbelieve in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then quotes some books containing narrations and how some scholars dealt with them or how they explained corruption to be related to the interpretation of verses. Then on page 326 he writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ثم ذكر قول الصحابة لنبيهم صلى الله عليه وآله على الحوض إذا سئلهم كيف خلفتموني في الثقلين من بعدي فيقولون أما الأكبر فحرفناه وبدلناه وأما الأصغر فقتلناه ثم يذادون عن الحوض وأما الدليل على الثاني فقوله تعالى لا يأتيه الباطل من بين يديه ولا من خلفه ولا دلالة فيه أصلا كما لا يخفى وقوله تعالى إنا نحن نزلنا الذكر وإنا له لحافظون وفيه أنه لا يدل على عدم التغيير في القرآن الذي بأيدينا فيكفي كونه محفوظا عند الأئمة عليهم السلام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then he mentioned the saying of the Companions to the Prophet (saw) on the fount when he (saw) asks: &#8220;How did you succeed me in the two weighty things?&#8221; They reply: &#8220;As for the bigger one we corrupted it and changed it. As for the smallest of the two, we have murdered them. So they are chased away from the fount. Regarding the evidence for the second, it is Allah&#8217;s words {Falsehood shall not approach it from in front of it nor from behind} This (verse) does not constitute evidence ( for its preservation) as is clear. Then there is Allah&#8217;s saying {It is we who have revealed the remembrance and it is we who shall guard it} This (too) does not prove that the Qur&#8217;an in our hands is safe from corruption for it is sufficient that the Imams (as) have it preserved with them]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: You can see that he writes above that the two verses are not acceptable evidence to prove that the Qur&#8217;an we have in our hands today is unchanged. He says it can simply mean that it&#8217;s preserved with the 12 Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ولا ريب أن ما في أيدينا أيضا محفوظ من أن يتطرق إليه نقص آخر أو زيادة مع احتمال أن يراد من قوله تعالى لحافظون لعالمون</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[No doubt that what is in our hands is also preserved from undergoing other deletions or an addition, taking into account that it&#8217;s possible that the meaning of {It is we who shall guard it} means &#8220;Know it&#8221;.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Notice that he says &#8220;what we have today is safe from undergoing other deletions&#8221; Meaning, the Qur&#8217;an has already had verses deleted from it but since it became mass transmitted today then no further deletions shall take place. He also rejects additions generally. Then he gives a different interpretation to the popular verse above and claims it means &#8220;We know it&#8221; instead of &#8220;We shall preserve it&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He writes on pg.327:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وفيه أنه لم يخرج بذلك عن كونه معجزا لبقاء الأسلوب والبلاغة اللذين هما مناط الاعجاز بحالهما بل سائر وجوه الاعجاز أيضا مع أنه لم يدخل الاخبار على حصول الزيادة وادعى على عدمها أيضا الاجماع الشيخ والطبرسي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Furthermore, it (meaning the Qur&#8217;an in our hands) continues to be a miraculous text due to the fact that both its style and eloquence remained present, they are the center of miraculous texts and even other miraculous factors (remained therein). Although the narrations have not declared that any additions took place and consensus was claimed on this by al-Shaykh and al-Tubrusi]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: He is saying that even after the book was corrupted yet it can still be considered a miraculous text since the corruption did not alter the style and eloquence. He believes that addition has not taken place and that only addition can affect the miraculous nature of the text not the deletion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">والذي له مدخلية في الاخراج عن حد الاعجاز هو الزيادة غالبا وكذلك لم يظهر وقوع التحريف في آيات الاحكام مع أنه لو وقع فليس بأعظم من غيبة الإمام عليه السلام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What can play a major role in ruining the miraculous nature (of the text) are usually the additions. In addition, it doesn&#8217;t appear that corruption has reached the verses of religious rulings although even if it did then it is no greater than the absence of our Imam (as)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: The author affirmed what we said above that deletions do not harm the beauty of the text. Then he says that the corruption didn&#8217;t seem to affect any of the verses containing religious laws therefore they are still present. He adds, that even if the verses of the laws were in fact corrupted, then it&#8217;s a lot less worse than the Imam who is hiding. So there&#8217;s nothing that guarantees the safety of such verses from corruption since the loss of the Imam is more important for them than the loss of some verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next the author discusses the prophetic order to refer to the book of Allah and hold fast to its rulings in the light of the above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says on page 328:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ما ورد من هذه الأخبار عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم لا ينافي ما ذكرنا فإنه أمر أيضا بالتمسك بالأوصياء عليهم السلام مع أنهم صاروا ممنوعين عن التبليغ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What was reported from those narrations from the Prophet (saw) does not conflict with what we previously mentioned (That the Qur&#8217;an has been corrupted) for he has also ordered us to hold on to the legatees (as) although they are currently prevented from preaching]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: As is clear, the author says that the narrations of the Prophet (saw) do not oppose the belief in Tahreef. The Prophet (saw) ordered us to obey the 12 Imams according to the author but they&#8217;re not available. Similarly, the verses that were deleted by some evil men according to his sect are also unavailable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأما ما ورد من الأئمة عليهم السلام فلا ينافي تجويزهم العمل بها من باب التقية وحكم الله الظاهري</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for what was reported from the Imams (as) with this regard, then it also doesn&#8217;t conflict as they permitted it out of Taqiyyah and following Allah&#8217;s apparent laws]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: He means that those narrations where the Imams ordered their followers to read the same Qur&#8217;an we&#8217;re reading and present the narrations to Allah&#8217;s book. He says this was only out of Taqiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">كما سنقول في القراءات السبعة المتواترة ما يقرب من ذلك أو نقول إنا لا نلتزم تغيير الاحكام فيما ذكر في الكتاب الذي بأيدينا اليوم بل هي صحيحة وإن كان لا ينافي ذلك حذف بعض الكلمات منه كذكر أسماء أهل البيت عليهم السلام والمنافقين وعدم ذكر بعض الأحكام أيضا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We will say something similar regarding the seven Mutawatir recitations. We say that we do not hold the opinion that the rulings were changed in the Book we hold in our hands today rather they&#8217;re correct although this does not conflict with believing that some words were deleted such as the names of Ahlul-Bayt (as) or the hypocrites or even some rulings too]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: He says that holding on to the seven recitations is also out of Taqiyyah and repeats that he doesn&#8217;t believe the rulings found in the present Qur&#8217;an have been corrupted although other types of corruption crept into our Book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author then mentions that the above can be opposed by the claim that the seven recitations were mass transmitted and some of their scholars claimed consensus on this and some even went further to include the other three recitations. He then moves on to mention another group of their scholars who objected to this and disbelieved in the mass transmission of the seven recitations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He says on page 330, that those who claim Tawatur for these recitations imply that they&#8217;re mass transmitted directly from Allah through the Prophet (saw). He says this is incorrect based on what he wrote in the previous section about how all the Books were burned by `Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">نعم إن كان مرادهم تواترها من الأئمة عليهم السلام بمعنى تجويزهم قرائتها والعمل على مقتضاها فهذا هو الذي يمكن أن يدعى معلوميتها من الشارع لأمرهم بقرائة القرآن كما يقرء الناس وتقريرهم لأصحابهم على ذلك وهذا لا ينافي عدم علمية صدورها عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ووقوع الزيادة والنقصان فيه والاذعان بذلك والسكوت عما سواه أوفق بطريقة الاحتياط</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Whereas if they meant that it is mass transmitted from the Imams (as) that they permitted their followers to recite the Book and work with its rulings then this is a legitimate claim since they ordered that the Qur&#8217;an be recited the way the people recited it and they accepted this. This doesn&#8217;t conflict with it having came from the Prophet (saw) but then having been exposed to additions and deletions however remaining silent in this regard was better out of precaution.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On page 333 he quotes after a long discussion of what was meant by the &#8220;seven letters&#8221; in the popular narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وكيف كان فدعوى تواتر السبعة عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله محل كلام &#8230; نعم اتفق التواتر في الطبقات اللاحقة وأيضا تواترها عنهم كيف يفيدوهم من آحاد المخالفين استبدوا بآرائهم كما تقدم وإسنادهم إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآله إن ثبت فلا حجة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Either way, the mass transmission of the seven recitation directly from the Prophet (saw) is disputed [etc] Yes, Tawatur did occur in later stages but how can this be useful for them (meaning the Shia) if it came through individuals from among our opponents who had complete control over this matter and their chains to the Prophet (saw) even if they were able to establish them then they are still not binding upon us]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s the end of his chapter regarding the Book of Allah and from this we conclude the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- He casts doubt on the seven recitations preserved by the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- He casts great doubt on the Book compiled by `Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- He refutes any arguments in support of the safety of the Qur&#8217;an from corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">D- He does not view that the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an is a great matter since the occultation of his Imam is a greater calamity in his opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">E- He doesn&#8217;t think additions took place as it would affect the miraculous nature of the text but is ultimately unsure of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">F- He believes deletions and omissions took place and doesn&#8217;t seem to object to this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">G- He believes the verses containing rulings in the Qur&#8217;an are intact and correct even though some rulings may have been deleted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">H- He believes the Imams ordered the Shia to recite the Qur&#8217;an in our hands today and to present the narrations to Allah&#8217;s book but only out of Taqiyyah.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The belief in Tahreef is something the Shia scholars inherit. The same way Jaza&#8217;iri inherited it from Majlisi, or Kulayni inherited it from `Ali bin Ibrahim, today we will see how al-Qadi Sa`id al-Qummi inherited it from his teacher al-Fayd al-Kashani.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Qadi  Sa`id Muhammad bin Muhammad Mufid al-Qummi (d.1107 AH) was favored by the Safavid kings of Persia especially Shah `Abbas and he wrote many books one of which is &#8220;Al-Arba`iniyat li Kashf Anwar-ul-Qudsiyat&#8221; and it is the book we will be quoting from today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On pages 65-66 of this book, the author writes about why all Qur&#8217;anic recitations are binding but decides to boast about `Ali&#8217;s personal recitation and the superior Qur&#8217;an possessed by their 12 Imams as opposed to ours and here is the calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">كما أن القرآن الذي عند أئمتنا عليهم السلام هو بعينه المسموع من النبي صلى الله عليه واله بسماع علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام حين سماع غير علي عليه السلام هذا القرآن. وأين سماع مولانا -مولى الأنام- من سماع الرعايا !! مثلا : حين ما سمع ابن مسعود او غيره من النبي هذه الآية (إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ مُنْذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ). وسمع علي (عليه السلام) هكذا: (إِنَما أنت منذر لعباد وعلي لكل قوم هاد). فـــــي الحالة التي سمع القوم بدون لفظة: ((علي)) وذلك للاتساع الالهي والوحدة الجامعة للكلم الرباني وهكذا الحكم في اختلاف القراءات السبع حيث يسمع كل قوم من النبي او الوصي مايوافق لغتهم ومحاورتهم في سماع واحد ومكان واحد. فأحتفظ بذلك التحقيق فإنه من مشرب الرحيق والحمد لله على فضله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Just like the Qur&#8217;an stored with our Imams (as) is the same one heard from the Prophet (saw) but through the hearing of `Ali ibn abi Talib (as) not the hearing of others. And how can one compare the hearing of our master -meaning `Ali- (as) to that of the other subjects!? For example: When Ibn Mas`oud or others heard this verse from the Prophet (saw): {You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.} [13:7] `Ali (as) heard it like this: &#8220;You are only a warner to servants and `Ali to all people is a guide.&#8221; So the folks heard it without the word &#8220;`Ali&#8221;. That is because of the godly vastness and the unity binding the Lord&#8217;s speech, such is the ruling concerning the differences between the seven recitations as each person hears from the Prophet (saw) or his legatee (Wasi) what suites their languages and dialects in the exact same hearing and place.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to this genius, the Prophet (saw) taught `Ali one Qur&#8217;an and taught the rest of us another. Maybe that&#8217;s the author&#8217;s solution to all the narrations claiming corruption of the Qur&#8217;an in Shia books, he thinks that `Ali being the great man that he is magically hears the same verse in a different way, a more superior way as the author is clearly hinting, thus the hidden Qur&#8217;an that the 12th man is hiding is much better than ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because that hidden man&#8217;s book contains this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You are only a warner to servants and `Ali to all people is a guide.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of this verse found in our Qur&#8217;an today:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.} [13:7]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we will be covering the early Shia book of Tafseer known as &#8220;Tafseer Furat&#8221; written by one of their scholars who lived in the time of the minor occultation. His name is Furat bin Ibrahim al-Kufi and his book is one of the earliest Imami books of Tafseer that were preserved to this day thus making it a valuable asset.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researcher of the book quotes al-Majlisi&#8217;s opinion regarding the narrations of the book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">كون أخباره موافقه لما وصل إلينا من الأحاديث المعتبرة وحسن الضبط في نقلها مما يعطي الوثوق لمؤلفه وحسن الظن به</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The fact that its narrations are in harmony/agreement with what has reached us from the accepted narrations, and the accuracy of its transmission grants reliability to its author and makes us think well of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So let&#8217;s take a look at a few samples from this book and see what al-Majlisi considers as being in agreement with the vast bulk of Shia narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Colored parts are Shia attempts to corrupt the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.60</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن أبي جعفر الباقر عليه السلام:وقال: نزل جبرئيل عليه السلام بهذه الآية هكذا: [وقوله. ر] بئس ما اشتروا&#8230;بغيا في علي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From abu Ja`far al-Baqir (as), he said: Jibril (as) descended with the following verse as such: {How abject is the price for which they exchange their lives that they should disbelieve in what Allah has sent down, out of jealousy <span style="color: #ff0000;">from `Ali</span> that Allah should reveal of His grace to whomever He wills of His bondmen!}]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.105</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فرات قال: حدثنا أبو عبد الله جعفر بن عبد الله قال: حدثنا محمد بن عمر قال: حدثنا جابر! قال أبو جعفر عليه السلام: نزل جبرئيل عليه السلام على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم بهذه الآية هكذا: يا أيها الذين أوتوا الكتاب آمنوا بما نزلنا في علي مصدقا لما معكم من قبل</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu Ja`far (as) said: Jibril (as) descended on Muhammad (saw) with this verse like such: {O People given the Books! Believe in what We have sent down <span style="color: #ff0000;">regarding `Ali</span> confirming the Book which you possess}]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.146</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فرات قال: حدثني جعفر بن محمد الفزاري معنعنا: عن أبي جعفر عليه السلام قال: لو أن الجهال من هذه الأمة يعلمون متى سمي على أمير المؤمنين [لم ينكروا ولايته وطاعته. قال: فسألته: ومتى سمي علي أمير المؤمنين.ب، ر]؟ قال: حيث أخذ الله ميثاق ذرية آدم وكذا [ب: هكذا] نزل [به. ب] جبرئيل على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم [وبارك. أ]: وإذ أخذ ربك من بني آدم من ظهورهم ذريتهم وأشهد هم على أنفسهم ألست بربكم وأن محمدا عبدي ورسولي وان عليا أمير المؤمنين قالوا: بلى. ثم قال أبو جعفر [عليه السلام. ب]: والله لقد سماه الله باسم ما سمى باسمه [ب: به] أحدا قبله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu Ja`far (as) said: &#8220;If the ignorant from this nation knew when `Ali was named chief of believers, they would not have rejected his love and obedience.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;When was `Ali called chief of believers?&#8221; He (as) replied: &#8220;When Allah made the progeny of Adam testify and this is how Jibril revealed it to Muhammad (saw): {And remember when your Lord brought forth the generations from the backs of the Descendants of Adam, and made them their own witness; “Am I not your Lord, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and Muhammad is my slave and messenger and `Ali is the chief of believers?</span>”; they all said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;} He (as) then said: &#8220;And Allah has bestowed upon him a name that nobody before him held.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.231</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فرات قال: حدثني علي بن يزداد القمي معنعنا: عن حسان العامري قال: سألت أبا جعفر عليه السلام عن قول الله: ولقد آتيناك سبعا من المثاني والقرآن العظيم قال: ليس هكذا تنزيلها إنما هي: ولقد آتيناك سبعا من المثاني نحن هم ولد الولد والقرآن العظيم علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I asked abu Ja`far (as) about Allah&#8217;s words: {And indeed We have given you seven verses that are repeated, and the great Qur’an} He (as) replied: &#8220;This isn&#8217;t how it was revealed, it is as such: {And indeed We have given you seven that are repeated, <span style="color: #ff0000;">we are they, the son of the son</span>, and the great Qur’an <span style="color: #ff0000;">`Ali ibn abi Talib peace be upon him</span>.}]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.234</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">فرات قال: حدثنا محمد بن القاسم [بن عبيد. أ، ب. قال: حدثنا الحسن بن جعفر قال: حدثنا أبو موسى المشرقاني قال: حدثنا عبد الله بن عبيد عن علي بن سعيد. ش]: عن أبي حمزة الثمالي [عن جعفر الصادق عليه السلام. أ، ر] قال: قرأ جبرئيل [عليه السلام. ب، ر] على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم [هذه الآية. أ، ش، ر] هكذا: وإذا قيل لهم ماذا أنزل ربكم في علي قالوا: أساطير الأولين).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ja`far al-Sadiq (as) said: Jibril (as) recited to Muhammad (saw) this verse in this way: {And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord sent down <span style="color: #ff0000;">regarding `Ali</span>?”, they say, “The tales of former people.”}]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There you have it brothers and sisters and these samples are sufficient since the book is loaded with nonsense. May Allah guide the foolish ones.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Twelver Shia don&#8217;t really have much to offer when it comes to Qur&#8217;anic sciences whether Tafseer, I`raab, Lughaat, Naskh, Qira&#8217;at etc&#8230; Those who read about the early Twelver Shia authors will see that they never paid much attention to the Qur&#8217;an, even if one were to find books that are related to the Qur&#8217;an among their writings, the main topic would be how many verses were revealed concerning the virtues of Ahlul-Bayt or condemning their enemies. From the earliest Shia books of Qur&#8217;anic sciences we have Tafseer al-Qummi, a book written by `Ali bin Ibrahim (d.329AH) the book of course was filled with narrations of Tahreef to the extent that today&#8217;s Twelvers are so embarrassed by it that they act as if they reject it. Another early Twelver book is Tafseer Furat al-Koufi written by abu al-Qasim Furat bin Ibrahim al-Koufi (d.352AH) also a book filled with Tahreef that they claim to disown when it suites them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another rare early book we came across written by a Twelver about the Qur&#8217;anic sciences was called &#8220;Kitab-ul-Qira&#8217;at&#8221; or &#8220;Al-Tanzil wal-Tahreef&#8221; by abi `Abdillah Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Sayyari (d.267AH). A very early book which makes it very valuable, of course when we opened the book and looked inside, it was no surprise, this extremist Shia scholar filled its pages with narrations of Tahreef.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Sayyari was one of the top Twelver Shia narrators in the time of al-`Askari, in fact `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi himself narrates from him in his book 2/409:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">علي بن إبراهيم القمي : حدثنا محمد بن جعفر قال حدثنا محمد بن أحمد عن أحمد بن محمد السياري عن فلان عن أبي الحسن  قال :  إن الله جعل قلوب الأئمة موردا لإرادته فإذا شاء الله شيئا شاؤه وهو قوله وما تشاؤن إلا يشاء الله رب العالمين</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also known that a group of Shia scholars have authenticated anybody whose name was mentioned in the chains of al-Qummi&#8217;s Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Sayyari however is considered a weak narrator and an extremist by al-Tusi, al-Najashi and Ibn al-Ghada&#8217;iri. Other Shia scholars of Hadith did not agree, they believed the man was unjustly branded as weak due to the nature of his reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia Muhaddith and the author of one of the eight main Shia Hadith books, al-Noori al-Tabrasi says about the man and his book: &#8220;In general, we can say that after the grand scholars narrated from him, such as: Al-Himyari, al-Saffar, abi `Ali al-Ash`ari, Musa bin al-Hasan al-Ash`ari and al-Hussayn bin Muhammad bin `Amir who are from the top reliable scholars, as well as the reliance of Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni on him (in al-Kafi). I add, also based on the fact that his book is devoid of any extremism or confusion and the reliance of the top scholars on him, then we should ignore what was said about him and shouldn&#8217;t doubt his book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Conclusion of Al-Mustadrak 1/114, second benefit #23.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni even considered him from his companions, he referred to him in al-Kafi vol.1 &#8220;Bab-ul-Fay'&#8221; #5:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">علي بن محمد بن عبد الله ، عن بعض أصحابنا أظنه السياري</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Muhammad bin `Abdullah, from some of our companions, as I recall al-Sayyari&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is also no surprise, since al-Kulayni did believe in Tahreef like al-Qummi and al-Sayyari, he has an entire chapter in his book about this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah, one of the eight main Shia books of Hadith, the popular leader of the Shia, al-Hurr al-`Amili himself considered al-Sayyari&#8217;s books from the accepted reliable sources. He said: &#8220;As for the relied upon books which we have copied from through an intermediary since we did not possess them. However, al-Saduq, al-Shaykh, al-Muhaqqiq, Ibn Idris, al-Shahid, al-`Allamah, Ibn Tawous, `Ali bin `Isa and others from the authors of the previous books have copied from them and here we list a group of these books which they have declared quoting from: (&#8230;etc&#8230;) The book of abi `Abdillah al-Sayyari.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah 30/160-161.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without further ado, let&#8217;s browse this early Shia Tafseer book and provide some samples of what it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The copy relied upon is the 2009 edition, researched and presented by Ethan Kohlberg and Muhammad `Ali Ameer Mu`azzi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.9: [Hammad bin `Isa, from Ibrahim bin `Umar, he said: abu `Abdillah (as) said: &#8220;The Qur&#8217;an contains the news of the past, the present events and what is to come; it (also) contained the names of men but they were removed.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.9: [`Ali bin al-Nu`man from `Abdullah bin Muskan (&#8230;) from abi Ja`far (as), he said: &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for the additions and subtractions that have taken place in the Qur&#8217;an, our right would not have been hidden from one with intellect. When our Qa&#8217;im rises his speech will be affirmed by the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.9: [`Ali bin al-Hakam, from Hisham bin Salim, he said: aba `Abdillah (as) said: &#8220;The Qur&#8217;an brought forth by Jibreel (as) to Muhammad (saw) was seventeen-thousand verses.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.9: [Ibn Faddal, from Dawoud bin abi Yazid, from abi `Abdillah (as): &#8220;The Qur&#8217;an was revealed with the names of seven, Quraysh erased six and left aba Lahab.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice dear reader we&#8217;re still at the very beginning yet we have proved our point clearly, if the book begins with such narrations then Allah help us all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.20 [Ibn Sinan, from `Ammar, from al-Munakhkhil, from Jabir, from abu Ja`far (as), he said: &#8220;Jibreel (as) came down with this verse like this: How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what was revealed concerning `Ali.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the verse in the Qur&#8217;an says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed} [2:90]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.20: [Al-Husayn bin Sayf, from his brother, from his father, from Zayd al-Shahham, from abi Ja`far (as), he said: &#8220;Jibreel descended with the following verse as such: But those who wronged changed the right of Muhammad&#8217;s family, to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged the family of Muhammad a punishment.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the verse in the Qur&#8217;an says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment} [2:59]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay now let&#8217;s take some samples from the last pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.181: [Muhammad bin Awramah, from al-Rabi` bin Zakariya, from a man, from Yunus bin Dhabiyan, he said: abu `Abdillah (as) recited: &#8220;By the night when it covers &#8211; And [by] the day when it appears &#8211; ِGod created the male and female, and to `Ali belongs the hereafter and the first life.&#8221; He said: &#8220;This is how it was revealed.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the verses are like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{By the night when it covers (1) And [by] the day when it appears (2) And [by] He who created the male and female, (3) Indeed, your efforts are diverse.} [92:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">pg.165: [Al-Barqi, from Muhammad bin Sulayman, from his father, from abi Basir, from abi `Abdillah (as) about Allah&#8217;s words: &#8220;A supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen &#8211; To those who disbelieve in loving `Ali ; of it there is no preventer.&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;By Allah this is how Jibreel (as) revealed it to Muhammad (saw) and that&#8217;s how it is recorded in Fatimah&#8217;s (as) Mushaf.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course verse [70:2] does not contain the part &#8220;in loving `Ali&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the book contains plenty of other narrations of corruption but what we have presented from the first pages is sufficient and there is no need for more to prove that this guy believed in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an just like the majority of early Imami Shia.</p>
