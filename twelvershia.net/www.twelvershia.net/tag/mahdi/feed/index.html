<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we will give a simple summary of all the correct beliefs that have reached us authentically regarding Imam Mahdi based on the well-researched work of the scholar Dr. `Abdul-`Alim `Abdul-`Adhim al-Bistawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The topic of Imam Mahdi although not mentioned in God&#8217;s Book is a topic that the commoners love to speak of. Story-tellers found it really easy to narrate wonderful tales and weird stories in order to appeal to the masses. The stories were later attributed to God&#8217;s Messenger (saw), the noble Companions, the pious followers and even to the people of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this study, we will rely on the popular books of the scholars of Islam. We will dismiss all reports that do not contain a chain of transmission, such as those that begin with &#8220;It has been narrated that&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;We were told that&#8230;&#8221; because relying on hear-say has no place in a respectable academic study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will also ignore the books of the Shia sects who are obsessed with the &#8220;Awaited Imam Mahdi&#8221; or &#8220;12th Imam&#8221; as they call him. This is because they claim to have received special knowledge from certain descendants of `Ali bin abi Talib which they have collected in secret documents. This claim is very dubious and highly un-academic, what makes this more suspicious is the vast amount of self-contradicting stories and unbelievable tales contained in their printed books that cannot be found anywhere else nor does it have a basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of this book went through hundreds of narrations in the main books of the Muslims while looking into the authenticity and weakness for each and every report. The result as one can read in his book and as you can see below is that out of the hundreds of narrations, only a handful are authentic and they are very subtle without much detail. This shows that the majority of what&#8217;s spread among laypeople are fantasies and myths without much truth to them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">I- Meaning of &#8220;Mahdi&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Arabic word Mahdi comes from the root &#8220;Huda&#8221; which means guidance and thus al-Mahdi simply means &#8220;The guided one&#8221;. The belief in the Mahdi or the concept of a Mahdi is referred to as &#8220;al-Mahdawiyyah&#8221; and it is a technical scholarly term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The word was used in many narrations and reports, in an authentic report `Isa (as) is described as being &#8220;Imaman Mahdiyyan&#8221; or a &#8220;guided leader&#8221;. In another, the righteous Caliphs are described by the Messenger (saw) as &#8220;Rashidin Mahdiyyin&#8221; or &#8220;The rightly guided successors after me.&#8221; In some authentic narrations the Prophet (saw) supplicates God to make his Companion abi Salamah from the same status as &#8220;al-Mahdiyyin&#8221; or &#8220;The guided ones&#8221;. In other authentic report, he (saw) supplicates for his Companion Jarir bin `Abdullah that &#8220;O Lord make him steady and turn him to a guided guide&#8221; or &#8220;Hadiyan Mahdiyya&#8221; a very similar supplication was made for Mu`awiyah bin abi Sufiyan. In another authentic narration the Prophet (saw) made supplication for himself and the entire nation: &#8220;O Lord, bestow upon us the beauty of faith and make us all guided guides.&#8221; among many other locations in prophetic-narrations and poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sense, the prophetic prophesy is simply stating that at the end of times, there will emerge &#8220;al-Mahdi&#8221; or a &#8220;Guided leader.&#8221; This is not his name, rather it is his title and a description of his conduct and actions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">II- Different positions regarding Imam Mahdi in this nation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are four groups and we list them from majority to minority:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- Those who believe in the coming of a guided leader who precedes `Isa (as) and leads the nation before his advent.  He shall be born at the end of times and is called &#8220;Muhammad bin `Abdullah&#8221;. This group is the vast majority of Muslims and their evidence is a large amount of prophetic narrations a few of which are authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Those who believe the guided leader is already born and call him &#8220;Muhammad bin al-Hasan&#8221;, they attribute to him miraculous powers, divine knowledge and infallibility. They believe he has been walking among us for more than a thousand years in disguise so no one may recognize him. This group is the Twelver Shia sect who claims to possess secret knowledge from the prophetic-household.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- Those who believe that the guided leader at the end of times is none other than `Isa (as) himself. They weaken the narrations that state otherwise and rely on an authentic report declaring that `Isa (as) will be a guided (Mahdi) leader at the end of times. This is supported by some reports attributed to a few of the early followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">D- Those who disbelieve in the awaited guided leader and the second coming of `Isa (as) and view these as foreign beliefs that are harmful to Islam as it causes laziness and places false hopes in a mythical character that will never show up. This view has not much support and is adopted by a small minority most of which are Qur&#8217;anists.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">III- The beliefs Muslims must hold concerning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A-Beliefs we learned through authentic explicit narrations that clearly speak of Imam Mahdi:</h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>He is from the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) household, from Fatimah&#8217;s progeny.</li>
<li>His name will be Muhammad bin `Abdillah.</li>
<li>He has a high forehead and a distinctively thin and slightly curved nose.</li>
<li>God will prepare and rectify him in one night.</li>
<li>A person will be killed if he even mentions the name of God before his time.</li>
<li>He will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression.</li>
<li>When three leaders fight for a treasure his army will appear from the east.</li>
<li>He shall come from the direction of Khurasan with black flags.</li>
<li>Many Arabs will be killed in these wars unlike ever before.</li>
<li>He shall appear at the end of times.</li>
<li>He will be blessed with rain so the earth will bear fruits and cattle will increase.</li>
<li>He shall distribute money generously and fairly.</li>
<li>The number of his supporters at the beginning will be around 306 like in Badr.</li>
<li>His supporters will be from the most pious of people.</li>
<li>He shall first emerge in the city of Makkah after a pure soul is killed.</li>
<li>People will celebrate around him when he emerges.</li>
<li>He shall reward the righteous and forgive the wrong-doers.</li>
<li>He will be strict on his governors.</li>
<li>He will be fifty one or fifty two at the time he reaches authority.</li>
<li>He shall lead the nation for seven years until `Isa (as) descends.</li>
<li>`Isa (as) refuses to lead the nation in prayer to honor them.</li>
<li>`Isa (as) defeats the Dajjal and remains among them for forty years.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">B-Beliefs we learned through authentic but vague reports that seem to be referring to Imam Mahdi:</h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>There will be a sign in sunrise.</li>
<li>He may receive the pledge between al-Rukn wal-Maqam.</li>
<li>He may be one of the twelve Caliphs that succeed the Prophet (saw).</li>
<li>He may be the one to seek refuge in the Ka`bah while his opponents will be swallowed by the earth.</li>
<li>A Syrian army that opposes him will be weakened by severe weather.</li>
<li>He fights a Syrian army with an army of his own composed of three groups.</li>
<li>His army&#8217;s slogan will be &#8220;death, death&#8221; and they number between twelve and fifteen thousand.</li>
<li>When God honors him with guidance, he will still be young.</li>
<li>He shall easily become a leader.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>NOTE: If you read anything other than the above concerning &#8220;Imam Mahdi&#8221;, know that it is taken from unreliable weak reports or fabricated stories. Only the above details are what we know through the popular authentic narrations.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">IV- Reliable prophetic-narrations explicitly mentioning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- `Ali narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is from my household, God will rectify him in one night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- `Abdullah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;When you see the black flags emerging from the land of Khurasan, go and seek them for among them is God&#8217;s successor, the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;Towards the end of my nation shall emerge the guided one. God will bless him with rain so that the earth will bring forth its fruits; he will divide money justly and cattle will increase. He shall live around seven or eight years.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is of my lineage. He has a high forehead and a distinctively thin and slightly curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with tyranny and oppression, and he will rule for seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;In my nation shall be a guided man. No matter how long he lives he shall spend seven, eight or nine years filling the earth with justice and equity. The earth will bring forth its plants and the sky will send down its rain.&#8221; In some narrations we read an addition: &#8220;At that time, my nation will live a life unlike anything before it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Jabir narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;`Isa bin Mariyam (as) will descend so their guided leader will say: &#8216;Come lead us in prayer!&#8217; However, `Isa (as) replies: &#8216;No, this nation will be led (in prayer) by one of their own. This is how God honors them.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This shows how `Isa (as) declines the offer of our guided leader to be the leader of prayer and informs them that only people from Muhammad&#8217;s (saw) nation may lead each other.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Thawban narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;Near this treasure of yours, three will engage one another in combat. Each of them the son of a successor (leader). But it will not reach any of them. Then the black flags will come from the East, and they will kill you in a way unlike any nation before.&#8221; And he (saw) mentioned something I couldn&#8217;t memorize, then said: &#8220;If you ever hear of him then seek him, even if you have to crawl on snow, for verily he is God&#8217;s successor, the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Umm Salamah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is from my progeny; from Fatimah&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">V- Reliable reports from the Companions and Followers explicitly mentioning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Ibn al-Hanafiyyah narrates: We were with `Ali when a man asked him about the guided one. So, `Ali replied while signaling with seven fingers: &#8220;This is way far! That one will come out at the End of Time. (At that time) if a man said, &#8216;Allah! Allah!&#8217; he will be killed. Then, God the Most High will gather together a group around him, just as the separate pieces of cloud are joined together. God will unite their hearts. They do not need anyone nor will they rejoice if one joins them. Their number matches that of the people at Badr. The past Generations will not surpass them and the latter generations will not reach up to them. Their number will also be that of the companions of Talut who crossed the river with him.&#8221; Ibn al-Hanafiyyah asked Abu al-Tufay (the narrator): &#8220;Do you seek him?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: &#8220;He emerges from between these two mountains (meaning Makkah).&#8221; Abu al-Tufayl replied: &#8220;I shall not leave it (Makkah) till I die.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The beginning of the report portrays the state of corruption the world has reached, that even saying God&#8217;s name can get you killed. Then it describes the followers of the guided leader, they shall be around three hundred men just like the army of Badr. The last part discusses where this leader originates from.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Sa`id bin Jubayr narrates: Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;Three men come from our household: The blood shedder (al-Saffah), the triumphant (al-Mansur) and the guided (al-Mahdi).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Ibn `Abbas is talking about the children of Hashim but this narration can also be understood that Imam Mahdi is from al-`Abbas&#8217;s progeny. This is most likely why one of the `Abbasid Caliphs adopted the title &#8220;Mahdi&#8221; to boost his claim to the throne.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Mujahid narrates: A man from the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) Companions said: &#8220;The guided one shall not emerge before the pure soul (Nafs-ul-Zakiyyah) is killed. When the pure soul is killed, they shall incur the wrath of he who is in the sky and in the earth shall. The guided shall emerge and they (believers) will celebrate around him just like a bride&#8217;s family celebrates on her wedding night; he will fill the earth with justice and equity; earth will bring forth its plants; the sky will send down its rain and my nation will be blessed during his reign like never before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The pure soul is also the title of a revolutionary from al-Hasan bin `Ali&#8217;s progeny. Be warned however, many political leaders and personalities intentionally adopt titles like these to enforce their political position and claim that they are prophesied.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Salim bin abi al-Ja`d narrates: `Abdullah bin `Amr said: &#8220;O people of Kufah, you will be the happiest with regards to the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Most likely because he is from Hashim&#8217;s progeny and Kufah was politically aligned with Hashemites so `Abdullah assumed they&#8217;d be the happiest when Imam Mahdi appears.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Hisham narrates: Muhammad bin Sirin said: &#8220;The guided one is from this nation and he is the one to lead `Isa bin Mariyam (i.e in prayer).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Ibn Tawus narrates: `Ali bin `Abdullah bin `Abbas said: &#8220;The guided one shall not emerge until the sun rises with a sign.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: A very vague report.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Ibrahim narrates: I asked Tawus: &#8220;Is `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz the guided one?&#8221; He responded: &#8220;`Umar was guided but he is not that guided one (from the end of times). When he comes, the good-doer will be rewarded and the evil-doer will be forgiven. He spends the money, is strict on the governors and merciful towards the poor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Qatadah narrates: I asked Sa`id bin al-Musayyib: &#8220;Is the guided one true?&#8221; He said: &#8220;He&#8217;s true.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;From whom?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Quraysh.&#8221; I said: &#8220;From which?&#8221; He said: &#8220;From Hashim&#8217;s children.&#8221; I said: &#8220;Which ones?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Children of `Abdul-Muttalib.&#8221; I asked further and he said: &#8220;From Fatimah&#8217;s progeny.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9- Ibn Shawdhab narrates: Matir said: We heard that the guided one will accomplish things greater even than `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz. A beggar comes and asks him so he says &#8220;Enter the treasury and take what you wish.&#8221; After doing so, as he exits, he sees all people are full and satisfied so he feels regret and proceeds to return the money but is told: &#8220;We give and never take.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10- `Imran narrates: al-Samit (or Shamit) said: &#8220;His name is that of a prophet; he will be fifty one or fifty two; he rules for seven or eight years.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VI- Reliable prophetic-narrations referring to Imam Mahdi vaguely</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- `Ali narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;If only a single day&#8217;s worth remains of time (on this earth), God will send a man from my household who will fill it with justice as it was filled with oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- `Abdullah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;If only one day remains of this world, God will stretch that day until a man from my progeny whose name matches mine and his father&#8217;s name matches my father&#8217;s name is sent to you (i.e Arabs).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This means his name is Muhammad bin `Abdullah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;How will you (i.e Arabs) be if `Isa bin Mariyam (as) descends while your leader is one of you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: We know from other authentic reports that the leader at the time will be Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said that if only one night remains of this world then a man from his household will assume authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;A man will receive a pledge of allegiance between the corner of the black-stone and the station of Ibrahim (as). None shall degrade the sanctity of the House (i.e Ka`bah) except its own people; when they do so then doom shall befall the Arabs. The Abyssinians (i.e Africans) will then come and destroy it permanently, extract its treasure and it shall never be rebuilt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This is most likely not discussing Imam Mahdi as it is known that in his time there will be peace and prosperity.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The hour shall not come to pass until the earth is filled with oppression and tyranny, then a man from my progeny shall rise and fill it with justice and equity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The man whom `Isa bin Mariyam (as) prays behind is from my progeny.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;From among the successors who will lead you is one who will distribute wealth generously without counting.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9- Jabir bin Samurah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The people&#8217;s affairs will continue to be conducted well as long as they&#8217;re ruled by twelve chiefs.&#8221; Then he spoke a word I did not understand so I asked my father and he said: &#8220;All of them, from Quraysh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: A lot of people associate this report with Imam Mahdi. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that this is referring to Imam Mahdi as can be reviewed in our article <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/12/hadith-of-twelve-caliphs/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10- Umm Salamah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;A man will seek refuge in the House (i.e Ka`bah) so they will send an expedition after him but when they reach a certain desert land, they shall be swallowed by the earth.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;O Prophet (saw), what about those who were forced to join?&#8221; He (saw) replied: &#8220;They will be swallowed but then each man is judged on his intentions.&#8221; The narrator said: &#8220;It is the desert of Madinah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The above text may or may not be referring to Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;God&#8217;s spirit, `Isa bin Mariyam (as) shall descend so recognize him when you see him. He is a man of medium height, with a radiant complexion leaning towards white; he will be between (or dressed in) two slightly yellowish garments; His head looks as if it is dripping water even though it is not wet. He will break the Cross, kill the swine and abolish Jizyah (tax on Christians and Jews); he shall call them towards Islam and the Dajjal will perish in his time so peace will befall the people of earth. Lions will be with camels, tigers with cows, wolves with sheep and even children will play with snakes unharmed. He will stay in the World for forty years. Then, he will die and the Muslims will perform the funeral prayer for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Imam Mahdi will rule them for seven years until `Isa (as) descends, then it seems authority will be transferred to `Isa (as) the prophet who rules for forty years and defeats Dajjal.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VII- Reliable reports from the Companions and Followers vaguely referring to Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Ibn Zurayr narrates: `Ali said: &#8220;There will be tribulations in which people will become as (few as) the gold in the minerals; so do not verbally abuse the people of al-Sham except their oppressors for among them are the substitutes (i.e Abdal). God will send down on them torment from the sky which will divide and weaken them to the extent that foxes could (easily) defeat them. At that point, God will send forth a man from the Messenger&#8217;s (saw) progeny alongside twelve thousand supporters at least or fifteen thousand at most. Their slogan will be &#8216;Death, death&#8217; and they shall be composed of three divisions. Facing them, will be seven divisions, each will be led by one who is desirous of authority yet they shall be defeated by the Hashemite and God will return for them peace and blessing until the appearance of the Dajjal.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The &#8220;Abdal&#8221; are extremely pious people that are prophesied to appear in al-Sham one after the other, as if each is substituting the other. This appears to be a battle against an army during the reign of Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Abu Ma`bad narrates: Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;Days and nights shall not pass until a young one from our household attains authority; he will not be overcome by tribulations.&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O `Abbas, your elders were unable to achieve this (high status) yet your youngsters attain it?&#8221; He said: &#8220;It is God&#8217;s affair and decision. Just as He began it with us He shall end it with us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- `Awf narrates: Ibn Sirin said: &#8220;In our nation will be a successor who is even superior to Abu Bakr and `Umar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This is the opinion of Muhammad bin Sirin and the scholars disagree with this odd opinion. Some give this statement the same interpretation as the narration which states that people will come after the Sahabah who are better since they believed without seeing the Prophet (saw).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Ibn Sirin narrates: Abi al-Jald said: &#8220;He acquires authority easily from inside his house.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VIII- Conclusion to research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The guided leader, Imam Mahdi, is truth and should not be denied due to the presence of a number of Sahih and Hasan narrations as well as plenty of weak ones that support the existence of this character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The amount of weak and fabricated reports is astonishing. It seems plenty of folks decided to create stories concerning this prophesied figure and attribute them to the Prophet (saw) and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- The belief in a guided leader that emerges at the end of times is simply a sign of the hour. No emphasis was given to this matter in Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah and thus it is not of much importance in the daily lives of Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For those of you unable to grasp the sarcasm in the title, it is the fact that Shia keep claiming that the birth of their 12th Imam is common knowledge and popular to the point where it is Mutawatir. At the same time they want you to believe that the 12th Imam&#8217;s birth is a secret that was concealed from everyone and the Imam al-`Askari made sure that nobody would find out that he had a son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, a brazen contradiction and we will elaborate below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When debating the Shia concerning their 12th Imam, they will tell you that his birth and existence are agreed upon between all Muslims. They will make it seem as if you are sinful for even doubting such a clear matter, as if you are doubting the existence of the Prophet (saw) himself. How can one deny a matter that is Mutawatir? The nation mass transmitted the story of the 12th Imam, the son of al-Hasan al-`Askari!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when you stop and think, you notice that historians never mentioned anything regarding the man, as if he never really existed. Although a few geneologists may list him as a son for al-`Askari yet these guys only do so based on the stories of the Shia who insist the man had a son. They weren&#8217;t eye witnesses nor do they have a chain for such a wild claim. So if this guy is nowhere to be mentioned in historical sources and he&#8217;s stories can only be found in the books of those who believe in him, why are we supposed to believe in him exactly?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you tell the Shia that we&#8217;ve no reason to believe in a guy whose birth is not agreed upon, a guy who was neglected by all historians. They will provide answers like the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The clear matters documented by the mainstream historians, are matters that are apparent in people&#8217;s lives. Whereas, the occultation (of the Imam) is a private and secret matter.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Min al-Shakk ila al-Shakk by Sayyid Idris Husayni p150</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doesn&#8217;t this just mean that he&#8217;s unheard of? How can you convinse us to believe in a man whose very existence was concealed and whose whole life remains a secret to this day!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If his life is a secret and he was concealed since childbirth then there shouldn&#8217;t even be any solid evidence for his existense, since if there were any proofs this would contradict the secrecy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this research, we will rely on the book of al-`Allamah al-Majlisi &#8220;Bihar-ul-Anwar&#8221;, Volumes 51 to 53, the Part of &#8220;Kitab Tarikh al-Hujjah&#8221; which is composed of many chapters related to the stories of their 12th Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will quote each text from the above book, referring to it by Page/Volume accompanied by the #Number of report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(2/51 #3)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this report, abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-`Aaskari invited his aunt Hakimah who is the daughter of Muhammad al-Jawad to break her fast with them in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Askari tells her that on that night his son will be born, she asked:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I said: &#8220;Who&#8217;s his mother?&#8221; He told me: &#8220;Narjis&#8221; I told him: &#8220;May Allah make me your sacrifice, by Allah there are no traces (of pregnancy) on her!&#8221; He replied: &#8220;It is as I tell you.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We Muslims believe that these stories are of course all fabricated. We only wish to uncover the circumstances and purposes of such fabrications by the leaders of the Shia at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to learn about the types of chains used by Twelvers to transmit the stories of the 12th Imam, refer to our article:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/08/23/issues-of-ghaybah-part-9/" rel="external nofollow">The low-quality of Shiite narrations about the Imam’s birth</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this report, we conclude that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The aunt of al-Hasan al-`Askari, who is a close member of the household, did not know that al-Hasan was expecting a son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: How then can we expect the general public to know this matter and believe in it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The aunt Hakimah herself only learned of it on the same night that this child was supposed to be born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: It is not unlikely that the household wouldn&#8217;t know of the pregnancy in the first two weeks. However, the suspicious matter is that close members of the household are said to not have known anything for the entire duration of the pregnancy up until the night of birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- The identity of the mother was unknown, especially since no signs of pregnancy were present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: The fabricators of such stories had to deal with the fact that al-Hasan al-`Askari never left a son behind. In this context it makes perfect sense for them to inform us that the mother was unknown and had no signs of pregnancy, simply because nobody was ever pregnant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This condition continued during the night with no signs of a baby being born until Hakimah herself became suspicious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Hakimah said: &#8220;Doubts entered my heart.&#8221; So abu Muhammad (as) cried from towards the sitting room saying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be hasty O aunt, the matter is near.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We notice that the fabricator knows that the Shia are in doubt over this fictional character, so he wishes to show them that even the closest of household members were also suspicious of this miraculous birth. This is an attempt to encourage them to push their doubts aside and believe in the validity of Imamite faith regardless of how unbelievable the events may seem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When both Hakimah and Narjis fell unconscious, suddenly the 12th Imam appears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I (suddenly) felt my master (as) (i.e 12th Imam), I uncovered the cloth and found him in prostration. I held him in my embrace and found that he was cleaned]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the beginning of the secrets of the after his birth. We were discussing the secrecy surrounding this character before his birth. Now we are seeing the secrecy surrounding him after his birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Habit in Arab societies is that the household would bring their own women or women from the neighborhood to act as midwives. These women would help in delivering the baby, cleaning him and then taking care of the mother after birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice here, there was no need to bring such women. The baby suddenly appeared without warning, he was already clean and ready according to several reports. In other words, the fabricators made sure to paint a picture of absolute secrecy without any witnesses present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(Al-`Askari said): &#8220;O Aunt, on the seventh day return to us.&#8221; Hakimah said: I came back next morning to greet abu Muhammad (as). I uncovered the veil to check on my master (as) (i.e 12th Imam) but did not see him. I said: &#8220;May I be sacrificed for you, what happened to my master?&#8221; He (as) replied: &#8220;We bid him farwell just as Musa&#8217;s (as) mother bid her son farewell.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The baby doesn&#8217;t seem to be in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Seems here that the baby was so well hidden, that they sent him God knows where right on the very next day. This section could be very helpful in case some of al-`Askari&#8217;s students or companions entered the house and did not see any baby. They would complain: &#8220;But we entered the house on the last days  of al-`Askari&#8217;s life, still we didn&#8217;t spot a baby inside!?&#8221; The Shia leaders would argue: &#8220;Well, they sent him to a divine hidden location. That&#8217;s why you never saw a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narration continues with Hakimah returning on the seventh day to witness how al-`Askari fed his baby using only his tongue and she witnessed how the baby spoke and recited Qur&#8217;an. This is an attempt by the extremists to counter any sane man who would tell them: &#8220;How did he learn his knowledge if his father died while at the age of five?&#8221; The answer would be is that a kid who is born reciting Qur&#8217;an doesn&#8217;t even require to be taught. Report also shows the Imam offering his son a strange drink, yogurt or honey. This happens when the Imam inserts his tongue in the baby&#8217;s mouth and the tongue releases this nurishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the report, we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Musa said: I asked `Uqbah the servant about this so he answered: &#8220;Hakimah speaks the truth.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is Musa bin Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin Hamzah bin Musa bin Ja`far al-Sadiq.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above report that they wish for us to believe in, is by a bunch of unreliable Shia extremists. These unreliable Shia narrated it from Musa who is an unknown man, he in turn narrates it from Hakimah who is an unknown woman. The reader can check the early Shia Rijali books to see that these two individuals are completely unknown, how then can they expect the entire nation to submit to such shaky stories is beyond me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for `Uqbah the servant, God only knows who the heck this character is. For all we know he himself could be just as fictional as their 12th Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(5/51 #7)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the Shia report from other shady characters who are said to have witnessed this baby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Nasim the servant of abu Muhammad (as) told me, she said: The owner of this age told me, when I entered on him one night after his birth]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She says that the baby told her &#8220;God bless you&#8221; after she sneezed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Why should we believe this story? Who in the world is Nasim? She&#8217;s an unknown. The &#8220;owner of the age&#8221; is a title given to their 12th Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the narration before this one, #6 it states that there were two characters: Nasim and Mariyah. That report states that it was al-Qa&#8217;im who sneezed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the one after it, #8 it states that Nasim is a man not a woman. It seems even the gender is unknown. This one says he/she entered after ten nights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(5/51 #9)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu al-Hasan celebrates the birth by buying a gigantic amount of meat and bread and distributing it among Banu Hashim and others. Then he slaughtered several goats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: Where the heck is all the secrecy now? This Imam won&#8217;t make up his mind whether he wants the birth to be secret or a public celebration. This was reported by abu Ja`far al-`Amiri one of the sinners who claimed to be the emissary of the hidden Imam. You will see how this will conflict with everything else below it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(5/51 #10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu `Ali al-Khayzarani reports this one from a female servant he had gifted to al-`Askari. Who this servant is beyond me but it seems they keep relying on random servants to take news. As if these unknown folks couldn&#8217;t be easily bribed by some Shia leaders to say whatever they wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu `Ali al-Khayzarani, from a servant he had gifted to abu Muhammad (as): When Ja`far al-Kazzab broke into the house, she came back running from Ja`far. So he married abu `Ali and told him that she witnessed the birth of the master (as), that his mother&#8217;s name was Saqil and that aba Muhammad (as) told her what happened]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly, the name of the mother changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: This was supposed to be a secret birth mind you, yet this un-named female servant claimed to have witnessed everything, not only that, she says the Imam himself told her everything. Why the heck would he do that? How does he know she&#8217;s reliable? Isn&#8217;t she spilling this secret by telling her husband abu `Ali? What importance and value does she have that she was allowed to witness when the closest companions of the Imam were not allowed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now here&#8217;s the great part:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[She asked him (as) to supplicate to Allah, that He may bring about her death before him. Thus she died in the life of abu Muhammad (as)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: So strange how all these witnesses are unheard of, unknown or dead. How exactly are we going to verify this information if she&#8217;s dead? Reminds us of the book of &#8220;Sulaym bin Qays&#8221;, a man secretly gave it to another man on his deathbed, then the book emerged only after the second man was also dead leaving no way to verify its legitimacy. This seems to be the good old fashioned methodology of expert fabricators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I add, what sense does it make for the lady to wish for death? Such a random request!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration continues to say that a great light emanated from the baby, then white birds descended from the sky to take his blessings&#8230; Yet nobody noticed and the birth was a secret.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ja`far al-Kazzab is al-`Askari&#8217;s sibling, he had a dispute over his brother&#8217;s inheritance with one of al-`Askari&#8217;s female servants who claimed to be pregnant after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(5/51 #11)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin Ahmad al-`Alawi, from abu Ghanim the servant, he said: Abu Muhammad (as) recieved a son and called him Muhammad, he presented him to his companions on the third day and said: &#8220;This is your companion after me, my successor etc&#8230;&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh great, another servant!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: How many servants did this man have? Probably many since if you didn&#8217;t know these Imams were wealthy beyond your imagination. Of course, assuming these narrators didn&#8217;t lie and assuming that there was actually a man called abu Ghanim, we don&#8217;t know whether he was even a servant or not. It seems at this point, that Shia leaders would pay any fool and bring him to their followers and say: &#8220;Look, this man was a servant of the Imam, he saw the birth.&#8221; Out of the large amount of male and female servants, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d find quite a bunch of godless ones who are willing to make a few coins after their master&#8217;s death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Ghanim is unknown. Besides, wasn&#8217;t the birth supposed to be secret? What&#8217;s the point of all the secrecy of he&#8217;s going to invite all his friends and show them the Imam? You will also see how this conflicts with many reports under it that state that the Imam&#8217;s birth will be hidden from the Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(6/51 #12)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A long narration, the Imam abu al-Hasan sends his companion on a secret mission to buy him a female servant. The name changes here to Malikah a descendant of Sham`un. The woman embraces Islam and the Imam orders his sister Hakimah to teach her Islam and tells her:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Take her to your house, teach her the duties and traditions for she will be the wife of abu Muhammad (as) and the mother of al-Qa&#8217;im (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How is it then that in the previous narration Hakimah was shocked and surprised when al-`Askari told her that the girl is bearing a child? She should have already known since `Ali al-Hadi already told her. What&#8217;s funnier is that Hakimah keeps asking the Imam &#8220;Which of your women is pregnant?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(11/51 #14)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man called Muhammad bin `Abdullah al-Mutahhiri meets Hakimah after the death of abu Muhammad al-`Askari to ask her about the Imam&#8217;s birth and the state of confusion that engulfed the Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(Hakimah says): I had a female servant called Narjis, my nephew (as) visited me and started looking at her sharply. I said: &#8220;O master, maybe you liked her, shall I send her to you?&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice this insult towards their own Imam, that he&#8217;s staring at women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam tells her that he&#8217;s marveling at the fact that she will be the mother of the 12th Imam. This opposes previous reports that it was abu al-Hasan `Ali who bought her for his son, here it seems that she belonged to Hakimah. This contradicts the fact that Hakimah acted oblivious in the first report whereas here he tells her that Narjis will be the 12th Imam&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam one day tells Hakimah to stay and says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[O aunt, sleep with us tonight for on this night shall be born the kind child.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She asks as if completely oblivious, as if he never told her before:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From who will he be born O master? I saw no traces of pregnancy on Narjis]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When Fajr time comes, it will appear since she is like Musa&#8217;s mother, no pregnancy showed on her nor did anyone know about her until the time of birth]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Again, this reaffirms their previous stories that absolutely nobody knew about this pregnancy or child at least to the point before the birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask again, how can they blame the people for rejecting their beliefs? They believe in 12 leaders, yet when we search for the 12th one there&#8217;s no trace of him nor did anyone know of his birth. How are we expected to believe it? Makes no sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia leaders only wished to conform their beliefs to the popular narration of &#8220;Islam will remain strong up to twelve leaders; they&#8217;re from Quraysh&#8221;. If by any chance that narration mentioned 13 leaders instead of 12, the Shia would have said that Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-`Askari went into occultation, then they received a letter from him stating that he had a married a woman and received a newborn, the holy 13th Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Going back to topic&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hakimah says while Narjis was sleeping in front of her, suddenly the 12th Imam was born, he started reciting Qur&#8217;an in his mother&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hakimah says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then Narjis was hidden from me, as if a barrier was created between us [&#8230;] I returned and the barrier was lifted and she had a glow of light surrounding her. The child was in prostration while raising his index fingers towards the sky]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fantastic, again we have these hollywood visual effects to add to the drama of this movie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Hasan (as) carried him while the birds circulated on top of his head, he (as) cried to one of the birds: &#8220;Carry him, guard him well then return him to us every forty days.&#8221; The birds carried him and ascended to the sky.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam is flying with the birds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Remember, if any of al-`Askari&#8217;s students or companions entered his house to visit him they wouldn&#8217;t see the child. The Shia leaders will tell their doubtful followers: &#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention him out of Taqiyyah and you didn&#8217;t see him because the birds took him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah destroy them, how weak are their intellects and how pathetic are their excuses. All of this so they won&#8217;t say: &#8220;We&#8217;re wrong, `Ali was never an appointed leader.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who will breast feed him? Birds?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hakimah then asks about the birds, the Imam responds that they&#8217;re the angels who care for the Imams, raise them and teach them. So now you know dear reader, that they believe their Imams are like prophets who receive revelation from angels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[After forty days, the boy was returned so my nephew (as) invited me. I found a little boy moving and walking. I said: &#8220;Master, this is a two year old!?&#8221; He smiled and said: &#8220;Children of prophets, legatees, they mature differently. A boy from us grows in one month like others grow in a year etc&#8230;&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the purpose of them growing faster?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Purpose is that these frauds were trying to find excuses as to the young age of the Imam at the time when his father died. He was too young to lead, too young to learn knowledge and too young to know of how to escape and hide himself. This magical formula above solves their issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s the evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I kept seeing that boy every forty days until he became a man before abu Muhammad (as) passed]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two birds with one stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: The Shia leaders who fabricated this solved two issues, A- The fact that this boy was never seen nor was a baby seen in their house, since he was busy flying. B- How can a baby escape and go into occultation? Of course he had to be a man!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Hakimah said: aba Muhammad (as) passed a short-while after. The people differed as you see but by Allah I see him (i.e 12th Imam) day and night. He (as) would tell me about your questions so that I may answer you [&#8230;] I would receive a question and he (as) would send me the answers right away etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fifth emissary!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We assumed the emissaries of the hidden Imam were four, yet this new one seems to have came out of nowhere. If that&#8217;s the case then we must have had hundreds of narrations from Hakimah, everyone would be seeking her for answers since:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- There was great doubt over the four emissaries, even al-Kulayni, al-Himyari and al-Saffar barely narrated anything from them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Hakimah should have been more trustworthy since no one can doubt her, she&#8217;s from the household and she is in constant and direct contact with the hidden Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(15/51 #18)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man called Hamzah bin abi al-Fath told al-Hasan bin al-Mundhir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He gave me glad tidings, yesterday a boy was born to abu Muhammad (as) but he ordered to keep it secret. I asked what his name was, he (i.e Hamzah) told me: He&#8217;s called Muhammad]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam ordered to keep it secret but Hamzah is telling people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We don&#8217;t know who Hamzah heard this from since he wasn&#8217;t an eye witness of the birth. Who the heck is Hamzah anyway? Why would he tell people the 12th Imam&#8217;s name when the Imam strictly told them not to mention the boy&#8217;s name in many narrations?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(16/51 #19)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this report, al-Saduq who died in 381 hijri narrates from the emmissary of the Imam, Muhammad bin `Uthman al-`Amiri who died in 305 hijri. However, he narrates from him through six people!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Taliqani, from al-Hasan bin `Ali bin Zakariya, from Muhammad bin Khulaylan, from his father, from his grandfather, from Ghayyath bin Asad, that he heard Muhammad bin `Uthman al-`Amiri etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Has al-Saduq not heard of the elevated chains? There&#8217;s only 75 years difference between the two men yet Saduq places six narrators between them. In Sunni standards of Hadith, a man living in the era of Saduq can narrate from the Prophet (saw) himself via six narrators!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunni scholar al-Daraqutni who died in 385 which is later than al-Saduq would narrate from the Prophet (saw) himself through seven narrators!! With six narrators al-Daraqutni could easily reach a Companion of the Prophet (saw), not some man who died 75 years before him!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amiri said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When the successor, the Mahdi (i.e 12th Imam) was born, a ray shot up from the top of his head to the sky]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These nonsensical stories about glowing beams and light rays show the weakness in the minds of the fabricators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Imagine you&#8217;re living back in those days and at night time a light shoots up to the sky from a man&#8217;s house, yet he&#8217;s supposed to be a secret baby that nobody must know about. Alright, explain this bollywood special effect in the context of keeping the matter secret? Imagine our Prophet (saw) when escaping from the pagans in Makkah and hiding in the cave, a light shoots up to the sky! He&#8217;d be exposed in the blink of an eye, how counter-productive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next narration #20, has the same chain. It says the 12th Imam was born circumsized. He says he heard Hakimah say that no post-natal bleeding was observed on his mother after birth. He said, that&#8217;s the condition of all mothers of Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, more signs that the woman was never pregnant, these narrations are a testimony that none of the common folks or the mainstream Muslims saw any signs or any trace from any of the Imam&#8217;s women, no proof that they are pregnant or about to give birth. In other words, there&#8217;s no evidence al-`Askari had a son other than accepting these 1,000 year old narrations by a bunch of nobodies and considering them indisputable facts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: Everybody has the complete right to doubt these stories due to their weakness, their unreliability, their shakiness and their inconsistency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(16/51 #21)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrator tells us how his grandfather Ahmad bin Ishaq al-Qummi recieved a letter from al-`Askari after the 12th Imam was born, telling him of the birth and its secrecy:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The child is born, keep the matter concealed from all people. We did not disclose this to anyone excep to close relatives due to their closeness and our servants due to their nearness. We liked to inform you of this so that Allah may bring you joy just as he brought us joy.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to tell you so you can be happy!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(This contradicts the report by the &#8220;servant&#8221; who claimed al-Hasan himself shared this knowledge with his trusted companions)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Another narration showing the deep secrecy behind the birth. This report implies that nobody knew except near relatives and a few servants as well as this man from Qum. We ask, how can the Shia claim that the birth of their 12th Imam is mass-transmitted (Mutawatir) if the whole thing was a hidden secret that was concealed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dear readers is evidence that the so called mass-transmission (Tawatur) happened much later, and thus it isn&#8217;t binding on us. In order for the matter to be legitimately Mutawatir, then the birth needed to be public, popular and known by all people. Unfortuinately for them, we find that the matter is very weak, nowhere near being Mutawatir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, why did the Imam write a letter to inform this man specifically? What significance did he hold? He&#8217;s another unknown individual, we can&#8217;t even be certain that this letter is in the Imam&#8217;s handwriting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In narration #22, Saduq narrates from his teacher Ibn al-Walid, from an unknown man called `Abdullah bin al-`Abbas al-`Alawi, from another unknown man called Hasan bin al-Husayn al-`Alawi, that he entered upon al-`Askari and congratulated him on the birth of his son al-Qa&#8217;im.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(17/51 #25)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another narration about Hakimah, it says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I (i.e Hakimah) left right away until I reached abu Muhammad (as) while he sat in his house surrounded by his female servants. I asked: &#8220;May I be sacrificed for you O master, who is the mother of your successor?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Sawsan&#8221; I turned around and saw no other servant with signs of pregnancy except Sawsan]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time it&#8217;s Sawsan with signs of pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Different scenario, now the servant in question is Sawsan. I guess the main reason Shia differed on which female servant it is was due to the large amount of al-`Askari&#8217;s servants. Each liar carried this story but attributed it to a different servant since it seems they never agreed on that part. Additionally, Hakimah was able to spot signs of pregnancy on her as opposed to previous stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again she doubts her Imam:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The beginning of Fajr was upon us, so doubts entered my heart concerning the promise of abu Muhammad (as). He called me from his room: &#8220;Don&#8217;t doubt, a while and you will see it God-Willing.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in this one there is a procedure for child delivery:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I (i.e Hakimah) sat in the position of women who wish to help in delivery, she (i.e Sawsan) grabbed my shoulder, I pressed strongly and she moaned once then looked under her to find Allah&#8217;s beloved friend (i.e 12th Imam)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: What about the barriers and the glowing lights and the rays shooting to the sky? No need right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[After three days I missed Allah&#8217;s beloved friend. I headed to their house and entered the room that Sawsan was in. I saw no trace nor did I hear a noise. I hated to ask, so I entered on abu Muhammad (as) and was shy but he spoke up: &#8220;O aunt, he (i.e 12th Imam) is in Allah&#8217;s care and under Allah&#8217;s concealment until Allah permits. When I pass away and you see my followers (Shia) differ, then tell the reliable ones among them of this but tell them to keep it as a concealed secret [&#8230;] Allah will conceal him from his slaves so that nobody will see him until Jibril (as) offers him his horse]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this report we learn the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The baby was hidden as soon as he was born. Hakimah never heard a voice or saw a trace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Maybe he&#8217;s flying with the birds? If his own close relatives &#8220;never saw a trace or heard a noise&#8221; How is the matter Mutawatir as the liars claim? When did this Tawatur happen? The answer is it happened around a hundred years after al-`Askari&#8217;s death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The Imam doesn&#8217;t care about his Shia, his just tells her to inform the most reliable and trustworthy ones, who will be at most twenty to thirty people out of thousands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: This shows that absolutly nobody knew, the baby was born secretly. The followers had no clue nor did they see a trace or hear a voice. They thought al-`Askari died without successor, according to this she was supposed to tell the most reliable of them, but even if she did that means they couldn&#8217;t get to see him or verify his birth so their words hold no weight whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(This contradicts the report by the &#8220;servant&#8221; who claimed al-Hasan himself shared this knowledge with his trusted companions)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- These trustworthy people are supposed to keep the secret concealed and they&#8217;re supposed to not spread this news.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: This means every single Shia spreading this news today is a wicked sinner. They all disobeyed their Imam who clearly told them not to mention this. I guess those &#8220;reliable companions&#8221; weren&#8217;t that reliable after all. I add, How can there be Tawatur regarding his birth as the liars claim if only a small group of people knew about it and were instructed to keep it secret?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(19/51 #26)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hakimah story again with extra details and more emphasys on secrecy:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then he (as) handed him to it and said: I bid you farewell just as Musa&#8217;s mother did her son, be in Allah&#8217;s care and be near to Him. He said: &#8220;Return him to his mother O aunt and conceal the matter of this childbirth, do not tell anybody until Allah fulfills His decree etc&#8230;&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t tell anybody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: No reliable companions mentioned here, he just tells her to keep it an absolute secret and specifically asks her to not mention the matter to anybody. The boy is then sent away to a secret location, most likely the birds flew him up to the sky so he can be near Allah as his father said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fabricators knew some would seek Hakimah and try to verify, they knew Hakimah didn&#8217;t believe al-`Askari had a son. In order to avoid looking like liars, they claimed that they heard from her that the Imam asked her to keep it a secret, thus she&#8217;s not going to reveal that this baby was born no matter how many times you ask her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taqiyyah, a life saver!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(20/51 #27)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of their elders from Hakimah with the same story as before including the talking baby, he was cleaned and ready etc&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then a barrier was placed between me (i.e Hakimah) and abu Muhammad (as), like a veil, so I couldn&#8217;t see my master. I told abu Muhammad: &#8220;Where is my beloved friend?&#8221; He said: &#8220;He was taken by the One who has more claim to him than us.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again with the barriers and the child disappearing into nothingness!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hakimah returned after forty days, she found the baby talking and walking:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (as) smiled and said to me: O aunt, did you not know that we Imams grow in one day like others grown in one year?&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before it was one month like one year, now it&#8217;s one day like one year!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Imagine you hear your leader had a baby, you visit after 40 days and find a grown man, you ask &#8220;Who are you?&#8217; He replies: &#8220;I&#8217;m the baby.&#8221; That&#8217;s the situation above, may Allah save us from retadedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I returned later to check on him but couldn&#8217;t spot him, I told abu Muhammad (as): &#8220;What did our beloved friend do?&#8221; He said: &#8220;O aunt, we bid him farewell as Musa&#8217;s mother did.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In narration #28, a Nasibi man who was the neighbor of al-`Askari narrates from some old lady.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old woman says to the Nasibi neighbor:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I will tell you what I saw two years after you left our house.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We should believe nice old ladies, no?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apparently they&#8217;re narrating that this lady was invited to the house to help deliver the baby. They wrapped her head with a cloth and a servant took her inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The servant took me by the hand, wrapped my head with a cloth and took me out of the house back to my own. He handed me a bag of coins and told me: &#8220;Do not tell people what you saw.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: See the extent of secrecy surrounding his birth? They wouldn&#8217;t even trust an old weak lady. Then they tell you that the 12th Imam&#8217;s birth is common knowledge and is Mutawatir. Of course this lady did tell people it seems othertwise we wouldn&#8217;t have this report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, as per the narration this lady told them this story ages after al-`Askari died, nobody could verify her story nor was there a trace of this so called new born (man?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In narration #30, it says the master was born two years after his father died. Thus opposing all we read before it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(22/51 #31)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shalmaghani narrated from the servant of `Ali al-Hadi, from his father that he recieved an order to by meaty treats, they told him:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This is for our young beloved freind (as)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again with these servants, he says he recieved the order to buy treats, never claims to have witnessed the birth or seen the baby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In narration #32, a man called Ibrahim bin Idris (an unknown man) claims that al-`Askari sent him a sheep and ordered him to sacrifice it for the sake of the new born. However, he continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then I met him (i.e the Imam) after this so he told me: &#8220;The newborn has died.&#8221; Later, he sent me two sheeps and wrote: &#8220;In the name of Allah, these two sheep are for the sake of your beloved friend. Eat may Allah bless you and feed your brothers.&#8221; I met him a second time after it but he never said a word.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1 Sheep = No Mahdi, 2 Sheep = Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We all know these are lies because if al-`Askari had a son before this one and he openly sacrificed for him, the Shia would have made a big deal out of it and they would&#8217;ve denied the baby&#8217;s death and claimed it was hidden in Taqiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the narration itself, it makes no sense. The text is very vague, we don&#8217;t know what exactly is going on but we&#8217;re supposed to assume they&#8217;re slaughtering sheep to celebrate the 12th Imam&#8217;s birth? Then the Imam mentioned no words when the man met him in person. Well couldn&#8217;t that mean that someone was forging letters in the Imam&#8217;s name? The Imam never said a word since he had no clue? I add, it seems that this guy barely got in touch with the Imam, from this story we conclude that he only met him twice in person, how reliable is he and why would we believe him? Where&#8217;re those letters? What&#8217;s the evidence that any of these private meetings took place? Why would the Imam slaughter sheep and celebrate publicly then suddenly embrace Taqiyyah and act like nobody was born? Too many questions for such a small vague narration by this nobody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next couple of narrations are words of historians and authors, each claiming a different date of birth and a different name for the mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(26/51) Al-Majlisi reports from Hakimah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I observed her but couldn&#8217;t see a sign of pregnancy, I asked my master abu Muhammad (as): &#8220;I do not see a sign of pregnancy.&#8221; He smiled and said: &#8220;We the legatees are not carried in the wombs but we&#8217;re only carried in the thighs etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Too pure to be born the usual way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: In this way, no one could accuse the Shia leaders of lying as none of the man&#8217;s women were pregnant. They will reply right away: &#8220;No no, the Imams are born from the thighs, that&#8217;s why none of his women looked pregnant!&#8221; Then you tell them that nobody saw this baby, they reply: &#8220;He was hidden and kept concealed then the birds came and carried him right away. That&#8217;s why you never saw him!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good luck convinsing brainless folks with this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only that, they insist that he was born at the time of Fajr, when nobody could find out and the sky is shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this version we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[So I fell asleep, I couldn&#8217;t help it. Narjis also fell asleep and so I didn&#8217;t notice anything until I sensed my master al-Mahdi]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She could have been dreaming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: No mention of an old hag coming to help deliver or glowing lights or barriers or any bollywood visual effects, both women slept then woke up finding this miracle child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narration continues similarly to past stories, born clean, in prostration, Imam sticks his tongue in the baby&#8217;s mouth, he speaks eloquent words and she returns to find him after seven days reciting Qur&#8217;an and Torah and speaking in tongues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Imam says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When my Lord blessed me with the guided one, He sent two angels that carried him to the throne where he stood in front of Allah]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More extremist nonsense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course they narrated more random things, such as in (31/51 #2)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam said about the 12th one:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[You (i.e Shia) will not see him nor is it permitted for you to call him by his name]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: There&#8217;s a bunch of narrations like this one. In fact there&#8217;s a couple of narrations saying he&#8217;s dead and he shall emerge after death that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s called al-Qa&#8217;im (the one who rises).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In (32/51 #6) their Imam says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Qa&#8217;im is the one whose birth shall be concealed from the people, his person will be hidden from them and they are not allowed to mention his name]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s take a pause.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: This means no one witnessed his birth, no one saw the baby after birth and even the people who did believe there was a son didn&#8217;t know the name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another report #7:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I asked: &#8220;What about the name?&#8221; He (i.e the emissary) replied: &#8220;Do not dare to look into it! The people think that this lineage was cut.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not dare ask since you might find the truth! That we&#8217;re all frauds and liars!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: Here the story of the fabricators is explicit that the people didn&#8217;t see that the man had any children, thus the people in that city who were living at the time thought the lineage stopped because they never saw a descendant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After they attributed a lot of nonsense to their Imams, now came the easy part, they began attributing things to the hidden baby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Shia man called al-Salihi said in (33/51 #8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[After abu Muhammad (as) died, our companions asked us about the name and location (of their 12th one) so a letter came out saying: &#8220;If you speak the name they will spread it and if they know the location they will point to him.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very reliable letter!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: This is evidence that the Shia never knew this baby&#8217;s name, this raises more questions since they&#8217;ve narrated many reports that did include the name explicitly and narrated others in which the Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;His name is like my name.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to these numerous Shia narrations the name should be common knowledge by now. However, here we find the reality on the ground very different, the Shia themselves never seemed to know let alone the mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The emissary Muhammad bin `Uthman al-`Amiri said in (33/51 #10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A letter came in a handwriting I recognized: &#8220;Whoever names me in public may Allah&#8217;s curse be upon him.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It must be serious if he&#8217;s cursing, as if he&#8217;s scared he&#8217;d be exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: The emissary says he recognized the handwriting, so what? How can he recognize it anyway if the kid has never written letters before? How can you know if this latter came from the 12th Imam if he was hidden the moment he was born and never came into contact with anybody!? I add, couldn&#8217;t letters be easily forged at the time!? Didn&#8217;t they forge letters in the name of `Uthman, `Ali and `A&#8217;ishah during the Fitnah!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These reports make it seem as if the emissaries themselves don&#8217;t meet the Imam in person, as if they&#8217;re only in contact with him through these letters. If this is established then even they could have been fooled by any forger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They attribute to their ancient Imams reports such as #12:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I asked al-Rida (as) about al-Qa&#8217;im, he replied: &#8220;His body shall not be seen nor will his name be mentioned.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(34/51 #2)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s funny is that the Shia want to convince us he&#8217;s born yet it is from his signs that the people won&#8217;t know of his birth!! What a contradiction!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I asked: &#8220;Who is our companion then?&#8221; He (as) replied: &#8220;Look for the one whose birth shall be hidden from the people, he will be your companion.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(36/51 #8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Until Allah sends one whose birth shall not be noticed. I asked: &#8220;Whose birth shall not be noticed?&#8221; He (as) replied: &#8220;One that people won&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s born or not, that is your companion.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Majlisi then quotes the words of their leader al-Tusi in (201-202/51)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for Ja`far bin `Ali, the uncle of the owner of the age (as), he rejected the words of the Imami Shia who said his brother al-Hasan bin `Ali (as) had a son in his life. He rejected the boy&#8217;s existence then took his possessions and inheritence. Then Ja`far requested from the Sultan to arrest the female servants of al-Hasan (as) and made them observe al-Istibra&#8217; (waiting period after pregnancy) so he may prove with certainty that his brother never had a son. He then permitted the spilling of the blood of Shia who claimed that al-Hasan (as) had a successor who was more worthy than him. This does not raise a doubt for the knowledgeable ones since everyone agrees that Ja`far was not infallible like the prophets, he is capable of refusing truth and speaking falsehood. Rather, he is prone to error just like we find in the Qur&#8217;an, Ya`qub&#8217;s children mistreating their brother Yusuf even though they were sons of prophets, some believed that they themselves are prophets. If this great mistake is possible for them then why would it not be possible for Ja`far bin `Ali to do the same with his nephew due to greed and the desire to acquire worldly benefits.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why they claim that this Ja`far is a liar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We learn from this that al-`Askari&#8217;s own brother denied that he had a son, he disputed with the Shia and contacted the authorities to settle the dispute. They then proved that none of these women were pregnant as the Shia of the time claimed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hakimah never said a word of course, she had no objection to Ja`far&#8217;s actions since the man really had no children. Shia would like us to believe she never spoke due to Taqiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to learn more about the true events surrounding the 12th Imam, refer to the last section of our article:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/10/30/the-shia-mahdi/" rel="external nofollow">The Shia Mahdi: history of confusion</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tusi continues in his defense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[If it was said to us: How can al-Hasan bin `Ali (as) have a son when during his last sickness, he transmitted his will to his mother who was named in a narration and called Umm al-Hasan. He offered her his endowments, his charities and made her in charge of this. If he (as) had a son he would have mentioned him in his will. We respond: He (as) only did so, intentionally, to hide his birth and conceal him from the Sultan. If he (as) mentioned his son or transmitted his will to him, he would have opposed his own goal. Especially since he (as) had to bring as witnesses the top figures in the government as well as the judges to guard his endowments and charities and to conceal and protect his child by ignoring him and neglecting his mention.<br />
Whoever thinks that this is evidence against the Imami Shia&#8217;s belief in a son for al-Hasan (as) does not recognize the habits (of the time). Ja`far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq (as) did a similar thing when he passed his will to five individuals, starting with the Sultan al-Mansur. He did not pass it exclusively to his son Musa (as) and took as witnesses al-Rabi`, the judge and the mother of his son, a servant called Hamidah al-Barbariyyah. He finished it by mentioning his son Musa bin Ja`far (as) so as to keep him concealed and guard him from harm, he never mentioned any of his other children since he suspected that some would falsely claim his position and argue that they&#8217;re included in the will. If Musa hadn&#8217;t been popular among his kids, of known lineage, location, knowledge and virtue and had been concealed instead, then he wouldn&#8217;t have mentioned him, he would have mentioned others as al-Hasan bin `Ali (as) did with the owner of the age.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi finds resemblance between a man who mentioned his son in his will and another who didn&#8217;t mention his son in his will!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: We see al-Hasan al-`Askari ignoring this so called son, instead he bequeathed the authority over his charities and endowments to his mother as al-Tusi states. Of course whenever the Shia encounter a historical event that opposes their view, they shout &#8220;Taqiyyah!&#8221; in this way history holds no meaning and they manipulate anything to suite their story. The fact is, al-Hasan never mentioned his son in his will as opposed to previous Imams, he could have included his son&#8217;s name among several other names as al-Sadiq did according to al-Tusi, instead he acted as if there was no successor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s funny is that al-Tusi claims the emissaries themselves were of great status in th eye of the Sultan whom they&#8217;re supposed to be afraid of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They (i.e emissaries) were of great status in the eyes of the Sultan of that time because of their high value and respected positions. They were treated with honor due to their trust and they were famous for their justice to an extent that he (i.e Sultan) would defend them from the accusations of their opponents]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this, we are done with the narrations pertaining to the 12th Imam&#8217;s birth and the events surrounding it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CONCLUSION:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far we&#8217;re concluding from all the above,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Shia sects differed on whether al-`Askari had a son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; They&#8217;re confused about his mother&#8217;s identity, many names are mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Al-`Askari never spoke of him due to fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; No signs of pregnancy were shown on any of the Imam&#8217;s women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The baby was not in al-`Askari&#8217;s house, he was carried by birds, angels or taken God knows where.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Nobody was allowed to mention his name thus the people (Sunnah &amp; Shia) weren&#8217;t able to know his name since it was secret.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; He was hidden so no one saw him or knew where he was. Only one man (the emmissary) would claim to be in direct contact with him and whenever an emissary dies he&#8217;d be succeeded by another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The regular people living at the time never knew al-`Askari had a son, they thought the lineage was cut.</p>
<p>&#8211; The Imam never mentioned he had a son in his will.</p>
<p>&#8211; The Imam&#8217;s brother said he never had a son, a group from the Shia opposed him.</p>
<p>&#8211; The ones who claimed to have been in contact with this hidden leader are four emissaries, they were the link between the Shia and their leader. We ask, at that time the number of descendants of al-Hasan and al-Husayn was very large, couldn&#8217;t they find among the hundreds of descendants a few who were trustworthy to act as link between the 12th leader and the people? Why trust these four strangers!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia wish for us to believe in his birth and affirm his existence, yet the whole matter is a secret and the man&#8217;s birth and identity are supposed to be hidden from us according to your Imams. The reason according to the consensus of Shia scholars, led by al-Mufid, al-Tusi and al-Murtada is that he fears the enemies will kill him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If his existence is supposed to be hidden from everybody due to fear from the enemy and at the same time the only reason he does not emerge is because it is not yet safe according to the consensus of Shia leaders. This means that his existence must remain hidden, his name and his birth cannot be disclosed and therefore every Shia trying to convince us to believe in this ancient secret not only is contradicting himself but he&#8217;s also a sinner for jeopardizing his Imam&#8217;s safety!!</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/10/issues-of-ghaybah/">Click</a> to see list of all articles from the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/10/issues-of-ghaybah/">Ghaybah</a> series</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon this nation and its Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you all know, many different Shia sects claimed they are truthful, each sect believed in a different Mahdi whom they claimed did not die and will return to fill the earth with justice, such as the Nawousiyyah who believed Ja`far was the Mahdi, the Kaysaniyyah who believed Ibn al-Hanafiyyah is the Mahdi or the Waqifiyyah who believed Musa was the Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelver Shia scholars believe al-`Askari&#8217;s son is the Mahdi so they try refuting these other sects. From their most common arguments is that these other men cannot be the awaited Mahdi since we heard that they died or that people saw their execution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review our article (<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/10/30/the-shia-mahdi/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>) to see the various men claimed to be &#8220;The awaited Mahdi&#8221; by different Shia sects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Twelver argument:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote al-Mufid from Bihar al-Anwar vol.37 pg.12:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the sect of Nawousiyyah, by denying the death of abi `Abdillah (as) (then claiming his Mahdawaiyyah) they have committed the fault of rejecting what is known by necessity and what was witnessed. This is because knowing his death is just like knowing his father&#8217;s death before him, in this case there would be no difference between this sect and other sects of extremists who rejected the death of Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen (as), or those who denied the death of al-Husayn (as) then claimed that it had only appeared to the people.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote al-Tusi from al-Ghaybah pg.23:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What proves the corruption of the Madhab of al-Waqifah who stopped at abu al-Hasan Musa (as) and said: &#8220;He is the Mahdi&#8221;. Their belief is corrupt due to his apparent death, it became famous just as his father&#8217;s death became famous and his grandfather as well as his fathers before them. If we were to be suspicious about whether he truly died, then we&#8217;d be no different than the Nawousiyyah, the Kaysaniyyah, the Ghulaat and the Mufawwidah who also rejected the death of his past fathers (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Refuting the Twelver argument:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as you can see, their main argument usually is that the man is not the Mahdi, since his death was reported or witnessed and then it became popular knowledge. We will refute this argument from their own books and what they narrated from their own Imams below Insha-Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia narrated the following about the identity of the &#8220;Qa&#8217;im&#8221;  and his signs in their books of Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read in both Al-Ghaybah by al-Tusi and Al-Imamah wal-Tabsirah by Ibn Babuwayh:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sulayman b. Dawud narrated from `Ali b. Abi Hamza from Abu Basir. He said: I heard Abu Ja`far (as) saying: There are four traditions (sunan) from four prophets in the possessor of this affair (Mahdi): a tradition from Musa, a tradition from `Isa, a tradition from Yusuf, and a tradition from Muhammad (saw). As what [is from] Musa it is (he will) fear, being vigilant. As to what [is from] Yusuf it is the imprisonment. As to what [is from] `Isa, so it will be said: He died, and he did not die. And as to what [is from] Muhammad (saw) it is the sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read in Kama-ul-Deen by Ibn Babuwayh:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My father and Ibn al-Walid, from al-Himyari from Muhammad b. `Isa from Sulayman b. Dawud from Abu Basir: The possessor of this affair shall have four traditions (sunan) from four prophets: a tradition from Musa, a tradition from `Isa, a tradition from Yusuf, and a tradition from Muhammad (saw). As for Musa then he is fearful and on the lookout. as for Yusuf then it is the prison, as for `Isa it shall be said: &#8220;He died&#8221; but he did not die, as for Muhammad (saw) then it is the sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We observe in al-Ghaybah bin al-Nu`mani:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Ali b. Ahmad narrated to us from `Ubaydullah b. Musa from `Abdullah b. Jabala from al-Hasan b. Abi Hamza from Abu Basir. He said: I heard Abu Ja`far al-Baqir (as) saying: There are four traditions (sunan) from four prophets in the possessor of the affair: a tradition from Musa, a tradition from `Isa, a tradition from Yusuf, and a tradition from Muhammad (saw). So I said: What is the tradition of Musa? He said: (He will) fear, being vigilant. I said: What is the tradition of `Isa? So he said: It will be said regarding him what is said regarding `Isa. I said: So what is the tradition of Yusuf? He said: The prison and the absence. I said: And what is the tradition of Muhammad (saw)? He said: When he rises, he will take the course of the conduct of the Messenger of Allah (saw), except that he will clarify the ways of Muhammad (saw), and put the sword upon his shoulder for eight months in turmoil and tumult until Allah is pleased. I said: How will he know the pleasure of Allah? He said: Allah will cast mercy in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrations above in which a companion of the Imam asks about the signs of Sahib-ul-Amr (The awaited Mahdi), the Imam explains that he shall resemble four different prophets in four different things. Based on these four signs we shall see whether these descriptions fit the 12th Imam and whether the Twelvers have a ground to stand on in refuting other Shia sects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- The awaited Qa&#8217;im will be like Muhammad (saw) in that he shall declare armed struggle and fight with the sword, this is of course after he rises and appears. All Shia sects agree on this concept and that&#8217;s the only way the earth will be filled with justice as it was filled with oppression in such a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- The awaited Qa&#8217;im will be like Musa (as) in that he shall be followed by his enemies and so he will be very cautious while in a state of fear. All Shia sects agree on this and this is the excuse they use as to why those men disappeared without trace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- The awaited Qa&#8217;im will be like Yusuf (as) in that he shall be imprisoned by his enemies. In this sense we see that the Kaysani as well as the Waqifi Shia have more right for their claims than the Qat&#8217;i Ithna-`Ashariyyah. This is because Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, the Mahdi of the Kaysaniyyah was imprisoned in the time of `Abdullah bin al-Zubayr, also Musa bin Ja`far the Mahdi of the Waqifah was imprisoned by the Caliph of his time. On the other hand, Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-`Askari who is the Mahdi of the Twelvers was never imprisoned or caught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- The awaited Qa&#8217;im will be like `Isa (as) and this is because `Isa (as) was made to appear as if he died but he never really died. This is why the people will differ, it shall be popularly known that he died while others will deny it, such as in our days only the Muslims believe he did not die on the cross. This fact alone cancels the argument of the likes of al-Mufid, al-Tusi and al-Murtada who say that other so called Mahdies are not legitimate because it&#8217;s said that they died or that some people claimed to have witnesses their death, well in this case it would not be any different than those who claimed to witness `Isa&#8217;s (as) death as it was made to appear.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The belief in the “messiah” is a widespread belief shared by the majority of religions, it is the belief that at the end of times we shall be delivered by a promised one, a savior who will lead us to God, vanquish our enemies and rule humanity with justice. Just as the Jews in Arabia awaited a promised prophet at the end of times to grant them victory so did the Christians as they await the second advent of `Isa (as) who will rule a kingdom with no end. The Muslims are no different in this regard; our Prophet (saw) had promised us that we shall be under the authority of a fair and just ruler; he is the guided one, the Mahdi who will be born at the end of times. The savior of the Muslims shall rule for seven years according to reliable mainstream narrations then the authority will be transferred to prophet `Isa (as) who will rule forty years and defeat the enemies of Islam and their Dajjal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many legitimate books discussed the Mahdi and what our Prophet (saw) said about him based on the reliable and authentic reports, from them we list “Al-Ahadith al-Waridah fil-Mahdi fi Mizan al-Jarh wal-Ta`dil” by `Abdul-`Alim `Abdul-`Azim &amp; “Al-Mahdi wa Fiqh Ashrat-ul-Sa`ah” by Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Isma`il al-Muqaddim and plenty of others…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our research in this piece shall not be regarding the true Mahdi that the majority of Muslims believe in nor is it related to the beliefs of the average Muslim you may encounter, rather we will be discussing historical personalities who were falsely claimed to be the “Mahdi” by a small group of deviants calling themselves “The Shia”. For this purpose we shall go through the books of the Shia sects as well as the books of the expert scholars and renowned historians who interacted with such sects and often debated their leaders and collected their books, all while documenting the early beliefs held by these groups, especially those of the various Shia sects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Many people throughout history claimed to be the Mahdi, even in our days one may find a few especially in Iran, Yemen and `Iraq. The claimants were Hashemites, Arabs and even non-Arabs; this research will only cover those who were documented in the early days and were claimed to be Mahdies only by the Shia groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give the readers an idea of how obsessed certain Muslims have become with the character of “The Mahdi”, we refer you to an article published by the economist called “Iran’s multiplicity of messiahs” on Apr 27th 2013, Tehran (print edition). We quote some passages:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[EARLIER this year Iran’s authorities arrested a score of men who, in separate incidents, claimed to be the Mahdi, a sacred figure of Shia Islam, who was “hidden” by God just over a millennium ago and will return some time to conquer evil on earth. (etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iran’s economic doldrums may have helped to cause this surge in people claiming to be mankind’s saviour—and in women saying they were the Mahdi’s wife. (etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year a seminary expert, Mehdi Ghafari, said that more than 3,000 fake Mahdis were in prison. Mahdi-complexes are common, says a Tehran psychiatrist. (etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most famous case was that of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2007 for allegedly—among other things—claiming he was the Mahdi. (etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Ahmadinejad has called his administration “the government of the hidden imam”. Last month he told a batch of new Iranian ambassadors to consider themselves “envoys of the Mahdi”. (etc…)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah save us from deviance,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-Sources used in this research-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Main Shia sources relied upon in this study:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Firaq al-Shi`ah by Sa`d bin `Abdullah al-Ash`ari al-Qummi [d.299AH] &amp; Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti [d.310AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Description: This book is actually two books, al-Maqalat wal-Firaq by Sa`d al-Qummi and Firaq al-Shi`ah by Hasan al-Nawbakhti.  Al-Nawbakhti who is a popular Imami philosopher and theologian first wrote his book and then al-Qummi who is an Ithna-`Ashari scholar of Hadith adopted it and added to it his own explanations and comments and so both books were merged and published as one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Al-Zinah fil-Kalimat al-Islamiyyah al-`Arabiyyah by Ahmad bin Hamdan al-Razi [d.322AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Description: While being a linguistic book, al-Zinah is known to have an entire volume dedicated to the origins of the names and titles of Islamic sects. The author Ibn Hamdan being an Isma`ili Shia took great care of listing the various different Shia sects and seems to agree with al-Nawbakhti’s work for the most part.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Al-Maniyah wal-Amal Sharh al-Milal wal-Nihal by al-Mahdi Ahmad bin al-Murtada al-Hasani [d.840AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Description: A rare book of sects written by the popular Zaydi Shia scholar Ibn al-Murtada. This author had access to some of the rarest of lost books quotes early scholars such as abu `Isa al-Warraq [d.247AH], al-Qadi `Abdul-Jabbar [d.415AH] and al-Hakim al-Jushami [d.494AH]. This book describes the Mu`tazili sects in great detail while also listing some interesting information related to the Imamiyyah and the Zaydi Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Bihar-ul-Anwar al-Jami` li-Akhbar al-A’immah al-Athar by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi [d.1111AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Description: An encyclopedia of Shia traditions written by the father of modern day Ithna-`Ashari Shia. In the thirty seventh volume of his book he quotes details about the various Shia sects from the book “al-Fusoul” by the popular early Rafidi preacher al-Shaykh al-Mufid [d.413AH].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The Occultation of the Twelfth Imam: A Historical Background by Jasim M. Husayn [contemporary]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Description: A book recently written by a Twelver Shia researcher on the topic of their 12<sup>th</sup> hidden Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-List of men the Shia claimed to be the “Mahdi” at the end of times-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1) `Ali ibn abi Talib:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first of the ideological Shia was a sect called “al-Saba’iyyah” and they founded the belief in Ghaybah and Raj`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said: `Ali was not killed and he did not die. They said that he would not die until he had driven the Arabs with his cane and filled the earth with justice and fairness, after it has been filled with oppression and injustice. This was the first sect in Islam that believed in Waqf (stopping at a certain man’s leadership and not granting it to others after his death), after the Prophet (saw), and his family. They were also the first extremists (Ghulat). They were called “al-Saba’iyyah”, the followers of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/09/18/abdullah-ibn-saba-the-book/" rel="external nofollow">Abdullah ibn Saba</a>’ who disowned Abu Bakr, Umar, `Uthman and the rest of the Companions, then he claimed that `Ali ordered him to do this so `Ali questioned him about it and he confessed so he ordered his execution] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (Ibn Saba’) was the first to declare that the Imamah of `Ali was mandatory, he disowned his enemies and attacked his opponents and accused them of Kufr] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And they claimed his (`Ali’s) Ghaybah (occultation) after his death and stopped (made Wuqouf) at his leadership (not exceeding it to others from his children). They said he is al-Qa’im who shall arise, that he is alive not dead, he shall not die until he rules the Arabs with his stick and fills the earth with justice and equality just as it was filled with tyranny.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And his (Ibn Saba’s) companions claimed that `Ali was in the clouds, and that thunder is his voice and lightning is his whip] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2 – 3) Al-Hasanayn “Al-Hasan &amp; al-Husayn”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hasanayn were both thought to be the awaited saviors by some of their Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They did not establish Imamah for anybody else after them (Meaning after the first three Imams), they instead believed in their Raj`ah(return) but not to teach people their religion. However, they shall return to seek vengeance, kill their enemies and (punish) those who usurped their rights; this is their belief concerning the appearance of the Mahdi and the rising of al-Qa’im.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4) Muhammad ibn `Ali “Ibn al-Hanafiyyah”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a group of the early Shia who claimed Ibn al-Hanafiyyah was the Mahdi and they are known as the “Kaysaniyyah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said that Muhammad bin al-Hanafiyyah was the Imam al-Mahdi, he is the executor of `Ali ibn abi Talib’s will, none of his household may disobey his command, they cannot take anyone other than him as their leader nor can they raise their swords without his permission.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They claimed that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah is Imam al-Mahdi, he is the awaited al-Qa’im who shall fill the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression. They claimed he appointed al-Mukhtar as leader of his Shia and ordered him to seek vengeance for al-Husayn and called him Kaysan.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Mukhtar was a “Kaysani” who believed in Raj`ah, he said that Muhammad bin al-Hanafiyyah will die then be resurrected with his Shia and will fill the earth with justice. He also claimed that his rebellion was ordered by him (Ibn al-Hanafiyyah) (…etc…) And he dominated al-Koufah until a group of its people fled to al-Basarah seeking their aid against al-Mukhtar, so the Basri army marched behind Mus`ab bin al-Zubayr and fought (al-Mukhtar) in Koufah. In Mus`ab’s army was `Ubaydullah bin `Ali ibn abi Talib and Muhammad bin al-Ash`ath bin Qays so al-Mukhtar killed them both then he was killed] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This sect believed in the Imamah of abu al-Qasim Muhammad bin Amir-ul-Mu’minin ibn Khawlah al-Hanafiyyah and they claimed he was the Mahdi who fills the earth with justice and fairness just as it was once filled with oppression and tyranny, and that he is alive, he never died nor will he die until he appears with truth (…etc…) They argued he was the Mahdi based on the prophetic-narration: “The days and nights shall not end until Allah sends a man from my household, his name matches mine and so does his Kuniyah and his father’s name (…etc…) They argued that from the names of Amir-ul-Mu’minin was `Abdullah because he said: “I am the slave of Allah (`Abdullah), and the brother of Allah’s messenger (saw) and the greatest Siddiq, no one claims it after me except a liar.”] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5) `Abdullah bin Muhammad “abu Hashim”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The eldest son of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah was also the “Mahdi” according to a group of Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group attributed to him the same statement the Kaysani sect attributed to his father before him: That he is al-Mahdi, he is alive not dead, he can revive the dead and they went into extremes in raising his status.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They said that `Abdullah was dead but he will make a return (Raj`ah) and that he is the Mahdi who will emerge to fill the earth with justice just as it was filled with tyranny.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was also said that from them were some who said that `Abdullah bin Muhammad is alive and he never died and that he is al-Qa’im] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6) `Abdullah “The descendant of Ja`far bin abi Talib”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Abdullah bin Mu`awiyah bin `Abdullah bin Ja`far bin abi Talib was also said to be the Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said: `Abdullah bin Mu`awiyah is al-Mahdi, who was mentioned by the messenger (saw) and his family and he will lead the world, to fill it with goodness and justice after it was filled with injustice and oppression. Then, when he died, he will leave his position to someone from Bani Hashim from the descendant of `Ali bin Abi Talib.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They claimed that `Abdullah bin Mu`awiyah is alive and never dies, that he is dwelling in the mountains of Asbahan and will not die until he rises and he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi whom the Prophet (saw) promised so he will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with tyranny and then hand it to a man from banu Hashim at the moment of his death.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7) Muhammad “The descendant of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Hashimi” Shia believed the Mahdi to be from Muhammad bin `Ali’s progeny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[So `Ali bin Muhammad (bin al-Hanafiyyah) made his son al-Hasan bin `Ali the executor of his will, his mother is Umm Walad, and al-Hasan made his son `Ali bin al-Hasan the executor of his will, his mother is Lubanah bint abi Hashim, and `Ali made his son al-Hasan bin `Ali the executor of his will, his mother is `Aliyyah bint `Awn bin `Ali bin Muhammad bin al-Hanafiyyah. For them the execution of the will is restricted to the descendants of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah and no one else, from them shall appear al-Qa’im al-Mahdi, they are the pure Kaysani sect who were popular for this title, this group specifically is known as “al-Mukhtariyyah.”] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They claimed that aba Hashim appointed his brother `Ali bin Muhammad, and `Ali appointed his son al-Hasan bin `Ali, and al-Hasan appointed his son `Ali bin al-Hasan, so the Imamah according to them is in the children of Muhammad bin al-Hanafiyyah, it does not go to anyone else and from them will arise al-Qa’im al-Mahdi.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8) Ja`far bin Muhammad:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aba `Abdillah was claimed to be the Mahdi by a group of his Shia and they became known as the “Nawousiyyah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said: Ja`far bin Muhammad did not die and he will not die until he revolts and rule the people and he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi, they narrated from him that he said: “If you see my head tumbling down from atop a mountain, do not believe it as I am the (awaited) one.” And they narrated from him: “If there should come to you a person claiming that he washed me and shrouded me and buried me; do not believe him for I am the one, the possessor of the sword.” This group I called “al-Nawousiyyah”.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They were called that because a man from the people of Basarah called Ibn Nawous claimed that Ja`far bin Muhammad didn’t die; he shall remain alive until he reappears and receives authority; he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi. Him and his followers claimed that they narrated from him (Ja`far) that he said: “If you see my head dropping down from a mountain then do not be fooled, for I am your companion, the owner of the sword.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The “Nawousiyyah” who are attributed to one of their leaders from the people of Basarah called Nawous. They claimed that Ja`far bin Muhammad is alive, he never died nor will he die until he rules the earth, and he is the awaited Mahdi.] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Until the opinions differed after the death of abi `Abdillah Ja`far bin Muhammad, a group said: Aba `Abdillah is alive not dead, he doesn’t die until he appears and fills the earth with justice and fairness as it was filled with tyranny and oppression because he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi. They clung to a narration by `Anbasah bin Mus`ab from abu `Abdillah that he said: “If there comes to you someone informing you that he had washed me, shrouded me and buried me, do not believe him.” This group was called “al-Nawousiyyah” because their leader was a man from Basarah called `Abdullah ibn Nawous.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9) Isma`il bin Ja`far:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Isma`il was claimed to be alive and in Ghaybah by a group of his father’s Shia and they are a group of “al-Isma`iliyyah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group claimed that the Imam after Ja`far is his son Isma`il bin Ja`far, they denied the death of Isma`il during his father&#8217;s life – saying it was a trick plotted by his father, who was afraid for him, so he hid him. They claimed Isma`il would not die until he ruled the world and cared for the people and that he was al-Qa’im, because his father appointed him for the Imamah after him and told them about it and the Imam cannot say except the truth.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Many people believed in his Imamah during the life of Ja`far from his companions and he never opposed them, some folks even said that Isma`il never died but that his father sent him into a state of Ghaybah out of fear for him. They said: “How can it be so (meaning his death), when Ja`far had appointed him over us and order us to obey him (etc…)”] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10) Muhammad bin Isma`il bin Ja`far:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group from the “Qaramitah” said he was the final Imam and Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They were originally of the same belief as the “Mubarakiyyah” but then they differed with them and said: There shall not be after Muhammad (saw) except seven Imams: They were `Ali bin Abi Talib, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, `Ali bin al-Husayn, Muhammad bin `Ali, Ja`far bin Muhammad and Muhammad bin Isma`il bin Ja`far, who was al-Qaim al-Mahdi and a messenger.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They claimed that Muhammad bin Isma`il is alive not dead, that he is hidden and occluded (Gha’ib Mustatir) in the lands of the Romans (Christian lands). The meaning of al-Qa’im according to them is that he shall be sent with a new law and message to abrogate those of Muhammad (saw)] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11) Musa bin Ja`far:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Musa was claimed to be the hidden savior by a great group of his father’s companions, later called “al-Waqifah” or “al-Mamtourah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The second group said: Musa bin Ja`far did not die, nor will he die until he rules the world from east to west. He would fill it with justice after it had been filled with oppression. They claimed that he was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi. They said that he feared death so he left the prison unseen during the day, however the Sultan and his followers claimed his death to fool the people with a (random) man who died in prison (…etc…) They narrated from his father Ja`far reports in which he said: “He (Musa) is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi, even if you spot his head tumbling down a mountain then do not believe it for he is the one to rise.”] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for those who claimed it (Imamah) for Musa, then they differed regarding (his son) `Ali after his death until some folks stopped at Musa and claimed he is alive not dead.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They claimed that he is alive and undying and that he is al-Qa’im who fills the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression. They stopped on his Imamah denying `Ali bin Musa after him and they narrated from Ja`far that he said that al-Qa’im is called after the prophet of the Torah (etc…)] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group of them stopped(Waqf) at abi al-Hasan Musa and claimed that he is alive and that he’s the awaited(al-Muntazar) Mahdi while another group of them said that he died by he shall be resurrected and he’s al-Qa’im. The Waqifah then differed regarding al-Rida and those who later came from the family of Muhammad (saw) after abi al-Hasan Musa, some of them said they were the deputies of abu al-Hasan and his generals and judges until the time of his appearance and that they aren’t Imams and they never claimed it at all. The others said they were misguided, sinful oppressors and they harshly criticized al-Rida and made Takfir on him and his progeny. Then an odd group who were once upon truth adopted a very silly belief so they denied abi al-Hasan’s death and imprisonment and claimed that this was an illusion to fool the people and claimed that he was alive in occultation, he was the Mahdi (etc…)] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>12) Muhammad bin `Abdullah “al-Nafs-ul-Zakiyyah son of al-Muthanna”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of the “Jaroudiyyah” claimed Ghaybah for a couple of individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It had been attributed to some of them that they believed in Ghaybah, as in the belief of a hidden leader whose appearance is awaited as the Imamiyyah believed. This was narrated by abu `Isa al-Warraq who said: The Jaroudiyyah differed, some said that Muhammad bin `Abdullah (bin al-Hasan bin al-Hasan bin `Ali bin abi Talib) is alive, he isn’t dead and will appear.] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: abu `Isa is Muhammad bin Haroun al-Warraq [d.247AH] a companion of the disbeliever Ibn al-Rawandi, he is a Mu`tazili and the Ithna `Ashari Shia consider him from their companions, he wrote about sects and comparative religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When abu Ja`far died, his companions split into two groups: The first believed in the Imamah of Muhammad bin `Abdullah bin al-Hasan bin al-Hasan bin `Ali bin Abi Talib who revolted in Madinah and was killed there. They claimed that he was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi and he is the Imam while denying his death. They said he is alive, not dead and he lives in a mountain (…etc…) according to them he dwells therein until his appearance because the messenger (saw) said: “The Qa’im al-Mahdi’s name matches mine and his father’s name matches my father’s.”] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They differed on the identity of the awaited Imam, is he Muhammad bin `Abdullah bin al-Hasan who was killed in al-Madinah in the time of al-Mansour. A sect claimed it and said he wasn’t killed.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13) Muhammad bin al-Qasim “abu Ja`far al-Taliqani”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another of the Zaydi extremists claimed it for Muhammad al-Sufi bin al-Qasim bin `Ali bin `Umar bin `Ali bin Husayn bin `Ali ibn abi Talib.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Another group claimed similarly (the occultation) in Muhammad bin al-Qasim al-Taliqani] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Or is he (The awaited Qa’im) Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin `Ali bin al-Husayn the one from al-Taliqan who was imprisoned by (Caliph) al-Mu`tasim until he died. A sect has claimed this and denied his death.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14) Yahya bin `Umar “abu al-Husayn Sahib al-Koufah”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another group from the “Jaroudiyyah” claimed it for Yahya bin `Umar bin Yahya bin Husayn bin Zayd bin `Ali bin Husayn bin `Ali bin abi Talib.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And a group said about Yahya bin `Umar the one (who rebelled) in al-Koufah similarly (that he was in Ghaybah and will return)] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Or is he (The awaited Qa’im) Yahya bin `Umar the one from al-Koufah, from the descendants of Zayd bin `Ali, he called for his own leadership and a great group followed him but he was killed in the time of (Caliph) al-Musta`in Billah thus a third group believed in him and denied his death.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>15) Husayn bin al-Qasim bin `Ali “Al-`Ayani”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Husayn bin Qasim bin `Ali bin `Abdullah bin Muhammad bin al-Qasim was claimed to be the awaited one, by a sect of the Shia in Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The “Mutarrifiyyah” are the followers of Mutarrif bin Shihab, they separated from the “Zaydiyyah” in many of their opinions and fundamentals which led many of the Zaydi scholars to label them as disbelievers. As for the “Husayniyyah” they exclusively claimed that al-Husayn bin al-Qasim bin `Ali who was killed in Raydah (in Yemen) had not died and that he must reappear before his death and these two sects are extinct] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16) Abu Muslim al-Khurasani:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A branch of the “Kaysaniyyah” practiced great Ghulu and claimed “Mahdawiyyah” for their leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group from them called the “Muslimiyyah” the companions of aba Muslim `Abdul-Rahman al-Khurasani, they said he was the Imam after he was killed, and they claimed he was alive, he never died nor was he killed. They permitted the prohibitions (of Islam), abandoned the obligatory duties and considered that faith was simply reduced to knowing their Imam (of their time).] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They used to be attributed to a leader they had called Rizzam, from them are those who claimed that aba Muslim is alive and did not die, and they worshipped by dropping obligatory acts (such as Salat, Siyam &amp; Zakat)] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[People from the “Rafidah” in Khurasan that appeared in the era of abu Muslim al-Khurasani and embraced the belief of the “Hulouliyyah”, they claimed that the divine godly spirit had united with abu Muslim’s body, and they claimed his Imamah.] (Ibn al-Murtada)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>17) Muhammad bin `Abdullah “Descendant of al-Husayn”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of Shia called “al-Mughiriyyah” claimed that he was the Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then Muhammad bin `Abdullah bin al-Hasan bin al-Husayn bin `Ali ibn abi Talib who rebelled in Madinah. They said he is alive and never dies nor was he killed, he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi who lives in a mountain called al-Tamiyah (…etc…) that he is the Imam after Muhammad bin `Abdullah until he emerges and fills the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>18) Al-Hasan bin `Ali “al-`Askari”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of the “Qat`iyyah” from the companions of al-Hasan al-`Askari claimed that he is the Mahdi and by doing so became “Waqifah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[One group said that al-Hasan bin `Ali is alive not dead, but he only disappeared and he is al-Qa’im, for it is impossible for him to die not leaving an acknowledged son since the earth cannot be devoid of an Imam. We have established the Imamah of al-Hasan bin `Ali, furthermore the narration states that the Qa’im has two Ghaybahs, this was one of them and he shall reappear and be known before his second Ghaybah.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said that al-Hasan is alive and not dead, he is al-Qa’im and it isn’t permitted for him to pass away apparently without leaving a son as the earth cannot be devoid of an Imam, we have also narrated that the Imam has two Ghaybahs as he will appear and be known and then reappear after a second Ghaybah. A second group said al-Hasan died but he shall be resurrected since he is al-Qa’im and we think that the word Qa’im (The one to rise) means that he shall rise after death.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>19) Muhammad bin `Ali “al-`Askari”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is the brother al-Hasan al-`Askari and a group of al-Hasan’s Shia claimed Mahdawiyyah for him after al-Hasan died without leaving behind a son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When `Ali bin Muhammad bin `Ali bin Musa al-Rida died, a group from his companions believed in the Imamah of his son, Muhammad, who died in (the city of) Surra-man-Ra’a (Samarra’) during his father&#8217;s life, they also claimed he was alive and he never died, their argument was that his father pointed to him and informed them of his Imamah after him. They said that the Imam cannot lie nor can al-Bada’ occur in such matters; they said that even though his death appears to have taken place in his father’s time but in reality he didn’t die, his father had feared for him so he hid him (Ghayyabahu) and he was al-Mahdi] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Al-Bada’ is the popular belief that some early Shia had, it means that Allah may change his judgment based on the changing circumstances and that things appear to be a certain way to Him but then something else would happen so He would alter His judgment as a result. The expert scholars said that this was a ruse used by the Shia in case their “divine predictions” fail and so al-Bada’ would be their excuse just as Taqiyyah is an excuse for their contradictions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A fifth group said that al-Hasan died and he was never an Imam, we were wrong to claim it for him since the true Imam was Muhammad bin `Ali the brother of Hasan and Ja`far who died in his father’s life. This is because al-Hasan passed without leaving a son while Ja`far is undeserving since he is openly corrupt and so was al-Hasan although he hides it. Therefore, since both men’s Imamah is false then we realized that the true Imam was Muhammad since he had a progeny and his father pointed to him and he is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi and nobody else otherwise Imamah falls.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group from them said that the Imam after abu al-Hasan is Muhammad bin `Ali the brother of abu Muhammad. They claimed that his father `Ali had appointed him during his life but this Muhammad died in his father’s life so they rejected his death and they claimed he never died and he is the living awaited Imam.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>20) Ja`far bin `Ali “al-`Askari”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was called “al-Kazzab” by the followers of his brother and they denied him the status of Imamah especially since he denied that his brother al-Hasan had any children but another group of his father’s Shia had another opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[They believed in the Imamah of Ja`far based on that and debated others about it. This group is very harsh against abu Muhammad al-Hasan bin `Ali, they accuse him and those who followed him of disbelief. They also go to extremes in their belief concerning Ja`far and claimed he was al-Qa’im and preferred him over the commander of believers `Ali ibn abi Talib as well as al-Hasan wal-Husayn and the rest of the Imams and their reason for doing so is that: The Qa’im is the best of creations after the messenger of Allah (saw).] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A few from the group deviated from the original path and said that the Imam after Muhammad bin `Ali bin Muhammad bin `Ali bin Musa is his brother Ja`far bin `Ali and they claimed that his father pointed to him after Muhammad and that he is the Qa’im after his father] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>21) Muhammad “The first” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A son some group claimed al-Hasan had two years before his death and he is the Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The sixth group said that al-Hasan bin `Ali had a son called Muhammad and he pointed to him and thus it isn’t as they claimed that he passed without successors. How can he be an established Imam and the executor of his father’s will as was popular among the closest of people as well as the general public and then he dies without a successor!? Rather, his successor is present and born two years before his death (…etc…) They claimed that his father ordered him to hide during his life out of fear for him so he is hiding and scared from his uncle Ja`far and others from his enemies and this is one of his Ghaybahs so he is al-Imam al-Qa’im. He was known in his father’s life and he appointed him and he has no other children so he is without a doubt the Imam.] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The sixth group said that al-Hasan bin `Ali had a son unlike they said about his death without children and his name was Muhammad, born two years before his father’s passing, he is afraid and hiding from Ja`far (his uncle) and others from his enemies and he is the Imam al-Qa’im.] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>22) Muhammad “The second” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A son some group claimed al-Hasan had eight months after his death and he is the Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The seventh said: Rather, his son was born eight months after his passing, as for those who claimed that he had a son during his life then they’re liars and impostors. If that were the case then it (the pregnancy) would not have been hidden just as previous ones weren’t hidden. However, he passed without having any known children and one cannot be so arrogant in these matters nor must one deny what was witnessed in plain sight and known by all. In previous pregnancies the matter was established and apparent and recorded by the Sultan while being witnessed by the common folk but in this case his inheritance wasn’t even split due to this issue, so he had a son who was born eight months after his death and he requested that he be named Muhammad. This was what he willed and he is hidden and unseen. This group used as evidence and argument what was narrated from abu al-Hasan al-Rida: “You shall be trialed through the fetus in his mother’s womb and the infant.” They said this was him (meaning Muhammad bin al-Hasan).] (Al-Qummi &amp; al-Nawbakhti)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The seventh said: No, he had a son who was born eight months after his death and as for the son they claimed was born two years before his death, this is false since it cannot be hidden and one must not be so arrogant since there was a pregnancy after his passing and this was claimed (by some)] (Ibn Hamdan al-Razi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NOTE: What is ironic is that the Shia sect called “Ithna `Ashariyyah” or “twelver” who is dominant in our days believes that the 12<sup>th</sup> Imam was five years old when his father passed away. In other words, they disagree with the above-mentioned teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[His (12<sup>th</sup> Imam’s) age at the time of his father’s death was five years old when Allah had given him wisdom, decisive speech and made him a sign for the worlds] (Al-Irshad al-Mufid)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We shall mention them below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>23) Muhammad “The third” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one born five years before his father’s death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Many of them said that his age was five years at that point since his father passed away at two-hundred sixty and the birth of al-Qa’im was in the year two-hundred fifty five] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>24) Muhammad “The fouth” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Some said, he was born in the year two-hundred fifty two and that his age at his father’s passing was eight. They claimed that his father never died until Allah perfected his intellect and taught him wisdom and decisive speech and made him unique from among all his creations (…etc…) And they said the one responsible for this affair is alive not dead, and he never dies even if he remained for a thousand years until he fills the earth with (…etc…) At the time of his appearance he shall be a strong young man who is in his thirties and this was from his miracles and this was from his signs.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Al-Mufid didn’t know how right he was since the so called savior has been absent for more than a thousand two-hundred years now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>25) Muhammad “The fetus” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group apparently claimed that the Ghaybah of this so called Mahdi is in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said that aba Muhammad died without an apparent child. However, there was pregnancy in his female servants and the Qa’im after al-Hasan is the one carried by his mother and that she never gave birth to him yet but it’s permitted for her to remain pregnant for a hundred years until she delivers him then he’d appear.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>26) Muhammad “The deceased” bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group claimed their Mahdi was dead but will return from death at the end of times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Another group said: The Imam after al-Hasan is his son Muhammad, he is the awaited one. However, Muhammad died but he shall be revived and will rise with the sword to fill the earth with justice and equality just as it was filled with (etc..)] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>27) `Ali bin al-Hasan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group said they believed al-Hasan had a son but decided his name was `Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group said that the Imam after al-Hasan is his awaited son and that he is `Ali bin al-Hasan and not Muhammad bin al-Hasan like the “Qat`iyyah” claim. This group literally believed in the same things the “Qat`iyyah” did concerning the occultation and the waiting word for word.] (Al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>28) Mahdies after the Mahdi:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, the Shia sects where so out of control and far from Allah’s guidance that they began to claim a large number of Mahdies to appear after their Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From abi Hamzah, from abi `Abdillah (as) in a long narration that he said: “O aba Hamzah, after al-Qa’im there shall be eleven Mahdies from us from the progeny of al-Husayn (as).”] (Bihar-ul-Anwar al-Majlisi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From Amir-ul-Mu’minin (as), he said: The messenger of Allah (saw) said on the night of his death to `Ali (as): “O aba al-Hasan, bring me a pen and paper” So he (saw) wrote his entire will until he reached one section then said: “O `Ali, there will be after me twelve Imams and after them shall come twelve Mahdies. You O `Ali are the first of the twelve Imams.”] (Bihar-ul-Anwar al-Majlisi)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-The split of the Imamiyyah after the death of the 11<sup>th</sup> Imam-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the confusion of the followers of the `Askari Imams from the descendants of al-Rida, they became confused and split into many groups (around twenty) after the death of al-Hasan al-`Askari without any children to succeed him. Below we will quote the work by J. M. Husayn and in order to give our readers a description of how confused the Shia were concerning this alleged 12<sup>th</sup> Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote J. M. Husayn below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sa’d al-Qummi counted fifteen schisms, whereas al-Nawbakhti and al-Mufid enumerated them as fourteen. Al-Mas`udi thinks that there were twenty sects (in al-Murouj), while al-Shahristani counts only eleven. Nevertheless a study of the claims of these factions reveals that there were apparently only five major schisms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, each of these became further split over the theological and traditional arguments employed to support their claims. At any rate it seems important to set down the major claims of these schisms in order to achieve a clear conception of the Imamiyyah at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schism I: the Waqifah at al-`Askari</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What brought the people of this faction together was their claim that the eleventh Imam, al-`Askari, was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi although they differed as to how he became al-Qa’im.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i) The first faction of this schism deemed that al- `Askari had not died, but had gone into occultation. They based their assumption on the traditions reported from the previous Imams, which said that an Imam could not die without having a publicly acknowledged son to succeed him, because the world cannot be without a Proof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the people were not obliged to accept the Imamate of those who were now laying claim to it, they should acknowledge the Imamate of al­`Askari whose Imamate had been confirmed by the testament of the former Imam. They also maintained that they had a tradition which said that al-Qa’im had two occultations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, since al-`Askari had not left a publicly acknowledged son and since the earth cannot remain for an hour without a Proof, it was right to claim that he had not died but was hidden, and that he was truly al-Qa’im.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was his first occultation, after which he would rise again. Then, when his rising became known, he would conceal himself once more in his second occultation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their discussions with their opponents, they tried to distinguish themselves from the Imamiyyah who had stopped at the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim (183/799), claiming he was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi, by faulting them for stopping at al-Kadhim. They pointed out that he had died and left his successor, `Ali al-Rida (202/817) as well as other sons, while al-`Askari had obviously passed away and left no heir.</p>
<p>ii) The second faction of the Waqifah at al-`Askari believed that he had died, but was then raised to life, and was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi Basically, the members of this faction established their doctrine on a transmission from Imam Ja`far al-Sadiq, who said that al-Qa’im was called al-Qa’im because he would &#8220;rise&#8221; again after his death. They stated that it was certain that al-`Askari had died without leaving a successor and without designating anyone as his legatee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus there was no doubt about his being al-Qa’im, nor about his being alive after death, although he concealed himself for fear of his foes. They supported their theories with a saying of Imam `Ali bin Abi Talib, contained in his advice to his follower <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/01/22/dua-kumayl-not-authentic/" rel="external nofollow">Kumayl </a>bin Ziyad, &#8220;O Allah, indeed You do not leave the earth without a Qa’im with proof from You, whether manifest or hidden, for then Your proofs and Your signs would be invalidated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of `Ali&#8217;s words they concluded that al-`Askari was absent and hidden, but that he would rise to fill the earth with peace and justice after it had been filled with tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iii) Al-Waqifah al-la Adriyyah also stopped at al-`Askari. They deemed that he had died and had been the Imam. Although the earth could not be without a Proof from Allah, they were not sure who had succeeded al-`Askari, his son or his brother. Therefore they stopped at the Imamate of al-`Askari, and decided to make no decision until the matter became clear to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the contemporary sources do not mention anyone as representing the three factions of al-Waqifah at al-`Askari. However, from the doctrine of the first faction of the Waqifah, it seems that its partisans lived in places which were far from Samarra’, the city of the Imam. Since they were not present at the moment of his death, they tended to believe that he had not in fact died, but was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schism II: The Ja`farites</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The representatives of this schism claimed that the Imam after al­`Askari was his youngest brother, Ja`far, but they differed as to how the Imamate had passed on to him, and therefore split into four factions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i) The first faction believed that al- `Askari had died and that he had held the Imamate by the testament of his father. Since the Imamate can only pass to the eldest living son of the former Imam, the Imamate passed from `Ali al-Hadi not to his eldest son Muhammad, who had died before him, but to al-`Askari, who was the elder of the two sons who had outlived their father.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This faction believed that al-`Askari had not left a publicly acknowledged son to take over the Imamate and, therefore, his sole remaining brother, Ja`far, was the Imam. In order to support their dogma they were obliged to repeat the Fatahiyyah&#8217;s arguments about the Imamate. The latter claimed that Musa al-Kadhim received the Imamate, not from his father Ja`far al-Sadiq, but from his eldest brother `Abd Allah, according to the tradition which says that the Imamate passes on to the eldest son of the Imam when he dies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the Fathiyya, this faction of the Ja`farites accepted the authenticity of the tradition which says that the Imamate will not fall to two brothers after al-Hasan and al-Husayn. But they maintained that this could only be applied if al-`Askari had left a son. Since al-`Askari had passed away without leaving a publicly acknowledged successor, his brother Ja`far was the designated Imam and the Imamate would pass on in his offspring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also recognized `Abd Allah bin Ja`far al-Sadiq as the seventh Imam. Consequently Ja`far was thirteenth in the chain of Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ii) The second faction of the Ja`farites contended that the eleventh Imam had himself designated Ja`far as his successor according to the principle of al-Bada&#8217;. The same thing had happened in the case of Isma`il, the eldest son of Imam Ja`far al­Sadiq. God had clarified His ultimate decision concerning him by taking away his soul and placing his brothers `Abd Allah and Musa consecutively in the Imamate instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, in the case of Ja`far bin `Ali, God had entrusted al-`Askari with the Imamate, but thereafter He had made it clear that the Imamate should not pass on in the progeny of al-`Askari. Therefore He transferred it to his brother Ja`far, who was the Imam after al-`Askari&#8217;s death. Like the previous factions, this faction used the argument and dogma of the Fatahiyyah to support their viewpoint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sect was probably more popular than the first among the theologians, especially in Kufah. Its leader was a Kufi theologian called `Ali bin Tahl or al-Talhi al-Khazzaz, who had been famous amongst the surviving members of the Fatahiyyah for his skill in theological discussions. He upheld Ja`far&#8217;s Imamate and encouraged people to take his side. He was supported in his propaganda by the sister of Faris bin Hatim bin Mahawiyyah al-Qazwini, although she rejected the Imamate of al- `Askari and claimed that the Imamate had been transferred to Ja`far from his father, `Ali al-Hadi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She may have had this claim because her brother, Faris bin Hatim, was killed on the order of al- `Askari. It is also possible that the Kufan scholastic family Banu Faddal, who were active supporters of the Fatahiyyah, adopted the doctrine of this faction, especially Ahmad bin al-Hasan bin `Ali bin Muhammad bin Faddal, who died in 260/874, and his brother `Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iii) The members of this faction claimed that the Imamate had passed on to Ja`far through the designation of his father. They based their doctrine on a tradition attributed to Ja`far al-Sadiq, which states that the Imamate cannot be held by two brothers after al-Hasan and al-Husayn. Since Muhammad, the eldest son of `Ali al-Hadi, died during the lifetime of his father, and since the Imamate should belong to those who survive the death of their father, it had not been transferred to Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They may have accepted the Imamate of al-`Askari because he was the eldest son after the death of his father, but they rejected his Imamate after his death, because he had passed away without leaving a publicly acknowledged son as his successor. It was a matter of course to them, they said, that the Imam could not die without leaving a publicly acknowledged and well­ known successor, designated by him and entrusted with the Imamate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore the claim of al-`Askari to the Imamate must be invalid. So it was inevitable that the Imam was Ja`far, by the designation of his father.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is worth mentioning that this faction existed within the lifetime of al- `Askari. When the tenth Imam died in 254/868 the majority of his followers accepted the Imamate of his eldest surviving son, al­`Askari, as confirmed by the testament of his father, but a minority took Ja`far&#8217;s side. He became more powerful after al- `Askari&#8217;s death, since some of al- `Askari&#8217;s adherents abandoned his Imamate and accepted that of Ja`far. A leading scholar of this faction was `Ali bin Ahmad bin Bashshar, who wrote a book on the Ghaybah and disputed fiercely with his opponents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is some evidence that this faction achieved a certain degree of success by persuading a few of the people who had accepted al- `Askari&#8217;s Imamate to join their side. Al-Saduq and al-Majlisi report a letter attributed to the Twelfth Imam, and sent to his agent, `Uthman bin Sa`id al-`Umari. This letter reveals that an adherent of this faction argued with a Twelver called al-Mukhtar, and succeeded in making him accept the Imamate of Ja`far. The sister of Faris bin Hatim, who was mentioned above, was one of the partisans of this group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iv) The followers of this faction were called al-Nafisiyyah. They believed that the tenth Imam had designated his eldest son Muhammad as his legatee. Then, according to the principle of Bada&#8217;, Allah took away his life while his father was still alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But when Muhammad bin `Ali passed away, by the order of his father, he designated his brother Ja`far as his successor. He entrusted his testament, the books, the secret knowledge and the weapons needed by the community to his trustworthy young slave called Nafis. And he ordered him to hand them over to his brother Ja`far when his father died.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when Muhammad died, the adherents of al-`Askari discovered the secret arrangement and the role of Nafis. Since Nafis was afraid of them and feared that the Imamate might be cut short, he called Ja`far and handed over the trust of Muhammad bin `Ali al­ Hadi. Ja`far himself claimed that the Imamate had been passed to him from his brother, Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The members of this faction denied the testament of al-Hasan al-`Askari, because his father, they claimed, had neither designated him nor changed his testament from Muhammad. Nafis was killed by being drowned in a well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schism III: The Muhammadiyyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sect denied the Imamate of Ja`far and al-`Askari and considered Muhammad, who had died in the lifetime of his father, as their Imam. They argued that `Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, had neither designated nor indicated either al-`Askari or Ja`far as his legatee. Therefore neither of them had any right to make claims upon the Imamate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the Imam could not die without leaving a successor, and since al-`Askari had passed away and not left a publicly acknowledged or well-known son, his Imamate was invalidated. Ja`far, they added, was not worthy of putting forward a claim because his immorality and sinfulness were infamous. His wicked character could not be prudent fear (Taqiyyah) in the face of his enemies, for Taqiyyah cannot be practiced by committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They concluded that since it was forbidden for the Imamate to be nullified, they were obliged to return to the Imamate of Muhammad bin `Ali, since he had left offspring and his acts were distinguished by probity and virtue. Others of them even considered him as al-Qa’im al-Mahdi and some of them went as far as to deny his death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schism IV: The Qat`iyyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This faction constituted the greater portion of the Imamiyyah. They believed that al-`Askari had died and left a son to succeed him, but they differed about the day of his birth, his name, and whether or not he was al-Qa’im al-Mahdi. For this reason they split into six groups:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i) The first group maintained that al- `Askari had died and left a son called Muhammad. According to Sa`d al-Qummi, they held that his son had come of age, while, according to al-Nawbakhti and al-Shahristani, they believed that he had been born two years before his father&#8217;s death. He was the Imam because his father had designated him so, and because it was well-known that al- `Askari had left no other son. So inevitably he was the Imam and al-Qa’im.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But due to fear of his uncle, Ja`far, he went into concealment and this became one of his occultations. This group built their doctrine on a tradition attributed to Ja`far al-Sadiq, which says that al-Qa’im&#8217;s date of birth is hidden from the people, information concerning him is obscure, and the people cannot know him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately little is known about this faction, but al-Saduq, while trying to prove the birth of the Twelfth Imam, mentions traditions which are presumably attributed to this faction&#8217;s adherents. One of these was called Ya&#8217;qub bin Manfush, who claimed that he had visited al-`Askari and asked him about his successor. Al-`Askari showed him his son, who was between eight and ten years old, indicating that his son would succeed him. Another was called Daw&#8217; bin Ali al-`Ijli, who maintained that he had met al-`Askari in his house where he saw his son, who was then two years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ii) The members of this group held the same dogma as the previous faction. They agreed with them on the death of al- `Askari, but they thought that he had left a successor whose name was not Muhammad but &#8216;Ali. They said that al-`Askari had no son except &#8216;Ali, who had been seen by his father&#8217;s trustworthy followers. According to Sa`d al-Qummi this sect had few adherents and they were concentrated within the suburbs (the Sawad) of Kufah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iii) This sect held that the Imam after al-`Askari was his son, who had been born eight months after his father&#8217;s death and had then gone into concealment. They argued that those who claimed that a son was born to him during his lifetime were making false statements, because al- `Askari had died without leaving a publicly acknowledged son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the pregnancy had been known to the caliph as well as other people, and for this reason the caliph delayed dividing his share in the state until the pregnancy was proved invalid. In fact, they said, the son was born eight months after the death of his father and was ridden, and his father had ordered that he be called Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They based their doctrine on a tradition attributed to the eighth main, `Ali bin Musa al-Riďa, which says, &#8220;You would test the fetus which is within the womb of his mother, and the suckling child.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iv) The partisans of this faction held that al-`Askari had no sons at all. The arguments about a hidden son, who was born during the lifetime of al- `Askari, were rejected by them, because they had searched for him during the life of the eleventh Imam using various means, but had failed to find him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But since the Imam cannot die without leaving an heir, they claimed that a slave girl had conceived a child belonging to al- `Askari, and that when she gave birth to him he would be the Imam, even if, as they are reported to have said by al-Mufid, the pregnancy should last a hundred years. They established their doctrine on a tradition of al-Sadiq, which states that al-Qa’im is he whose conception and date of birth are hidden from the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">v) This faction held that the Imam after al- `Askari was his son Muhammad, who was the Awaited One (al-Muntazar). They claimed that he had died but would rise to life with the sword to fill the earth with peace and justice after it had been filled with tyranny and injustice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This group is mentioned neither by Sa`d al-Qummi nor by al-Nawbakhti. Presumably the latter dealt with it but this discussion was later dropped from his work, since al-Mufid who based his information on al-Nawbakhti&#8217;s work, mentions this group in al­`Uyun wal-Mahasin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">vi) This group, entitled the Imamiyyah by Sa`d al-Qummi and al-Nawbakhti, held that al- `Askari had died and that inevitably Allah&#8217;s Hujjah (proof) on earth was his son. He was his sole successor and legatee, charged with the affairs of the Imamate after him in accordance with the method laid down by previous tradition. Thus the Imamate should pass on to his offspring until the Day of Resurrection, but he was absent and hidden by an order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was prohibited to seek him out before he chose to manifest himself, because his adherents would endanger his life and their own if they looked for him. In spite of his occultation a few reliable followers could contact him. He was born on 15th Sha&#8217;ban 256/29th July 868.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically this group directed their arguments against those factions which supported the Imamate of Muhammad and Ja`far. With the partisans of Muhammad they argued that the Imamate could be held neither by the descendants of Muhammad, who had died during his father&#8217;s lifetime, nor by his legatee, such as his brother or someone else, because there was no evidence or proof for accepting the Imamate of a son who had died before his father. Perhaps this argument was also directed against the Nafisiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Presumably with the Ja`farites they argued that the Imamate could not pass from brother to brother after al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and that the Imamate should fall to the eldest son of the preceding Imam. The eleventh Imam al- `Askari, was designated by the testament of his father, so the Imamate had to pass to his offspring. They also said that it was improper for the faithful to select an Imam for themselves. Allah had to choose him and to manifest him at the proper time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This faction constituted the majority of the Imamiyyah who had accepted the Imamate of al- `Askari, such as Abu Sahl Isma`il bin `Ali al-Nawbakhti, al-Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti, Sa`d bin `Abd Allah al-Ash`ari al-Qummi (the author of Kitab al-Maqalat wal-Firaq), `Uthman bin Sa`id al- `Umari and his son Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schism V: The Cessation of the Imamate</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This group held that from the moment al-`Askari died there was no longer an Imam. Al-Nawbakhti, al-Mufid and al-Shahristani considered this group as one faction, whereas Sa`d al-Qummi was presumably more accurate when he divided it into two, since the partisans of this schism agreed on the death of al-`Askari and the cessation of the Imamate, while they differed on the dogma of al-Qa’im al-Mahdi as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i) The first group deemed that it had been confirmed by successive transmission that al-`Askari would die without leaving a successor. For this reason there was no Imam after al-`Askari and the Imamate ceased. This, they contended, was reasonable and permitted. Since the cessation of the prophecy after Muhammad was possible, the cessation of the Imamate was also possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They established their doctrine on a transmission attributed to the sixth Imam, Ja`far al-Sadiq, which states that the earth cannot be without a Proof unless Allah becomes angry at the sins of His creatures and retains him from them for as long as He wills. This group did not believe in the rising of al-Qa’im al-Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ii) The people of the second group held the same doctrine as the previous faction, but they separated from them over the dogma of al-Qa’im al-Mahdi They said that since al-`Askari had passed away without leaving a successor, the Imamate had ceased until Allah raised the Qa&#8217;im from among the Imams who had died, such as al-Hasan al- `Askari, or from among any of his descendants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore the rising of al-Qa’im al-Mahdi was inevitable because this was confirmed by successive tradition. They considered the period after the death of al- `Askari and the rise of al-Qa’im as an interval of time devoid of prophecy and Imamate, like the period between Jesus and Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is some evidence that many people from various countries doubted the existence of the Twelfth Imam, such as Muhammad bin Ali bin Mahzayar al-Ahwazi from al-Ahwaz, and many of the persons from Banu Talib in Medina who had been agents of the eleventh Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This historical and theological survey suggests that on the death of al- `Askari, the Imamiyyah fell into problems similar to those which had beset them after the death of the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim. They split into al-Waqifah, Muhammadiyyah, Ja`fariyyah and Qat`iyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(…etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, as al-Mufid and al-Tusi state, all these divisions and splits gradually vanished, except for the Qat`iyyah, who became the Twelvers in the fourth/tenth century.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-What really happened after the death of the 11<sup>th</sup> Imam?-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to find out what really happened from a historical perspective, aside from the fairy tales and mythical stories invented by the various competing Shia sects, we must turn to the books written by reliable scholars and expert historians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote the leader of the Mu`tazillah al-Qadi `Abdul-Jabbar who quotes from the head of Mu`tazillah aba al-Qasim al-Balkhi [d.329AH]</p>
<p>[He said: And al-Hasan bin `Ali (al-`Askari) died in my time and left behind no children, so they (i.e his followers) became confused.] (Kitab-ul-Imamah min Al-Mughni)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote Imam `Ali bin Ahmad ibn Hazm al-Dhahiri [d.456AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then al-Hasan (al-`Askari) died without leaving behind any descendants, so they (The Shia) split into groups and most believed that al-Hasan had a son whom he had concealed, it was also said that he was born after al-Hasan’s death from a female servant of his called Saqil and this is the most popular story, others said from a servant called Narjis and others said from a servant called Sawsan but what is most apparent in their view is that she was Saqil. This woman called Saqil had claimed pregnancy after the death of her master al-Hasan bin `Ali and this was why his inheritance was frozen for seven years. Ja`far bin `Ali who was al-Hasan’s brother had disputes with her regarding this inheritance so a group of men from the government sided with her staunchly while others sided with Ja`far. Finally, it was revealed that there was no pregnancy and Ja`far acquired his brother’s inheritance; al-Hasan had died in the year two hundred and sixty. Meanwhile, the fanaticism of the Rafidah towards this Saqil and her claims increased so much that (the Caliph) al-Mu`tadid had to imprison her after around twenty years from her masters’ death; she was then found in the house of al-Hasan bin Ja`far al-Nawbakhti the writer so they carried her to the castle of al-Mu`tadid where she remained until she died in (Caliph) al-Muqtadir’s time. They (the Shia) have been waiting for this person since more than a hundred and eighty years.] (Al-Fasl fil-Milal Ibn Hazm)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, as the reader can already tell from all the above, it’s very clear that the 11<sup>th</sup> Imam had no children, this in turn led his followers to differ among themselves and divide to many sects which in itself shows that the man had no successor for if he did, then there is no sound explanation for all the chaos above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of al-`Askari’s followers denied his Imamah after they saw that he left no heir while others jumped from him to his brothers Ja`far and Muhammad since they had no choice. The majority were in a very tough spot as they already narrated many reports claiming the man was a legitimate Imam so they couldn’t go back on their words or their necks and livelihoods were on the line, so they decided to tell people that he did in fact have a son and they spread this and they differed on almost every aspect of this son’s existence because they didn’t plan their lies carefully, they would use excuses that his father showed him to only a select few individuals and then hid him from the public eye out of fear for him or that his mother didn’t appear pregnant since Imams are born from the thighs of their mothers not their wombs or that the Imam can grow in one day like an average human grows in one week and that’s how he was able to escape and go into hiding or that he had now disappeared completely but still sends them letters from an unknown location and only one man can communicate with him as an emissary or that his existence must remain a secret and so nobody must utter his name in public or even in written form and the narrations are famous so refer back to the books of the folks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above-mentioned group of lunatics is what exists today as “Twelver Shia”, but the reality of the matter is that the man passed without a known heir and what the previous team said was nothing but a claim. The followers of al-`Askari wished to retrieve the fortunes that their deceased Imam received in his life from the naïve Shia, they feared that since he passed away then his inheritance would go to their enemy Ja`far bin `Ali al-`Askari whom they had branded as an immoral liar. Allah knows best whether Ja`far was in reality as they claimed or if he was an upright pious man who suffered a campaign of defamation by rival Shia gangs who opposed his Imamah for it is a known habit of the Shia to try and raise the status of their Imams by insulting others. It also seems that some of the heads of the Shia thought that the best way to prevent this was to claim that al-Hasan had a son who happened to be in his mother’s womb and that one of his father’s female servants was pregnant with him. Knowing how wealthy al-`Askari was he must have had quite a few female servants and so these Shia differed on which one was the mother, some said Narjis, some said Rayhanah and others said Sawsan as well as many others. One of these women called Saqil, -apparently a Nubian slave girl from Africa- she became greedy for her master’s wealth and so she stepped up and openly claimed to be the divine savior’s mother and she was backed by some of the most prominent Shia clerics and figure-heads. However, Ja`far wasn’t going to remain silent and watch his rightful inheritance be stolen by a band of thugs, so he disputed with them and fought them for it until the matter reached the ears of the Sultan. The Sultan then sent expert women to verify whether Saqil was truly pregnant and they exposed her for the liar that she was and Ja`far acquired his right. The Shia are popular for being a stubborn bunch and they never admit their misguidance so even after all of this they kept sanctifying Saqil for twenty years and claiming that she was the hidden Imam’s mother and they became so great in number that the Sultan became cautious so he called for her and they found her hidden in the house of one of the men of Nawbakht, then she was arrested in the palace until her death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next we quote Imam abu al-`Abbas ibn Tayymiyyah al-Harrani [d.728AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We say: It was stated by Imam abu al-Husayn `Abdul-Baqi bin Qani` [d.351AH] and Imam abu Ja`far Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari [d.310AH] as well as others from the scholars of history and genealogy that al-Hasan bin `Ali al-`Askari had no descendants or children. As for the Imamiyyah who claim that he had a son who entered the cellar while still a child, some of them said: “He was two years old” others said: “He was three” and some said: “He was five”, I say: If this character was in fact present and known, then according to Allah’s laws which were established in the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus, he should be placed under the guardianship of whoever can take care of him such as his mother or his grandmother, and his wealth must be placed under the responsibility of the executor of his father’s will, a near relative or a representative of the Sultan, this is because he is an orphan that lost his father and Allah says: {Test well the orphans, until they reach the age of marrying; then, if you perceive in them right judgment, deliver to them their property; consume it not wastefully and hastily ere they are grown. If any man is rich, let him be abstinent; if poor, let him consume in reason. And when you deliver to them their property, take witnesses over them; God suffices for a reckoner.} [4:6] One cannot hand to this child his money until he reaches the age of marriage and maturity as Allah declared, so how then can a person who can’t be responsible for his own body and property be the leader of all Muslims, immune to error and that the one who denies him is a disbeliever!? Then by their own consensus whether he happened to exist or not, then they do not benefit anything from him in their world or religion, nor did he teach anyone anything and we do not know of a good deed that he accomplished or a bad one, nor did we achieve through him any of the benefits of leadership, or its goals in general. On the contrary, if this character happens to actually exist then his existence is only a cause of harm for the people of the earth, this is because those who insist on believing in him have not benefitted from his grace nor did they fulfill their interests with his aid, while those who deny him will be punished and tortured on the day of judgment according to them. Therefore, he is pure evil, there is no goodness in him whatsoever and this kind of creature cannot be the work of the all-wise God of justice. If they say: “He concealed himself from the people only because of their oppression.” We say: This oppression was also there in the time of his fathers but they never went into occultation (etc…)] (Al-Minhaj Ibn Taymiyyah)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next we quote Imam Shams-ul-Din Muhammad al-Dhahabi [d.748AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He is the seal of the twelve masters who are said to be infallible by the Imamiyyah -Nobody is infallible except a prophet- This individual called Muhammad is the one they claim is the successor, the divine proof, the owner of the time, the one who entered the cellar in Samarra’ and that he is alive and never dies until he appears and fills the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression. By Allah, we wish this was true but they’ve been waiting for four-hundred and seventy years and the truth is that whoever refers you to an absent leader did not do you justice let alone a non-existent leader! (etc…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Mawla, Imam `Ali: He is from the rightly guided Caliphs, he has been guaranteed heaven may Allah be pleased with him, we love him deeply but we do not claim his infallibility just as we do not claim it for Abu Bakr al-Siddiq.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His sons, Hasan and Husayn: They are the Sibtayn of Rasul-Allah (saw), the masters of the youth of paradise, they are worthy of being Caliphs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zayn-ul-`Abidin: Of great repute, from the heads of the pious scholars, worthy of leadership, there were those of his level in his time and they exceeded him in issuing verdicts and narrating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His son abu Ja`far al-Baqir: A master, a religious leader, a jurist worthy of Caliphate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His son Ja`far al-Sadiq: Of high status, from the heads of knowledge, he was more deserving of Caliphate than abu Ja`far al-Mansour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His son Musa: Had big status and descent knowledge, more deserving of Caliphate than Haroun, in his time he had equals in virtue and merit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His son `Ali: Of high status, he had knowledge and understanding, he was also charismatic, al-Ma’moun made him heir to his throne due to his honor but he died in the year two-hundred and three.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His son Muhammad: From the masters of his people, he did not reach his fathers’ level of knowledge and jusrisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same can be said about his son al-Hadi: A venerated man of honorable descent and so was his son al-Hasan al-`Askari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for this Muhammad (etc…) They claimed he entered a cellar in his father’s house while his mother looked at him and never came out until this hour and he was seven or less as was said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Qadi Ibn Khallikan [d.681AH] stated: “It was said: Rather, he entered while he was seventeen in the year two-hundred seventy five. It was also said: Rather, in the year (two-hunded) sixty five and that he is alive.” We seek refuge in Allah from foolishness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s propose for the sake of the argument that this myth took place then, (we ask) who saw him? Who do we rely on to inform us of his life? Who informed us of his infallibility and vast knowledge? This is clear deviance that causes confusion and misguidance (…etc…) And from those who declared that al-Hasan al-`Askari died without children were Imam abu Ja`far Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari [d.310AH] and Imam abu Muhammad Yahya bin Sa`id al-Hashimi [d.318AH] and they are both sufficient for you in knowledge and reliability.] (Al-Siyar al-Dhahabi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next we quote al-Imam Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah [d.751AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the Imami Rafidah they have a fourth opinion: They say that the Mahdi is Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-`Askari the awaited one, from the children of al-Husayn not al-Hasan and that he is present in the lands but hidden from the sight. He entered the cellar in Samarra’ when he was a small child more than five-hundred years ago and was never seen or heard of again. They await his return daily as they place horses on the entrance of the cellar and yell to him: “Come out our leader! Come out!” then they return in disappointment and this is their habit so as the poet says: “Is it not yet the time that this cellar gives birth to the one you speak of O ignorant &#8212; Nay, your brains are excused since you believe in the (holy trinity) of the ghoul, the phoenix (and the hidden Imam).” These folks (the Rafidah) have become a disgrace upon humanity and a laughing-stock for men of understanding.] (Al-Manar-ul-Munif Ibn al-Qayyim)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next we quote al-Imam abu al-Fida’ Isma`il bin `Umar bin Kathir [d.774AH]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Regarding the narration of the twelve leaders who are all from Quraysh, they are not the same twelve claimed by the Rafidah, as those last ones did not acquire authority over the people except for `Ali and his son al-Hasan. The last of them as they (the Rafidah) claim is the awaited Mahdi in the cellar of Samarra’ and he does not exist nor did any eye witness him nor is there any trace.] (Al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah Ibn Kathir)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-Listing his name in the books of genealogy-</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One may ask at the end of all this, if this matter is so clear as we’ve seen above, then how-come we find in several books of genealogy, such as “`Umadat-ul-Talib” by the Zaydi Shia Ibn `Inabah [d.828AH] or “Ansab-ul-Talibiyin” by Husayn bin `Abdullah al-Samarqandi [d.1043AH] we find in such books that al-Hasan al-`Askari had a son or even more than one son and daughter as opposed to what was mentioned above and some books may include a physical description of him which is odd since nobody has supposedly seen him nor are they supposed to mention his name according to their authentic narrations let alone describe his features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will mention a few samples of this below,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Zaydi Shia scholar Jamal-ul-Din ibn `Inabah [d.828AH] mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He had descendants from two of his sons, they are: abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-`Askari who is the twelfth one for them (For the Imami Shia), he had great knowledge and piety, his mother is Umm Walad, he is the father of Muhammad al-Mahdi who is al-Qa’im al-Muntazar according to the Imamiyyah, he is born of a female servant called Narjis or another as was said.] (Al-`Umdah Ibn `Inabah)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shafi`i scholar Abu al-`Abbas Shihab-ul-Din al-Qalqashandi [d.821AH] mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Ja`afirah(Ja`farites): A lineage from the children of al-Husayn al-Sabt from banu Hashim of the `Adnanites, they are the children of Ja`far al-Sadiq bin Muhammad al-Baqir bin `Ali Zayn-ul-`Abidin bin al-Husayn al-Sabt. As for al-Husayn his lineage will be mentioned under the letter “Alif” and “Al-Lam ma` al-Ha’”, as for Ja`far then he is from the twelve leaders according to the Ithna-`Ashariyyah(Twelvers), they are Amir-ul-Mu’minin `Ali ibn abi Talib, then his son al-Hasan al-Sabt, then his brother al-Husayn al-Sabt, then his son `Ali Zayn-ul-`Abidin, (…etc…) then his son al-Hasan al-`Askari, then his son Muhammad al-Mahdi who is the twelfth one, and they (the Shia) believe he is alive and await his appearance] (Nihayat-ul-Irab fi Ansab-ul-`Arab Al-Qalqashandi)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shafi`i scholar Abu al-`Abbas ibn Khallikan Al-Irbili [d.681AH] mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, son of al-Hasan al-`Askari son of `Ali al-Hadi son of Muhammad al-Jawad who was previously mentioned, the twelfth of the twelve leaders in the belief of the Imamiyyah, known as al-Hujjah, he is the one whom the Shia claim is the awaited Qa’im and Mahdi, he is also the one who is from the cellar according to them and they (the Shia) have many stories about him, they await his reappearance at the end of times from that cellar in Surra-man-Ra’a. His birth was on Friday, the middle of Sha`ban in 255 hijri, when his father died he was five years of age, his mother’s name is Khamt, it was also said Narjis. The Shia say: He entered the cellar in his father’s house while his mother looked at him and never returned to her, this was in 265 hijri while he was nine. Ibn al-Azraq had mentioned in his history book that this Hujjah whom we speak of was born on the ninth of Rabi`-ul-Awwal in the year 258 hijri, and it was said: the eight of Sha`ban in the year 256 hijri and that is more correct, and that when he entered the cellar he was four, it was also said: five, and it was said: he entered in the year 275 hijri while he was seventeen. Allah knows best what’s true from among this and may Allah have mercy on him.] (Wafiyat-ul-A`iyan Ibn Khallikan)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice that the scholar above is a known man from Ahlul-Sunnah, yet he mentions Muhammad in the children of al-`Askari. In other words he mentions it although he doesn’t really believe this individual was al-Mahdi nor does he believe his parents were divine Imams, similarly he mentions a couple of other so called Mahdies in his book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dear readers is because the books of genealogy -or books of “Ansab” as they are known- are more like story books, these types of books are usually the most unreliable of books unlike books of Hadith or books of `Aqidah or Fiqh. The authors will record all that was mentioned historically about every personality they list out of academic integrity, in our case since a group of people claimed that al-Hasan had a son who disappeared, the scholars will mention this son, they will also mention his titles and Kuniyah in addition to any dates of birth or death they come across. Notice the scholar above for instance said “May Allah have mercy on him” meaning that if he did in fact have this son then he is most likely dead in that so called cellar. The example of this is similar to the books that document Hadith narrators, otherwise known as books of “Rijal”, these books will list what is known about the narrators of prophetic-traditions yet some of these narrators are completely unknown, some are in fact fictional characters, yet the scholars still include them in their compilations since they were previously mentioned as parts of certain chains or events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We leave the conclusions for the intelligent readers and peace be upon our Prophet and master Muhammad ibn `Abdillah and his Family and Companions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon this nation and its Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this fifteenth part, we will discuss the matter of the young age of the 12th Imam when he received authority and was supposed to lead all of humanity. By doing so we will be refuting Shiite preachers like al-Mufid and al-Murtada who are known for using lame excuses to argue against their opponents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s Shia believe that their current leader was a five year old boy. As far as this sect being one that claims &#8220;Lutf&#8221; or divine grace, they fail miserably in this case since if this concept was indeed existent then Allah would only allow a capable mature man to lead humanity. This is for a simple reason, which is that the human intellect will reject the idea of a small kid being the leader of all humanity, since kids are not wise, they aren&#8217;t intelligent, they are not physically able to bear the burdens of the message and they are completely unreliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, if a five year old came to you and claimed he was the divine leader of humanity and the best human alive (as that is from the conditions of Imamah according to them), any normal person would smile at the kid and walk away, this of course means that God&#8217;s plan would not be fulfilled and the guidance would not reach anybody nor would they benefit from this divine leader. This contradicts &#8220;lutf&#8221; because God knows that men will never be convinced that God would choose a small kid as divine leader and thus they would be much less likely to believe in him than if he was an old man. This is similar to God appointing a famous liar to be a divine leader, that would contradict &#8220;Lutf&#8221; as God knows that men aren&#8217;t going to follow his teachings and guidance since the chosen one was popular for his lies and trickery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Twelvers believe in this ridiculous hidden five year old&#8217;s divine leadership, they sought to justify it. They searched for precedents of young boys being appointed as Prophets in past nations and they stumbled upon Sulayman, `Isa and Yahya peace be upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will look into these stories and see if there are any similarities and we will rely on the most popular Islamic source when it comes to stories of the Prophets which is &#8220;Qasas-ul-Anbiya'&#8221; by al-Hafidh Ibn Kathir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sulayman bin Dawoud (as):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>{And Sulayman inherited Dawoud. He said, &#8220;O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty.&#8221; &#8211; And gathered for Solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows.} [27:16-17]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Sulayman (as) was at his father&#8217;s funeral, in the presence of thousands of his subjects from farmers and religious men and soldiers, he ordered the birds to shade his father and the people in attendance from the sun and so the sky was covered with birds. Sulayman (as) was only one of Dawoud&#8217;s (as) many children, but he was a chosen prophet and he was his father&#8217;s heir as was popular to all and nobody competed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">We notice that there is no relation between this story and that of the 12th Shiite Imam. Slayman (as) was made king after his father passed and he had pointed to him during his life and his kingdom was vast and his matter was known. Sulayman (as) was a prophet of God, he had signs and miracles and the people followed him after his father Dawoud (as).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Was Sulayman&#8217;s (as) birth secret? No. Was the child hidden by his father out of fear for him? No. Did the child go into occultation at the age of five? No. Did God expect Dawoud&#8217;s (as) people to believe that he had a secret hidden son that nobody saw or heard of nor did anyone observe his mother&#8217;s pregnancy? No. Then it goes without saying that God would not expect from them to believe that this little hidden child is their leader and the divine ruler of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">`Isa bin Mariyam (as):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>{So she pointed to him. They said, &#8220;How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?&#8221; &#8211; [`Isa] said, &#8220;Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.&#8221;} [19:29-30]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Isa&#8217;s (as) story is famous, he was born without a father and when he was born the idols of the pagans were all crushed and demolished miraculously, and then his mother brought him publicly in front of her people and Allah granted him the miracle of speech in a way that no intelligent man had any doubts about his prophet-hood except a stubborn disbeliever. Then as an adult he was known by the tribes in those lands and he performed miracles and revived the dead by Allah&#8217;s command and he was a prophet of guidance for his people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Isa (as) only feared his Lord and he fulfilled his mission and finally when faced with his enemies and certain death, Allah raised him and protected him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We notice that there is no relation between this story and that of the 12th Shiite Imam. `Isa&#8217;s (as) prophet-hood was popular and public and he was not hidden, and Allah does not expect the people to believe that a young child can be a prophet or guide so He blessed him with miracles so that nobody may deny his status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did Mariyam (as) hide the fact that she had a baby? No. Did she hide the baby after he was born? No. Did the secret baby then go into occultation and disappear from his people completely without a trace after his mother&#8217;s death? No. Did Allah expect the people to take her word seriously when she claimed she had a baby of divine origins? No, Allah made sure to make the matter known and popular through miracles and signs so that no one may deny and `Isa (as) was popular among his people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Yahya bin Zakariya (as):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>{[Allah] said, &#8220;O Yahya, take the Scripture with determination.&#8221; And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy} [19:12]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prophet Zakariya (as) when he reached old age wished for a son to succeed him in prophet-hood and continue his mission after his death. Allah then told Yahya (as) when he was at the age of youth to adhere to the book of Musa (as), the Torah, and to follow its teachings. Allah then bestowed upon Yahya (as) a good understanding of those scriptures and blessed him with wisdom. Yahya (as) was the only sinless human, he committed no sins by Allah&#8217;s will and through His protection and this was a miracle that was exclusive to him. Yahya (as) and `Isa (as) were cousins, and `Isa (as) would ask Yahya (as) for advice and benefit from him and their mothers were pregnant with them at the same time. Yahya (as) was also known as the most beautiful man of his time, so when the woman of the king of that land tried to seduce him, he refused and so she ordered his execution. The men came to him as he prayed alongside his father Zakariya (as) and they took him and murdered him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We notice that there is no relation between this story and that of the 12th Shiite Imam. Here we have a prophet of God, who asked God to bless him with a son, so God blessed him with a son who was a prophet, the son was pious and wise at a young age and he accompanied his father as he grew and aided him until he was murdered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did Yahya (as) have a secret birth? No. Did Zakariya (as) hide his son so that no one may know of him? No. Did Yahya (as) disappear in his childhood and never be heard from again? No. As opposed to this, Yahya&#8217;s (as) prophet-hood was public and he was popular among his people for his wisdom and piety and he never went into any form of occultation even when faced with the danger of death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Were the people required to believe that Yahya (as) was the leader of humanity at the age of five? The answer is No, rather he was a young blessed boy who helped his father until he later died in his father&#8217;s life and none of the pious believers had any confusion regarding his divine mission or prophet-hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did God order the people to believe in a hidden boy and accept him as their divine leader, a child they never met, a child they never saw any signs from, a child who was concealed from them constantly and they could not derive any benefit from him in their worldly or religious affairs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly Not!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(PS. notice how Shia scream that it&#8217;s unwise for the Prophet (saw) to entrust the matter of leadership after him to his trusted Companions and disciples so they may pick a qualified man from among them who pleases Allah, yet they don&#8217;t find it unwise to leave the fate of the nation in the hands of a cowardly five year old kid.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah is the source of success and peace be upon our Prophet and his family and companions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main beliefs of Twelver Imami Shia sect is that their 12th Imam is the Mahdi. Throughout shia history, the identity of who is the Mahdi has caused many disputes &amp; controversies among Imami followers. Shias often split and follow different imams after the previous one has passed away. If there were instructions or wills written then how could these disputes arise so often?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those disputes were recorded in detail by a 3rd century shia scholar, al-Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti in his book Firaq al-Shia (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shia-Sects-Nawbakhti/dp/1904063268" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">link</a>). He is one of the foremost respected early Shia scholar. Famous Shia rijali scholar, al-Najashi described him as &#8220;Our Shaikh, the Mutakallim, who surpassed his contemporaries before the year 300H and thereafter&#8221; and he went on to list over 40 of al-Nawbakhti&#8217;s works. al-Tusi also praised al-Nawbakhti as a pious Imami.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us see whom the early shias believe were their true Mahdis:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Ali</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….Ali was not killed and he did not die. They said that he would not die until he had driven the Arabs with his cane and filled the earth with justice and fairness, after it has been filled with oppression and injustice. This was the first sect in Islam that believed in waqf (considering Ali the hidden imam), after the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his family. They were also the first extremists (Ghulat). They were called &#8220;the Saba’iyya&#8221;, the followers of Abdullah b. Saba’ who publicly criticised Abu Bakr, Umar…“ [page 67-68]<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>“…some scholars who were close to Ali peace be upon him said that <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/09/18/abdullah-ibn-saba-the-book/" rel="external nofollow">Abdullah bin Saba’</a> was a Jew before he converted to Islam…” [page 68]<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>“….he was the first to declare that the imamate of Ali (AS) was mandatory…” [page 69]<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>al-Nawbakhti mentioned that the first people to be known to hate Abu Bakr &amp; Umar RA were the followers of Abdullah bin Saba the Jew, the same person whose existence many Shias scholars &amp; writers of today try to deny. They believe Ali was Mahdi, not the 12th imam</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Muhammad bin al Hanafiyya</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….They said al Hasan bin Ali fought against Mu’awiyah with the permission of Muhammad and made the truce with his permission too. Al Husayn too, they said, fought Yazid with his permission, otherwise, both (al-Hasan &amp; al-Husayn) would be misguided and would perish, for anyone who opposes Muhammad b al-Hanafiyya is blasphemous&#8230;&#8221; [page 76]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Hasan &amp; Husein were the followers of the true imam, Muhammad al-Hanafiyah who was also Mahdi</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Abdullah bin Muhammad bin al Hanafiyya (Abu Hashim)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….he was called Abu Hashim and he was his father&#8217;s oldest son. His father designated him for succession….he was al Mahdi and that he did not die….” [page 80]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Muhammad al-Hanafiyah&#8217;s son, not Hasan nor Husein was the next imam &amp; also Mahdi</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Abdullah bin Mu’awiyah bin Abdullah bin Ja’far bin Abi Talib (appointed by Abu Hashim)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….Abdullah bin Mu’awiyah is al Mahdi, who was mentioned by the Prophet peace be upon him, and his family and that he will rule the world, filling it with fairness and justice after it has been filled with injustice and oppression. Then, when he dies, he will leave his place to a man from Bani Hashim – from the descendants of Ali bin Abi Talib….” [page 86]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Mahdi is from Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib&#8217;s lineage not Ali&#8217;s</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Muhammad bin Abdullah bin al Hasan (al-Muthanna) bin al Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib (known as an-Nafs az-Zakiya)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“When Abu Ja’far, peace be upon him died, his followers became 2 sects. One sect believed in the imamate of Muhammad bin Abdullah bin al Hasan bin al Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib who revolted in Madina and was killed there. They claimed that he was al Mahdi and that he was not killed….” [page 117]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Mahdi is from al-Hasan&#8217;s and not al-Husein&#8217;s lineage</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Ja’far al-Sadiq</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Ja’far bin Muhammad did not die and that he will not die until he revolts and rules the people and that he is al-Mahdi” [page 122]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Ja’far al-Sadiq was Mahdi, however it is very interesting to note that after his death the majority of Shia&#8217;s scholars &amp; respected figures believed in Abdullah, not Musa al-Kadhim as the next imam. After Abdullah died, they then followed Musa al-Kadhim (look up page 133). Why didn&#8217;t the majority of Shia scholars back then know that imam after Ja&#8217;far was Musa, instead Abdullah? Is it possible those scholars who were followers of a living imam didn&#8217;t know or maybe the 12 imam belief didn&#8217;t exist back then?</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Ismail bin Ja’far al-Sadiq</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….they denied the death of Ismail during his father&#8217;s life – saying that it was a trick plotted by his father, who was afraid for him, so he hid him. They claimed Ismail would not die until he ruled the world and cared for the people and that he was al-Mahdi, because his father appointed him for the imamate after him….” [page 123]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Ismail was the true imam and Mahdi (not Musa al-Kadhim)</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. Muhammad bin Ismail bin Ja’far al Sadiq</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“….There are only 7 imams after the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his family. These are Ali bin Abi Talib (who is an imam-prophet), al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Ali bin al-Husayn, Muhammad bin Ali (al-Baqir), Ja’far bin Muhammad, Muhammad bin Ismail bin Ja’far, who is al-Qaim al-Mahdi and he is a Prophet” [page 127]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>True imams were only 7 not 12. Muhammad bin Ismail was Mahdi and Prophet. <em>Note: Shia of today believe imams have higher status than most Prophets although stopped short of saying calling them prophets</em></strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. Musa al Kadhim</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Musa bin Ja’far did not die, nor will he die until he rules the world from east to west. He would fill it with justice after it had been filled with oppression. They claimed that he was al-Qaim al-Mahdi” [page 137] </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;al-Rida, peace be upon him and his successors were not imams, rather they were [Musa&#8217;s] deputies &#8211; one after another &#8211; until the time of his return&#8230;&#8221; [page 138]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Imamate ended with al-Kadhim and he was Mahdi and did not continue after him. Ali al-Ridha and all imams after him were only al-Kadhim&#8217;s deputies, not true imams</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10. Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Musa</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“When Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Musa al-Ridha, peace be upon him died, one sect of his followers believed in the imamate of his son, Muhammad, who died in Samarra (Surra Man Ra&#8217;a) during his father&#8217;s life&#8230;despite the appearance of his death, he did not really die&#8230;.and that he is al-Mahdi” [page 150-151]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>Ali al-Hadi/al-Naqi appointed Muhammad (who was made to appear to die during his father&#8217;s lifetime). He was Mahdi and the true imam, not Hasan al-Askari</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11. Hasan (al-Askari) bin Ali<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“His followers became fourteen 14 sects after his death. One sect said that al-Hasan bin Ali is alive, but he dissapeared and he is al-Mahdi, for it is impossible for him to die not leaving an acknowledged son….” [page 153]<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<strong>The 11th imam is Mahdi. This is one of the most confusing death as his followers were divided into many groups and this deserves a separate article as out of 14, only 4 believed he had a son</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see, the claim that shia imamate belief is as clear as the sun has been contradicted by this disputes as described by their own scholars. Imamate which shia said would prevent the ummah from misguidance, became the main cause for their misguidance and confusion for even their scholars during their imam&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are these not enough proofs for any sincere person to see how confused, misguided and baseless shia imamate beliefs are?!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entire point of the belief in Imamah for both Ahlul Sunnah and the Twelver Shias is the need of the Ummah for constant guidance. For Ahlul Sunnah an Imam is a scholar, a ruler, a leader of congregational prayers, e.t.c. For the Twelver Shias, Imamah is akin to Prophethood, in that Allah (swt) appointed 12 men, each succeeding the other, to lead and guide the Muslims after the death of the Prophet (saw).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Twelvers believe that the 12th Imam is in occultation. This belief in the occultation of their 12th Imam has presented them with problems since its inception. Since the point of an Imam is to lead and guide the Muslims, the Twelvers were faced with the problem of having to explain how a hidden and inaccessible Imam benefits anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Twelvers attempted to solve this problems in several ways, one of them being fabricated narrations such as the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">غير واحد ، عن محمد بن همام ، عن الفزاري ، عن الحسن بن محمد بن سماعة ، عن أحمد بن الحارث ، عن المفضل ، عن ابن ظبيان ، عن جابر الجعفي ن جابر الانصاري أنه سأل النبي صلى الله عليه واله هل ينتفع الشيعة بالقائم عليه السلام في غيبته ؟ فقال صلى الله عليه واله : إي والذي بعثني بالنبوة إنهم لينتفعون به ، ويستضيئون بنور ولايته في غيبته كانتفاع الناس بالشمس وإن جللها السحاب .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summary:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Jabir al-Ansari asked the Prophet (saw): How will the Shi&#8217;a benefit from the Qai&#8217;m (the one who arises) when he is in hiding? So the Prophet replied : I swear by the One who sent me with Prophethood that they will benefit. They shall be illuminated with the light of his Wilayah during his occultation, just as the people benefit from the sun when it is hidden by the clouds.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al-Anwar, volume 52, chapter 20, page number 92</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/lib-hadis/behar52/a10.html</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a popular explanation that Twelver Shias give when asked how the 12th Imam benefits them while in hiding. It is like the benefit that we receive when the sun is obscured on a cloudy day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Famous Twelver Shia scholar Allamah Muhammad Baqir Al-Majlisi attempts to explain this , and we quote some of his explanations below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">كما أن الشمس المحجوبة بالسحاب مع انتقاع الناس بها &#8211; ينتظرون في كل آن انكشاف السحاب عنها وظهورها ، ليكون انتفاعهم بها أكثر ، فكذلك في أيام غيبته عليه السلام ، ينتظر المخلصون من شيعته خروجه وظهوره ، في كل وقت و زمان ، ولا ييأسون منه .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When the sun is hidden behind the clouds, it continues to bring benefit to mankind. Nevertheless mankind continues to wait expectantly for it to reappear from behind the clouds so that they may benefit more from it. Similar is the state during the Imam&#8217;s concealment. The sincere ones from his partisans await his re-appearance all the time and in every epoch and do not give up hope in him. ]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أن منكر وجوده عليه السلام مع وفور ظهور آثاره كمنكر وجود الشمس إذا غيبها السحاب عن الابصار .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The denier of his existence despite the abundant proofs of his existence is like the denier of the existence of the sun when the clouds hide it from sight.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al-Anwar, volume 52, chapter 20, page number 92-93</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/lib-hadis/behar52/a10.html</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response to this we shall analyse this explanation from both a logical and scientific point of view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a logical point of view we say that the sun is apparent to everyone before it is obscured by clouds. None can deny it exists because they saw it before it was obscured, and the sun is visible to all the people on Earth for the majority of their lives, no two individuals differ on its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make an analogy with the 12th Imam, we would have to say that only 2-3 people ever saw the sun before it was completely hidden by clouds, these people contradicted each other as to how it was obscured, and it has been obscured permanently ever since.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because some Shiites will say he&#8217;s hidden because he fears being killed by his enemies. Others say: &#8220;No no, he is only hiding so that God may test our faith.&#8221; Others say: &#8220;No no, he is hiding because he doesn&#8217;t have true supporters.&#8221; Others say: &#8220;No no, he is hiding as a punishment for us from God because of our corruption.&#8221; and so on and so forth from endless excuses. As for the sun, nobody differs on why it is concealed by clouds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a scientific point of view we must ask – what would happen to the people if the sun were obscured by clouds for over 1,000 years?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We need to assume that the sun is completely obscured by clouds, and that no light is reaching through. This is because the 12th Imam of the Twelver Shias is also completely obscured from the people who never see him. With no (or minimal) light reaching through the clouds, the Earth becomes devoid of solar radiation which is essential for the generation of heat. A sort of new ice age would dawn, with massive ice sheets forming the world over, impeding navigation of the seas and destroying worldwide commerce and trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With no solar radiation to provide for photosynthesis, most plant matter would rapidly die. The people would have no grain to make bread, no fruits and vegetables. Animals dependent upon plants would die, and within the space of a few years, humanity would face a catastrophic food crises, leading to mass starvation and famine. The progression of civilisation as we know it would come to a crashing halt, and the extinction of the entirety of humanity would rapidly follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to conclude, we thank Allah (swt) that he did not afflict us with such a calamity, and that we have Imams that are visible and accessible to us, through whom we seek knowledge and guidance.</p>

</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon our nation and prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we will be discussing the Shia mythology (aka Hidden Imam), more specifically an event that shook Shiite society and sent them back into a state of confusion and &#8220;Hayrah&#8221; once again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Namely, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. From the Messenger of Allah (pbuhaf): Hijaz (Saudi Arabia) will be ruled by a man whose name is the name of an animal(Fahad/leopard), when you see him from a distance, you would think he has a lazy eye, and if you get close to him, you do not see anything (wrong) in his eyes. He will be succeeded by a brother of his, named Abdullah. Woe to our Shia (followers) from him! Woe to our Shia (followers) from him! Woe to our Shia (followers) from him! – he repeated it three times – Give me the good news of his death, and I shall give you the good news of the appearance of the hujjah (Imam Mahdi). Reference: Two Hundred and Fifty Signs, sign number 122</p>
<p>2. From Abi Baseer who heard from Imam Sadiq (pbuhaf): Whoever guarantees for me the death of Abdullah, I will guarantee for him the Qa’im (Imam Mahdi). When Abdullah dies, then people will not gather/agree on anyone after him, and this matter will not except for your companion (Imam Mahdi) inshallah, and the kingdom of years will be over, and it will become the kingdom of months and days. So I asked: Will that be prolonged? He said: No. (Biharul Anwar, Volume 52, page 21 &amp; Ghaybat-ul-Tusi)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These kinds of narrations above, are from the typical lies invented by Shia leaders to drug their followers and keep their hopes and expectations up as they await eternally for their so called hidden savior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you all know, Shia expected the emergence of their 12th leader after the death of the Saudi king Abdullah. They all awaited in anticipation, some even saved up money for when their Imam comes so they may go and meet him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">King Abdullah finally died in the 23rd of January 2015, which is the 3rd of the month of Rabi`-ul-Thani 1436 in the Hijri calendar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happened was simple: The King died and no hidden Imam appeared as opposed to Shia mythology, also there was no chaos and the authority was handed to his brother Salman who now rules Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we head to ShiaChat to check on the reactions of those folks, and give the readers a glimpse of the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the thread called: &#8220;If King Abdullah Is Dead, Why Hasnt Al Qaim Come?&#8221; Started by Ya Mahdi1999 , Feb 09 2015 03:27 AM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;Ya Mahdi1999&#8221; says: [[It has been over 2 weeks since King Abdullah died, why hasnt our beloved Imam arrived yet?????]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course this guy is disappointed, he should raise a complaint to his master Husayn (ra) and see maybe he can intercede and get the hidden guy to come out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia moderator &#8220;hameedeh&#8221; says: [[Imam Mahdi AJ would come in the month of Rajab? ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That sounds good, so now we&#8217;re in the Arabian month of Rabi`-ul-Thani, after it is Jumadah al-Awwal and Jumadah al-Thani, then comes Rajab. Two more months until this Shia lady discovers that there is no 12th Imam nor will he ever appear (And we will remind eachother).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apparently this silly comment above restored the faith of our Shi`ee brother &#8220;Ya Mahdi1999&#8221;, he replies by saying: [[Indeed, thanks for your answer, it has restored once again the patience in awaiting our saviour]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed Shi`ee faith is easily restored, no wonder their scholars control them like cattle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia moderator &#8220;hameedeh&#8221; then corrects her previous information and says: [[I think it was the Sufiyani that will come in Rajab, not Imam Mahdi AJ. We need a timeline and check things off the list. ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh-oH! I guess the guy whose faith was restored above is going to find some other post on this thread to restore his faith. Secondly, how can you guys confuse your 12th Imam with the Sufiyani? Seriously? I&#8217;ll tell you what though, neither of the two will appear in Rajab as both the 12th Imam and the Sufiyani are fabricated personalities, both invented due to political/tribal reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;FisherKing&#8221; says: [[LOL it hasn&#8217;t even been a month. Sabr.]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is very wise, he&#8217;s right we shouldn&#8217;t rush the &#8216;man&#8217;, we must have Sabr and patience as it takes him time to prepare himself, as if the past 1,200 years weren&#8217;t enough for him to prepare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;Darth Vader&#8221; says: [[it hasn&#8217;t even been a month. I would hold my horses until 2016 or 2017 and above all that I would try to prepare through this time to secure my family]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happened to the Rajab theory? Suddenly you push him back to 2016, 2017? It&#8217;s as if you guys don&#8217;t even want him to appear, how dare you delay his appearance for two years when finally after all this wait, a king called `Abdullah dies! That is surely a sign of Nasibism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;sayedamir2000&#8221; says: [[If you read carefully second hadith you have brought and especially the part that I have highlighted in the hadith, it clearly indicates that we have to wait at least for months and days.]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Months and days you say?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia administrator &#8220;repenter&#8221; says: [[The concept of Imam Mahdi is the same as The holy Kabaa. The Kabaa doesn&#8217;t come to you, you go to the Kabaa, the same way you have to go too Imam Mahdi, not the other way around. ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he said: [[We aren&#8217;t waiting for him, he is waiting for us. See the difference? This whole concept of us &#8220;waiting&#8221; is misunderstood and it is unfortunate. It&#8217;s he who is waiting, not us. ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, their administrator nuked the entire theory of waiting that his sect relied upon for hundreds of years. Instead he claims this was all a &#8220;test&#8221; and this is something we refuted in one of our previous &#8220;Issues of Ghaybah&#8221; articles. It contradicts the mission of the 12th Imam, whose existence is a grace from Allah since he guides his slaves. How then can you guys claim that Allah withheld his grace from us, and removed his infallible guide from among us, then He expects us to increase in faith and piety so that He may make him appear again!? In that case wait for a couple of more thousand years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Shia member called &#8220;Chair Pundit&#8221; replies to the above: [[That doesn&#8217;t make any logical sense. The true Muslims are praying and engaging in positive actions. Thus, the Imam ought to have appeared some time ago. The &#8220;us&#8221; you refer to is specifically authentic Muslims. Why would the Imam be waiting for those who aren&#8217;t true Muslims? Wouldn&#8217;t that just constitute a weak excuse for refusing to reappear? This is utter nonsense.]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The admin of ShiaChat replies back: [[It requires a certain amount of intelligence, reading comprehension and politeness to understand it. To fools, everything sounds like utter nonsense. Care to try again while there is a little amount of dignity left in you?]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wow, what fraternity and unity among the followers of &#8220;Ahlul-Bayt&#8221;, especially when they disagree on the fundamental matter that sets them apart from the rest of the nation (ie Imamah).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;Ibn Al-Shahid&#8221; says: [[There will be a period where anyone who rules Saudi will rule it for a few months and die. That has yet to happen.]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now who fabricated this one? Which Imam was it that made a prophecy about the political situation in &#8220;Saudi&#8221; when there was no such thing as &#8220;Saudi&#8221; back in the days of the Imam?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;MajiC&#8221; says: [[Even so, and as Sheikh Ali Korani has recently expressed in his opinion, if the new king Salman lasts longer than &#8220;months&#8221; i.e. a year or longer then the recent events may not be associated with this hadith. In any case, combining this with the recent Yemeni revolution from which the promised Yamani will soon emerge inshaAllah, ongoing events in Sham and a myriad of other indicators, explicit and more subtle, we really should be expecting the good news in all seriousness. When that will be is in God&#8217;s knowledge alone, but inshaAllah we shall be the generation to witness it.]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ah, the good news is certainly everywhere these days, you can&#8217;t open your TV without seeing a lot of good news all over the middle-east, right? As for their scholar `Ali Kourani, he just makes up odd theories then when they fail and he&#8217;s exposed, his reaction is like &#8220;Meh, if it didn&#8217;t happen then it didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; As easy as pie ain&#8217;t it? Promise the people something, raise their hopes, then say &#8220;Meh, maybe not..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia member &#8220;SlaveOfAllah14&#8221; says: [[I am afraid this may turn to be like the 2012 hoax, after which those who had put too much hope will get dissapointed. ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What he doesn&#8217;t know, or rather refuses to accept, is that this guy never existed in the first place, his entire existence is a hoax and a rumor spread by scum who sought wealth and authority. As the reader can see, this kind of thing often happens in the Shia world, every couple of years there&#8217;s a new random prophecy which is debunked by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other Shia members resorted to poetry and wisdom, such as &#8220;peace seeker II&#8221; who said: [[It&#8217;s good to hope .. Even if one gets disappointed, hope returns<br />
Hope does not mislead .. Hope in the rise of justice is akin to faith ]]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is rather depressing, what a sad sect.</p>
