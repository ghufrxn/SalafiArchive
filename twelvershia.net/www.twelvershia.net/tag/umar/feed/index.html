<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[sa] (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>



<p>Earlier in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the expositions</a> of Answering-Ansar’s lies, it was shown how even a narration found in one of the most prominent Islamic texts, <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, became a target of their deceptive methodology of argumentation because it proves the marriage of `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb with Umm Kulthūm bint `Alī (ra). Of course, those who are familiar with Answering-Ansar and the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> paranoia concerning this marriage know that their deception would not simply end at blatantly lying about the text of the narration.</p>



<p>That narration is:</p>



<p>قال ثعلبة بن أبي مالك إن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قسم مروطا بين نساء من نساء المدينة فبقي مرط جيد فقال له بعض من عنده يا أمير المؤمنين أعط هذا ابنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم التي عندك يريدون أم كلثوم بنت علي فقال عمر أم سليط أحق وأم سليط من نساء الأنصار ممن بايع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال عمر فإنها كانت تزفر لنا القرب يوم أحد</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik said: ‘`Umar (ra) divided up some garments among some of the women of Madīna. One excellent garment remained and one of those with him said: ‘Commander of the believers! Give this to the (grand) daughter of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) to whom you are married—meaning Umm Kul<u>th</u>ūm the daughter of `Alī. `Umar (ra) replied: ‘Umm Salīţ is more entitled. Umm Salīţ was one of the people of Anşār who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allāh (saws).’ `Umar (ra) added: ‘She carried waterskins for us on the day of Uĥud.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 3, page 222 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>After disapproving the text of this narration by lying and advancing a barrage of inane and poorly constructed linguistic arguments, the Answering-Ansar team moves on to criticize its chain of transmission.</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The people of knowledge can identify the deceptive nature of this argument as soon as they first read it. In fact, even a student of knowledge can. But for those who do not know, this analysis concerning the chain of transmission by the Answering-Ansar team is based on transparent dishonesty.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar has stated that the chain of transmission of this narration is unreliable because it is related by Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra). To support this claim, they have proposed the following points about Tha`laba (ra):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is not mentioned in any of the texts pertaining to <em>r</em><em>ijāl</em> [narrators of <em>ĥadī<u>th</u></em>].</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Dhahabī, who includes “all manner” of narrators in his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, has not mentioned him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is a completely unknown person.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, let us examine these claims and observe how much truth there is to them:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One – Tha`laba (ra) in the Texts of <em>Rijāl</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik’s “name is extant from the texts of rijjal.” This, unfortunately, is a barefaced lie because Tha`laba (ra) is mentioned in both <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts of narrator-biographies [<em>rijāl</em>].</p>

</ul>



<p>And in case there remains any doubt, let us also quote some of the abovementioned works so the readers know what the texts of <em>rijāl</em> say about him under his biographical&nbsp;entry&nbsp;[<em>tarjama</em>].</p>



<p>The author of the <em>Şaĥīĥ</em>, Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī himself, writes in <em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي المديني كان كبيرا امام بني قريظة سمع عمر وحارثة بن النعمان وعن ابن عمر سمع منه ابن الهاد والزهري وابنه مالك</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī al-Madīnī: He was great; <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža. He heard narrations from `Umar, Ĥāri<u>th</u>a ibn al-Nu`mān and Ibn `Umar, and Ibn al-Hād, al-Zuhrī and his son Mālik heard narrations from him.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 2, page 174 [Diyarbakir]</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the head <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī, writes in his <em>Rijāl</em> while listing the Companions (ra) who narrated from the Prophet (saws):</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk, the Quražī.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Rijāl al-Ţūsī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460), page 31 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī, who was a renowned <em>Sunnī</em> scholar and master of narrations, also mentions in <em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي المديني إمام مسجد بني قريظة أخرج البخاري في الجهاد وغير موضع عن الزهري عنه عن عمر بن الخطاب وقيس بن سعد قال الكلاباذي له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá, al-Quražī al-Madīnī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī has documented (his) narrations in the (book of) <em>Jihād</em>, and another place, from al-Zuhrī, and from `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>aţţāb and Qays ibn Sa`d. al-Kalābā<u>dh</u>ī said: ‘His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ li man <u>Kh</u>arraj `anh al-Bukhārī fī al-Jāmi` al-Şaĥīĥ</em>, of Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī (d. 474), volume 1, page 447 [Marrakech]</li>
</ul>



<p>In his voluminous and illustrious work on narrators, the <em>Sunnī</em> pinnacle Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī states:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي حليف الأنصار أبو مالك ويقال أبو يحيى المدني إمام مسجد بني قريظة له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá—al-Madanī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Kamāl fī Asmā’ al-Rijāl</em>, of Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī (d. 742), volume 4, page 397 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the major <em>Sunnī</em> scholar of narrations and expert in the field of its narrators, Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī, also writes in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي له رؤية وسمع عمر وعنه ابناه منظور وأبو مالك والزهري</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: His vision (of the Prophet) is proven. He heard narrations from `Umar. His two sons Manžūr and Abū Mālik, and al-Zuhrī heard narrations from him.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if fī Ma`rifat man lahu Riwāya min al-Kutub al-Sitta</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 284 [Jeddah]</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Mīrzā Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī, a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and expert in the field of narrators, writes in <em>Manhaj al-Maqāl</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Manhaj al-Maqāl fī Taĥqīq Aĥwāl al-Rijāl</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī (d. 1028), volume 3, page 130 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author of one of the main texts of <em>rijāl</em> among the <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>, al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī writes in the same work:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي من أصحاب الرسول صلى الله عليه وآله</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: He is from the Companions of the Messenger (saws).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī (d. 1044), volume 1, page 317 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> al-Astarābādī’s and al-Tafrishī’s printed works have&nbsp;a diacritical point missing from “al-Quražī” but the correct word is with a point as elucidated by <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> editors.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī also writes:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Jāmi` al-Ruwāt fī Izāĥat al-Ishtibāhāt `an al-Ţuruq wa al-Isnād</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī (d. 1101), volume 1, page 140 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in short, the famous and major texts of <em>rijāl</em> separately&nbsp;mention&nbsp;Tha`laba (ra) with words that prove nothing but his praiseworthiness. But the Answering-Ansar team confidently “refutes” the chain of transmission by deceptively misleading their readers into thinking that the texts of <em>rijāl</em> do not even mention the <em>name</em> of Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra).</p>

<p>This is what one calls mixing the truth with falsehood. al-Dhahabī has mentioned the biography of Tha`laba (ra) in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>, <em>Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Islām</em> and <em>al-Tajrīd</em>. A quote from <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em> has already been cited and the following is what al-Dhahabī states about him in his dictionary of the Companions of the Prophet (saws), <em>al-Tajrīd</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي إمام بني قريظة ولد في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وله رؤية وطال عمره روى عنه إبنه أبو مالك وصفوان بن سليم له حديثان مرسلان</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá,</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe. He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and his vision (of him) is proven. He lived a long age. His son Abū Mālik and Şafwān ibn Sulaym narrated from him. He has two dispatched narrations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tajrid_sahaba_1_69.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Tajrīd Asmā’ al-Şaĥāba</em>, of <u>Sh</u>ams al-Dīn al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 69 [Beirut]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What the Answering-Ansar team did is that they deceivingly left all these works behind and jumped to <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, while covering the act by lying that the author has mentioned the biographies of “all manner” of narrators in it. The truth, however, is different. It is a known fact that al-Dhahabī has not included all types of narrators in his <em>Mīzān</em>. In fact, <em>Mīzān</em> is a work on narrators whose reliability has been questioned and therefore he has not included many narrators in it, including the Companions of the Prophet (saws).</p>



<p>He explicitly states about the Companions (ra) in the introduction of the work:</p>



<p>ولا أذكرهم في هذا المصنف فإن الضعف إنما جاء من جهة الرواة إليهم وكذا لا أذكر في كتابي من الآئمة المتبوعين في الفروع أحدا لجلالتهم في الاسلام وعظمتهم في النفوس</p>



<p><strong>“I will <u>not mention</u> them in this compilation, for the weakness has come from the sub-narrators that are linked to them. Similarly, I will not mention any of the followed <em>Imāms</em> in this book, such as Abū Ĥanīfa, al-<u>Sh</u>āfi`ī and al-Bu<u>kh</u>arī due their majesty in Islam and essential greatness.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl fī Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 3 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The highly praised <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar al-Mīrzā Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339) also confirms this while criticizing both <em>Sunnīs</em> and al-Dhahabī:</p>



<p>هذا الذهبي على إمامته وجلالته عندهم تأنف من ذكر الصحابة في كتابه</p>



<p><strong>“This al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī, despite of his scholarly leadership and loftiness according to them, utterly detested the mention of the Companions in his book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Qawl al-Şurāĥ fī al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī wa Şaĥīĥih al-Jāmi`</em>, of Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339), page 42 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus, the reason why al-Dhahabī has not included Tha`laba (ra) in his <em>Mīzān</em> is because he is a Companion, as mentioned by him in <em>al-Tajrīd</em>, not because he is unknown, and Answering-Ansar’s claim that al-Dhahabī has included the “biographies of all manner” of narrators in it is yet another example of their dishonesty and misrepresentation of <em>Sunnī</em> texts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three – “Completely Unknown”?</h2>



<p>It has been shown above that the biography of Tha`laba (ra) has been mentioned in over a dozen <em>Sunnī</em> and <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts of narrator-biographies. If someone actually goes through other texts such as compilations of narrations, commentaries and genealogical works,&nbsp;there is no doubt that a lot more can be read about Tha`laba (ra).</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) writes in <em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>Th</u></strong><strong>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk:</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> [al-Ţūsī] has mentioned him among the Companions of the Messenger (saws). This is how the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> has named his father, ‘Abī Malīk.’ However, it is ‘ibn Abī Mālik’ in <em>al-Ţabaqāt</em>, <em>al-Istī`āb</em>, <em>Usd al-<u>Gh</u>āba</em>, <em>al-Işāba</em> and <em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Muĥammad ibn Sa`d said in <em>al-Ţabaqāt al-Kabīr</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh ibn Sām, and <u>Th</u>a`laba is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ Abī Mālik came from Yemen and said: ‘We are from the tribe of Kindah which is on the Jewish religion.’ He then married into the Ibn Sa`ya (family) of the Qurayža tribe and confederated with them; thus it was said: ‘the Quražī.’ He has narrated from `Umar and `U<u>th</u>mān. He used be given the cognomen of ‘Abū Ja`far.’ <u>Th</u>a`laba was <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža until he passed away. He was great and did not narrate many narrations.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in <em>al-Istī`āb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws). The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh, and he—meaning, <u>Th</u>a`laba—is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá’ from Kindah. His father came from Yemen, on the Jewish religion. He was accommodated by the Qurayža tribe and thus he is ascribed to them. He was not one of them, so he accepted Islam. He narrated from `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān and all the Companions.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in </strong><strong><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ His vision (of the Prophet) is proven</strong><strong>. He narrated from the Prophet (saws), `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān, Jābir, Ĥāritha ibn al-Nu`mān and a large group. His two sons Abū Mālik and Manžūr, al-Zuhrī, al-Miswar ibn Rifā`a, Muĥammad ibn `Uqba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, Şafwān ibn Sulaym and others narrated from him. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī said: ‘He was great,&nbsp;<em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža and&nbsp;on the Jewish religion. He married a woman from the tribe of Qurayža and thus he was ascribed to them, while he was (originally) from Kindah. Tha`laba used to lead the tribe of Qurayža in his youth. Abū Ĥātim said: ‘He is from the predecessors.’ al-`Ijlī said: ‘A trustworthy predecessor.’ And Ibn Ĥibbān mentioned him in <em>al-<u>Th</u>iqāt</em> [“The Trustworthy Narrators”].’</strong><strong>’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is not known whether he falls under the condition of our book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn (d. 1371), volume 4, page 22 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up all of the aforementioned information about Tha`laba (ra) present in <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, it is known that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His ancestors were from Yemen.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and lived a long life.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a Companion of the Prophet (saws).</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His cognomen was Abū Mālik—others also said Abū Yaĥyá.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a confederate of the Anşār.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He narrated from `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb, `Uthmān ibn `Affān (ra), and others.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His sons, al-Zuhrī, and others narrated from him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was the <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe until his demise.</li>
</ul>



<p>In spite of this information that is spread throughout innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, the Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is “a completely unknown personality.”</p>



<p>Can this be called anything but outright lying?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>It has been evidently shown that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is not an unknown or unreliable narrator, rather a Companion of the Prophet (saws) whose biography is present in innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, and particularly the texts of <em>rijāl</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to explicitly say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Once again, it has been shown how Answering-Ansar chooses deceptive methods of argumentation by blatantly lying about narrators and Islamic texts for the sole reason of denying a narration that goes against their view.</p>



<p><strong>Is this what the Answering-Ansar team means by their motto, “Revealing the Truth”?</strong></p>



<p>We will let the readers decide.</p>



<p>As for the “Undh” absurdity, that has been covered in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the earlier expositions</a>.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Answering-Ansar team states in their article entitled <i>‘Private lives of the Nasibi Salaf’</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quoting Answering-Ansar:<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">According to Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah Umar indulged in sodomy and Allah (swt) was forced to legitimise this practise in the Qur&#8217;an</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For evidence you can consult the following texts:</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jami al Tirmidhi, Bab al Tafseer Volume 2, page 382, &#8216;Ayat Hars&#8217;</span></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Fathul Bari Volume 8 page 191 Kitab Tafseer Ayat Hars</span><br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;">5. Fayl ai Lawathar Volume 6 page 229</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">6. Tafseer Qurtubi Volume 1 page 92 Ayat Hars</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lets quote verbatim from Jami al Tirmidhi:</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ibn Abbas narrates that Hadhrath Umar went before Rasulullah (s) and &#8220;Master I am destroyed!&#8217;. Rasulullah (s) asked &#8216;what thing has destroyed you?&#8217;. Umar replied last night I had anal sex. Rasulullah (s) did not give a reply to Umar, then Allah (swt) sent down this revelation &#8220;Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; the words &#8216;kabool wa Dhabar&#8217; (the anus is accepted)&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Jami al Tirmidhi, Bab al Tafseer Volume 2, page 382, &#8216;Ayat Hars&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note this is a commentary to Surah al Baqarah, Verse 223 &#8220;Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; the words &#8220;kabool wa Dhabar&#8221; (the anus is accepted) is nowhere to be found in the Qur&#8217;an, but some dishonest Salafi sought to justify his Imam&#8217;s practice via this additional verse. Interestingly the dishonest Urdu translator fails to translate these tahreef words, even though they are there in the Arabic text, (see the scanned reference from the link above).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you see Umar&#8217;s sodomy with his wife is proven from the Saha Sittah of Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah. Umar did this act, made Rasulullah (s) a witness to the deed. The Ulema of Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah should be grateful to Hadhrath Umar, since by sodomising his wife, the Qur&#8217;an gave permission for husbands to penetrate their wives in this manner. They owe this all to their great father Umar Farooq.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The heading of this subchapter clearly shows the approach of Answering-Ansar. Material of this type is highly appreciated in <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> circles, exciting hormone levels and anti-<em>Sunnī</em> sentiments at the same time, as it gives them another reason to malign the majority of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By quoting a narration of <em>Sunan al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī</em> about `Umar (ra) and the revelation of the 223<sup>rd</sup> verse of Sura al-Baqara, the Answering-Ansar team has tried to establish that <em>Sunnī</em> texts prove that `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>aţţāb (ra) indulged in sodomy and the Qur’ān approved of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, this subchapter tells more about the unreliability and dishonesty of Answering-Ansar, as it is nothing but a poorly constructed web of lies based on the following:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistranslation of “ĥawwaltu raĥliya al-layla” in the Narration</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Answering-Ansar team, the “verbatim” translation of the narration in <i>Sunan al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī</i> is:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quoting Answering-Ansar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lets quote verbatim from Jami al Tirmidhi:</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8220;Ibn Abbas narrates that Hadhrath Umar went before Rasulullah (s) and &#8220;Master I am destroyed!&#8217;. Rasulullah (s) asked &#8216;what thing has destroyed you?&#8217;. Umar replied last night I had anal sex. Rasulullah (s) did not give a reply to Umar, then Allah (swt) sent down this revelation &#8220;Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; the words &#8216;kabool wa Dhabar&#8217; (the anus is accepted)&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jami al Tirmidhi, Bab al Tafseer Volume 2, page 382, &#8216;Ayat Hars&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428145734/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/private_lives/en/chap2.php" rel="external nofollow">Private lives of the Nasibi Salaf, page 5-6</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this translation, when `Umar (ra) was asked why he claims of being destroyed, he replied “last night I had anal sex.” This is a clear mistranslation of the real words found in the narration. The original text [Arabic] of this narration states that `Umar (ra) said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حولت رحلي الليلة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>ĥawwaltu raĥliya al-layla</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This short sentence is made of three words. <em>Ĥawwaltu</em> [“I turned”] here is a verb that has the subject [`Umar] hidden within it, <em>raĥliya</em> [“my mount”] is the noun and object in which “mount” is the possession, “my” the possessor [`Umar] and <em>al-layla</em> [“tonight”] again is a noun. Together, they should be translated as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“I turned my mount around tonight.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a known expression among the Arabs that is used to describe sexual intercourse in reverse position—i.e. retrocopulation. Linguists such as Ibn al-A<u>th</u>īr (d. 606), Ibn Manžūr (d. 711) and al-Zabīdī (d. 1205) have mentioned this explicitly in their works. This is well known among the people of knowledge and is in no need of proof. As it is obvious, there are no words in this sentence that can supposedly be translated as “I had anal sex” and Answering-Ansar has shown untruthfulness by deliberately doing so.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mistranslation of <em>“aqbil wa adbir”</em> [“kabool wa dhabar”]</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the narration, Answering-Ansar ends the verbatim with:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“the words ‘kabool wa Dhabar (the anus is accepted)”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This just places a milestone on the ignorance of the Answering-Ansar team. Only Allāh knows where “the words” came in the translation from. But what tops all is the daft transliteration [“kabool wa Dhabar”] right after it. The real words found in the narration are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أقبل وأدبر</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>aqbil wa adbir</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any Muslim who reads the Holy Qur’ān can easily make out that these words cannot be read as “kabool wa Dhabar.” Astonishingly, the Answering-Ansar team could not even fabricate a proper transliteration for their false translation—despite of the diacritics present on the scan image they have attached!—due to their profound ignorance, because even if the transliteration presented by Answering-Ansar is translated, it would be translated into “acceptance and anus” not “the anus is accepted.” The latter, if translated from Arabic, should have been “<em>al-duburu maqbūlun</em>” not “kabool wa Dhabar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real words used in the narration are <em>aqbil</em> and <em>adbir</em>, as one can also see from the scan provided by Answering-Ansar. Both of these words cannot, <em>anyhow</em>, be translated as “the anus is accepted.” <em>Aqbil</em> comes from the root noun of “<em>iqbāl</em>” [drawing near] and <em>adbir</em> comes from “<em>idbār</em>” [drawing away]. When both of these words are used together, they give a meaning of “back and forth.” This is something simple and does not require any complex Arabic rule to be understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hans Wehr Dictionary states under “<i>iqbāl</i>”:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“<em>iqbāl</em> drawing near, advance, approach; coming arrival, advent, turning application, attention, response, responsiveness (to), concern (for), interest (in), demand; good fortune, prosperity welfare </strong><strong>ǀ</strong><strong> <em><u>iqbālan wa idbāran</u></em><u> back and forth, to and from, up and down</u>.”</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><em>A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic</em>, of Hans Wehr, page 741 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of the words used here are clearly in imperative command, and they should be translated as the following according to the context:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“Approach from the front and back”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the words of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) said to `Umar (ra) after the revelation of the verse and it tells that the he (saws) allowed different positions during sexual intercourse—something considered abominable by `Umar (ra) first as mentioned in the narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Someone should ask Answering-Ansar though, if <em>aqbil</em> and <em>adbir</em> are to be translated as “the anus is accepted,” what do they make of the following narration found in their own texts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">عن أبي جعفر عليه السلام قال لما خلق الله العقل استنطقه ثم قال له أقبل فأقبل ثم قال له أدبر فأدبر</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“Abū Ja`far (as) said: ‘When Allāh created intelligence, He made it speak and then said to it: ‘Come forward’ [<em>aqbil</em>]. It came forward. He then said to it: ‘Go back’ [<em>adbir</em>]. It went back.’”</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 10 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the words of al-Ţabrasī’s <i>Mi<u>sh</u>kāt al-Anwār</i>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“When Allāh created intelligence, He said to it: ‘Come forward’ [<em>aqbil</em>]. It came forward. He then said to it: ‘Go back’ [<em>adbir</em>]. It went back.’”</strong></p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can the Answering-Ansar team tell their readers why they wrongfully translated and transliterated the narration found in <i>Sunnī</i> texts?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Distortion by removing <em>“wa ittaqi al-dubura wa al-ĥīđa”</em>from the Narration</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far it has become clear that the narration suggests that `Umar (ra) had sexual intercourse with his spouse in the unordinary reverse position [retrocopulation] and considered it abominable, when he went to the Messenger of Allāh (saws), the verse declaring approaching women ‘however you wish’ was revealed, and the Prophet allowed approaching the wives from the front or the back for sexual intercourse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Answering-Ansar team tried hard to mistranslate sentences from the narration to prove their dogma and deceive common Muslims. And to do so, they even went to the extent of removing the part that completely shatters their propaganda. An entire sentence after <em>aqbil wa adbir</em> was removed by the Answering-Ansar team in order to save their ark of trickery from drowning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration relates that the Messenger of Allāh (saws) added right after <em>aqbil wa adbir</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">واتق الدبر والحيضة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>wa ittaqi al-dubura wa al-ĥīđa</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“and protect yourself from the anus and menses”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These words explicitly prove that `Umar’s (ra) question and the Prophet’s (saws) reply discussed earlier did not involve “anal sex” anyhow, because it is impossible that the Prophet (saws) allowed and disallowed sodomy with women in the same breath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the whole thing should be correctly translated as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أقبل وأدبر واتق الدبر والحيضة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“Approach</strong> <strong>from the front and back</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>and protect yourself from the anus and menses.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact is that this narration proves the impermissibility of sodomy with women and the scholars of <em>Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jamā`a</em> use this it as an evidence for the impermissibility! The Answering-Ansar team, of course, saw that the last part of the narration would expose their lie, so they chose to tamper with the “verbatim” by completely removing it from the translation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">False Accusation of Dishonesty on the Translator</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After mistranslating, mistransliterating and unashamedly tampering with the text, the Answering-Ansar team has the audacity to blatantly lie by accusing the translator of <em>Sunan al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī</em> of dishonesty. They say:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quoting Answering-Ansar:<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Note this is a commentary to Surah al Baqarah, Verse 223 &#8220;Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; the words &#8220;kabool wa Dhabar&#8221; (the anus is accepted) is nowhere to be found in the Qur&#8217;an, but some dishonest Salafi sought to justify his Imam&#8217;s practice via this additional verse. Interestingly the dishonest Urdu translator fails to translate these tahreef words, even though they are there in the Arabic text, (see the scanned reference from the link above).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428145734/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/private_lives/en/chap2.php" rel="external nofollow">Private lives of the Nasibi Salaf, page 5-6</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Subĥān Allāh</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Urdu translator of <em>Sunan al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī</em> has translated all the words of the narration, but the Answering-Ansar team accuses him of dishonesty because he correctly translated the narration instead of cramming it with idiotic translations such as “the anus is accepted.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After translating the narration, he himself adds:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“His statement: <em>‘I turned my mount around…’</em> [<em>phayr dī may</em><em>ṅ nay apnī sawārī</em></strong><strong>] Here the wife is meant by the <em>‘mount</em>,<em>’</em> as the man takes the wife like a mount during copulation, and the <em>‘turned’</em> is that the copulation was done with the front, from the back. In short, `Umar (ra) may have guilt in him, so Allāh (swt) allowed it and the fear was lifted.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>His statement: <em>‘</em><em>Copulate from the front…</em><em>’</em> [<em>sāmnay say şuĥbat kar</em>] This address, however, (means that) the penetration should be of the front, and then the copulation may be done from any side.”</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><em>Jā’izat al-<u>Sh</u>a`ūdhī Tarjuma Jāmi` al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī (Urdu)</em>, of Badī` al-Zamān, volume 2, page 382 [Karachi]</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This clearly explains why the translation should not be as “last night I had anal sex” and “the anus is accepted.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the Answering-Ansar team and their followers should pay some heed before dishonestly accusing others, because the translator has translated the whole narration correctly, and he does not humiliate himself by lying and showing his poor Arabic skills with transliterations such as “kabool wa Dhabar.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">False Claim about the Distortion of the Qur’ān</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last but not the least, Answering-Ansar also states that this narration refers to the distortion of the Holy Qur’ān by referring to parts of it as “tehreef words.” This is yet another lie in the long list of lies by the Answering-Ansar team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no conjunction found between the verse and the words of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) to claim the whole thing is a verse and the latter part is not found in the Qur’ān. In addition to that, other versions of the same narration explicitly state that the Messenger of Allāh (saws) himself made the last statement about approaching the wives from back and forth and protecting oneself from sodomy with women and menses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For reference, please refer to:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may be hard for the Answering-Ansar team to distinguish this narration from narrations that prove the distortion of the Qur’ān since the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts consecutively report such narrations, but there is no doubt that <em>this</em> narration has nothing to do with the distortion of the Qur’ān. The Answering-Ansar team deceitfully claims so to save themselves from the fire by blaming the translator of dishonesty and putting this forward as the reason.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion – The Correct Translation and Understanding of the Incident</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The correct translation of this narration should be:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">جاء عمر إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال يا رسول الله هلكت قال وما أهلكك قال <u>حولت رحلي الليلة</u> قال فلم يرد عليه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم شيئا قال فأنزلت على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذه الآية نساؤكم حرث لكم فأتوا حرثكم أنى شئتم <u>أقبل وأدبر واتق الدبر والحيضة</u></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“`Umar came to the Messenger of Allāh (saws) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, I am destroyed!’ He [i.e. Prophet] asked: ‘And what has destroyed you?’ He said: ‘<u>I turned my mount around tonight</u>.’ The Messenger of Allāh (saws) gave him no answer and this verse was revealed to him: <em>‘Your women are tillage for you to cultivate. So, come to your tillage from where you wish;’</em> </strong><strong><u>Approach from the front and back, </u></strong><strong><u>and protect yourself from the anus and menses</u>.”</strong></p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note:</strong> All other references provided by the Answering-Ansar team are secondary sources that quote <em>Sunan al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident, this narration opposes the permissibility of sodomy with women, and this is how the<em>Sunnī</em> scholars have used this narration throughout history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the Answering-Ansar team, in order to achieve their motives, chose to:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Mistranslate the words of `Umar (ra) – “I turned my mount around tonight” [<em>ĥawwaltu raĥliya al-layla</em>] as “I had anal sex last night.”</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li>Mistranslate the words of the Prophet (saws) – “From the front and back” [<em>aqbil wa adbir</em>] as “the anus is accepted.”</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li>Mistransliterate <em>“aqbil wa adbir”</em> as “kabool wa Dhabar” to deceptively support their mistranslation.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li>Tamper with this narration – Snipping “protect yourself from the anus and menses” [<em>wa ittaqi al-dubura wa al-ĥīđa</em>] from the narration because it proves that this narration doesn’t allow sodomy with women.<em> </em></li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li>Blatantly lie that the Urdu translator did not translate parts of the narration to save themselves from criticism.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li>Falsely claim that this narration propagates the belief in the distortion of the Holy Qur’ān, in order to find an excuse to falsely accuse the translator of dishonesty.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the clear examples of how reliable and trustworthy Answering-Ansar is with their claims and quotations.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Did Anyone Benefit from this Propaganda?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be known that this subchapter, along with its lies, has not only shown disrespect to the early and late Muslims, but also gave another excuse to the Christian Missionaries to attack our beloved Prophet, Muhammad (saws). Among them is the discourteous critic of Islam, Sam Shamoun, who has used this twaddle of lies by the Answering-Ansar team to claim that Prophet Muhammad (saws) degraded women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He states in one of his works entitled <em>‘Women in Islam’</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“Finally, here is a narration from al-Tirmidhi regarding Muhammad permitting Umar to engage in anal sex with his wives:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>“Ibn Abbas narrates that Hadhrath Umar went before the Messenger of God and said, ‘Master I am destroyed!’ The Messenger of God asked, ‘What thing has destroyed you?’ Umar replied, ‘Last night I had anal sex.’ The Messenger of God did not give a reply to Umar, then Allāh sent down this revelation, ‘Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; the words &#8220;kabool wa Dhabar&#8221; (the anus is accepted).’&#8221; (<em>Jami Al-Tirmidhi</em>, Bab al-Tafseer, Volume 2, p. 382, <em>Ayat Hars</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>To read the original Arabic text of this hadith please </strong><strong>go </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428145734/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/private_lives/trimdhi_v2_p382.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.”</strong></p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can the Answering-Ansar team inform their readers of who is responsible for this insult of our beloved Prophet (saws) that is based on mistranslation and distortion of a narration?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A Bit from the Overflowing Knowledge</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the following few points should also be noted about this subchapter so the reader could know a little more about the knowledgeable pillars behind the Answering-Ansar project:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>There is no “Bab al-Tafseer” in <em>Sunan </em>of al-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ī. It is <em>Abwāb Tafsīr al-Qur’ān</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The third reference provided by the Answering-Ansar team for the narration is “Gharab al Quran” while the title of the actual book is <em>Gharā’ib al-Qur’ān</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The next one, states “Tafseer al Ibn Katheer” which is linguistically incorrect. It should be<em>Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr</em> as “ibn” here is a possessive noun, and a possessive noun can never have “al” before it. A rule learnt in the beginning stages of Arabic study.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The fifth reference is “Fayl ai Lawathar” while the title of the book is <em>Nayl al-Awţār</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>They mention that their lies are proven from “the Saha Sittah.” The actual word is <em>Şiĥāĥ</em> not “Saha.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allāh save all of us from ignorance and dishonesty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or as it is in Answering-Ansar’s case, from the mixture of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Carrying on our little series on the prohibition of Hadiths by the companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , we examine the evidences brought by Shia scholars who have alleged that Omar banned Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidences for Prohibition of Hadith Documentation by Omar</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shihristani quotes the three narrations in order to establish a banning on Hadiths by Omar. These narrations are as follows (p. 21-22):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- It has been narrated on the authority of `Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that when Omar had intended to record the Holy Sunnah, he consulted the companions of the Holy Prophet, and they advised him to record. For about a month, Omar set to seek Almighty Allah’s proper guidance in this regard. One morning, after Allah had decided for him, Omar said, ‘I had intended to record the Holy Sunnah, but I remembered some past nations who applied themselves completely to the items they had written and, as a result, neglected the Book of Almighty Allah. By Allah I swear! I will never allow anything to interfere with the Book of Allah.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Yahya ibn Ju`dah narrated that after Omar ibn al-Khattab had intended to record the Holy Sunnah, he changed his mind and distributed a missive in the countries ordering people to erase any item of the Holy Sunnah that they might have recorded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- It has been narrated on the authority of al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu-Bakr that Omar, after he had received news confirming that people started to hold (or write) books, denied and disliked the matter saying, ‘O people: I have been informed that you have started to hold books. Allah’s most beloved books must be the fairest and the straightest. Now, I order you all to bring me all the books that you hold so that I will decide about them.’ Thinking that Omar wanted to correct and submit the books to a certain criterion, all people brought their books to him. Instead, he set them all to fire and said, ‘This is a false wish just like that of the Christians and the Jews.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shihristani adds: According to Ibn Sa`d, in his al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Omar said, ‘This is a Mishna just like that of the Christians and the Jews.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, all three of these narrations are disconnected since none of these men lived during the time of Omar. Urwa bin Al-Zubair was the oldest of the three and was born during the time of Uthman. Al-Qasim bin Mohammad was born in the last year of Uthman’s reign or during the beginning of Ali’s reign. Yahya bin Ju’dah youngest of the three.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the first narration, which is the strongest of the three, does not suggest a prohibition on Hadith documentation. It merely describes Omar’s own personal decision to not write the Hadiths. The narration in Arabic ends with Omar saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إني كنت أردت أن أكتب السنن&#8230; وإني والله لا ألبس كتاب الله بشيء أبدا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I wanted to write the traditions… and I, by Allah, will not mix with the book of Allah anything ever.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second and third narrations are evidences for prohibition of documentation, however, as we have stated, they are disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third narration, the one by Al-Qasim bin Mohammad, is also an impossible narration, given the interpretation provided by Al-Shihristani and co., for it is an impossibility for Omar to have been able to swindle all the Muslims into collecting all their Hadith books before burning them. The narrations suggests that Omar “had received news confirming that people started to hold (or write) books.” This implies that Omar was not aware that people documented Hadiths, which is also impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most importantly, if this event really did occur, then it would have been a famous narration with multiple authentic chains, due to the gravity of the matter, which is why we find many narrations about Uthman’s burning of the <em>masahif</em>, unlike this single disconnected uncorroborated report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidences of Permissibility of Hadith Documentation by Omar</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, there are other narrations that suggest that Omar did write Hadiths. These include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Omar wrote to Utbah bin Farqad what the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him – said about the prohibition of wearing silk. (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5828.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Omar was told by Abdulrahman bin Awf that the Prophet – peace be upon him – took taxes from the Majoos, so he wrote to Jaz’ bin Mu’awiyah that narration ordering him to take taxes from them. (Sunan Abi Dawud #3043 – Authentic chain.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Omar wrote a Hadith to Abu Ubaidah about an uncle’s inheritance according to the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . (Sunan Al-Tirmithi #643. Al-Tirmithi said: Hasan.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">M. A`zami also quotes in his Dirasat fi Al-Hadith Al-Nabawi (p. 92-142) the names of fifty two companions that have documented narrations. His study includes eye witness accounts of these documents, its contents, and at times the names of those that have received these texts. This purely contradicts the idea of a prohibition of Hadith documentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Counter Argument and Rebuttal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Shi’ee may attempt to reconcile all the above by arguing that the evidences of Omar’s documentation of narrations were a double standard and that he didn’t adhere to his own banning. Shias may also argue that the evidences of documentation by companions were done privately away from the eyes of the government that imposed the ban.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response, we say that one would need to first establish the existence of a ban before attempting to reconcile these narrations. One only seeks to reconcile between apparently contradicting events if they were equal in strength, which is not the case in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And praise be to Allah the Most Gracious and Most Merciful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Why did `Umar ibn al-Khattab (ra) wish to cut the tongue of his son `Ubaydullah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imami Rafidah claim that `Ali and his four or five companions were always oppressed and humiliated by the Caliphs, those who claim this couldn&#8217;t be more wrong and below we see why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Masawi&#8217;-ul-Akhlaq lil-Khara&#8217;iti we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">حَدَّثَنَا الرَّمَادِيُّ بْنُ إِسْحَاقَ السَّلُولِيُّ، ثنا قَيْسٌ، عَنْ وَائِلٍ، عَنِ الْبَهِيِّ، أَنَّ عُبَيْدَ اللَّهِ بْنَ عُمَرَ، سَبَّ الْمِقْدَاد بْنَ عَمْرٍو، فَقَالَ عُمَرُ: &#8221; عَلَيَّ نَذْرٌ إِنْ لَمْ أَقْطَعْ لِسَانَهُ &#8220;، فَمَشَى إِلَيْهِ نَاسٌ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّبِيِّ فَكَلَّمُوهُ، فَقَالَ: &#8221; دَعُونِي أَقْطَعْ لِسَانَهُ، فَلا يَسُبَّ بَعْدِي أَصْحَابَ الرَّسُولِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahmad bin Mansour al-Ramadi (Thiqah Hafiz) -&gt; Ishaq bin Mansour al-Saluli (Thiqah) -&gt; Qays bin al-Rabi` al-Asadi (Saduq Yukhti&#8217; Shi`ee) -&gt; Wa&#8217;il bin Dawoud al-Taymi (Thiqah) -&gt; `Abdullah bin Yasar al-Bahy (Saduq Yukhti&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[That `Ubaydullah bin `Umar once cursed at al-Miqdad bin `Amro (al-Aswad), upon hearing this `Umar bin al-Khattab said: &#8220;I vow to cut-off his tongue!&#8221; but a group from the companions of the Prophet (saw) went to `Umar and talked him out of it, so he said: &#8220;Let me cut-off his tongue so that no one may insult the companions of the Messenger (saw) after me.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in al-Shifa fi Akhbar al-Mustafa by al-Qadi `Iyad we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">وَرُوي عَن عُمَر بن الخطاب: أنَّه نَذَر قَطع لِسان عُبَيْد اللَّه بن عُمَر إذ شَتَم الْمِقْدَاد بن الأسْود، فَكُلم فِي ذَلِك، فَقَال: دَعُونِي أقْطَع لِسانَه، حَتَّى لَا يَشْتم أحَد بَعْد أَصْحَاب النَّبِيّ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was narrated from `Umar bin al-Khattab that he vowed to cut-off the tongue of (his son) `Ubaydullah bin `Umar when he cursed at al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad, but they tried talking him out of it so he said: &#8220;Let me cut-off his tongue so that after it no one may insult the companions of the Prophet (saw).&#8221;]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original <a title="The Prohibition of Mutah Marriages" href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/02/12/prohibition-mutah-marriages/" rel="external nofollow"><em>mutah</em></a> article, we have provided several narrations that prove that <em>mutah</em> was prohibited by the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; during his time. However, there were claims made by some of the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – companions that suggest that <em>mutah</em> was prohibited during the time of Omar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrations of Jabir and Ibn Abbas are the ones most often cited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Musanaf Abd Al-Razaq #14021, through an authentic chain, we can find Ibn Abbas saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;If it were not for his prohibition (Omar’s), then only a vile person would perform adultery.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same book we find Jabir saying that people were prevented from performing <em>mutah</em> due to what happened with Amr bin Huraith towards the end of the caliphate of Omar, and that <em>mutah</em> was practiced during the time of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; and Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it has already been established in our first article about <em>mutah</em> that it was prohibited during the time of the Prophet – peace be upon him -, so why are these two companions attributing it to Omar?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence that Omar Relied on a Prophetic Tradition to Ban Mutah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find a narration in Sunan Ibn Majah #1953 in which Omar says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him – allowed us to perform <em>mutah</em> for three (days), then prohibited it. By Allah, if I knew that one of you performs <em>mutah</em> and is fortified, I will stone him (to death), unless he comes to me with four that testify that the Messenger – peace be upon him – permitted it after prohibiting it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration is authentic, even though Aban bin Abdullah bin Abi Hazim was weakened by some, one finds that he was deemed trustworthy by Yahya bin Ma’een, Imam Ahmad, and Ibn Numair. Ibn Adi adds that he did not find any <em>munkar</em> traditions from Aban. See Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb 1/54.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, even if one were to accept the criticism of Ibn Hibban, who weakened him for relating uncorroborated traditions, we find that the narration by Omar is corroborated by Ali, Ibn Omar, Sabra, and Salama. Thus, to treat this report as an uncorroborated tradition is unjust. <strong>Refer to the original </strong><strong><em>mutah</em></strong><strong> article for references.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Scholars of Ahl Al-Sunnah often argue that since none of the companions could bring evidences proving that <em>mutah</em> was made permissible after prohibition, it must mean that <em>mutah</em> must have stayed prohibited. The narration of Omar above, and his request for witnesses itself suggests that there wasn’t an opposition that could prove otherwise. All they could do was prove that <em>mutah</em> existed at one time, which is something all the companions agreed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias today attempt to cast doubts by suggesting that the companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him – only stayed quiet due to their fear of Omar. Little did they know that Omar was indeed open to being corrected in matters of jurisprudence, and has on several occasions accepted evidences provided by opponents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this is the narration in Sunan Abi Dawud #2538 that the compensation that is paid for a dead man goes to the father’s side of his family, and that his wife gets no compensation. Omar held this opinion until Al-Dahhak bin Sufyan told him that the Prophet – peace be upon him – allowed the wife of Ashyam Al-Dhibabi to inherit him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another is from Musanaf Abd Al-Razaq #17706 in which he used to say that the compensation for a finger that is cut off differs in price from the most useful to the least useful finger. He was then told that the Prophet – peace be upon him – wrote to the family of Hazm that all fingers receive the same compensation. Omar then changed his opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, Omar was always someone who was open to being corrected, and has changed his opinion on several occasions when evidence has been brought to him. It is due to this that one must accept that the silence of the companions suggests that they were in agreement with Omar. More importantly, those that believed in the permissibility of <em>mutah</em> did not have clear evidences to prove that <em>mutah</em> was made permissible after the year of the conquest of Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This leads to the question: Why did some companions still accept <em>mutah </em>as permissible? The answer to that question will be looked at in the following chapter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article entitled: Ibn Umar Buying Slave Girl. The article was published on the 8th of June, 2012, and can be found <a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/ibn-umar-buying-slave-girl/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA, in regular fashion, quotes a Sunni narration without recognizing the repercussions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Naf’i narrates from Ibn Umarr that he whenever he (Ibn Umar) bought a slave girl, he exposed her legs and put his hand between her breasts and her bottom/hips and when he did that, he did it from behind the clothes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA, seems to be implying that Ibn Umar had sexual motives when he examined slave girls. However, SoA does not seem to be aware that this was because slave girl trade was similar to other trades, in which buyers had to rely on their senses, and not solely on the word of the salesperson. It is in this light that Ibn Umar saw it as permissible to touch slave girls (not directly, but with clothes as a separation) in order to inspect if they meet his requirements. If Ibn Umar’s actions were purely sexual, then he may as well have touched her from under her clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One should be aware that slaves were bought and sold and that some matters that surrounded them were seen as permissible when they usually would not be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similar to the above, we find that Ali, the first infallible imam, in an authentic Shia chain, did the same thing:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
[Mohammad Al-Baqir narrated from Ali (alaihi al-salam) that when he wanted to buy a slave girl, he would expose her legs and look at her.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following is a response to ValiAsr-Aj.com’s article: Holy Prophet was Afraid of Umar? The article published on SlaveOfAhlubait’s blog, on the 29th of April, 2012, and can be found<a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/holy-prophet-was-afraid-of-umar/" rel="external nofollow"> here</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The article unlike the usual articles, contains a cheerful story, in which A’isha and Sawda, the wives of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) were playful with their food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SlaveOfAhlubait, translated the narration as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Ayesha says that Holy Prophet asws came and I had made food, So I presented that. I told Sauda, and Holy Prophet was between Me and Her: Eat. She refused. So I told Her eat this or I ll put it on your face. She refused again. I put my hand in food and put that on her face. So Holy Prophet laughed. So He put his hand on her and told her: Put that on her face. He laughed. Then Umar came. He said: o Abdullah, o Abdullah. So Holy Prophet presumed that He would enter. He told us to Stand up, and wash our face. So Ayesha said: so I fear Umar like Holy Prophet asws</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">[Musnad Abu Ya&#8217;la, vol 7, page 449, research by Hussein Salim Asad, first edition, 1404]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the title of the article seems irrelevant to the content of the narration, we find that the term “afraid” is what seems to have caused the confusion in the text.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The term used in Arabic in this narration was haiba, which is a higher form of respect. Ancient dictionaries of the language like Al-Azhari’s Tahtheeb Al-Lugha 4/3687 and Ibn Al-Athir’s Al-Nihaya p.1017 explain the term not only as fear, but as a form of respect. They explain it as to be seen in a respected light and thus raised in status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The term haiba cannot be attributed to petty criminals or to wild animals. One person may have makhafa (fear) towards them, but there is no haiba in the matter, for animals are seen as lower beings, and nobody respects a criminal in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, the term haiba is most commonly found in the hearts of the young towards the old, or the student to the teacher. A student feels haiba towards his teacher not out of fear of being beaten, but due to the respect that fills his heart and the high status of his teacher in his eyes. The student does his best to not be found playing or fooling around when there is a slight chance being caught by his teacher, even if such an action is halal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similarly, as we can see above, the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) did not feel comfortable with Omar walking in on his wives, laughing with food on their faces. It was not because he was afraid that Omar would attack them for being in such a state, for the very notion of such is silly, but it was because Omar’s character and stern nature is one that was to be respected.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Without further ado:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>A-Fadak in the Qur’aan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS quote several narrations in order to prove that Fadak was mentioned in the Qur’an. They quote:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">&#8220;When &#8216;And give to the near of kin his due&#8217; was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (saw) gave Fadak to Faatima (s.a).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #333333;">They relied on Al-Haskani’s narrations. Not surprisingly, all these narrations are weak. Due to the length of the chains, we will only point out one weakness with each chain instead of shedding light on the whole chain.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First narration through Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri: Weak since it is from Attiyyah. We will expand on this later. It is also weak since Attiyyah is a mudalis that used to refer to Ibn Al-Kalbi as Abu Sa’eed. This is the opinion of Imam Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadi. See Mu’jam Al-Mudaliseen p. 331. Ibn Al-Kalbi was a notorious liar. See his biography in Mizan Al-I’itidal. Al-Khateeb said: Attiyyah changed his name in order to make people think he was referring to the tafseer of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri. See previous source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second narration through Abu Sa’eed: See previous comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Third narration through Abu Sa’eed: See previous comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourth narration through Abu Sa’eed: See previous comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifth narration through Abu Sa’eed: See previous comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixth narration through Abu Sa’eed: See previous comments. We add that in this narration, we find that Abu Sa’eed is referred to Al-Khudri instead of Abu Sa’eed, which supposedly negates our previous claim. However, it comes to us through Bakr bin Rustum, which was weakened by Abu Zur’ah in his biography in Al-Jarh wal Ta’deel by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seventh narration through Ali bin Abi Talib: Weak since it came through the path of Al-Munthir bin Mohammad Al-Qaboosi. He was weakened by Al-Daraqutni. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eighth narration through Ibn Abbas: Weak since it comes through Attiyyah, who we will expand on in the next part of our refutation. It also weak since it comes through anonymous narrators like Abdullah bin Manee’.<br />
Ninth narration through Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri in Al-Dur Al-Manthoor: The hadith is rejected since no chain is included.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tenth narration Ibn Abbas in Al-Dur Al-Manthoor: The hadith is rejected since no chain is included.<br />
Eleventh narration in Musnad Abi Ya’la through Abu Sa’eed: Refer to the first narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS, anticipating our arguments, have gone through the trouble of attempting to strengthen Attiyyah. They have provided the following evidences:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- He was strengthened by Yahya bin Ma’een.<br />
2- He was strengthened by Ibn Sa’ad.<br />
3- Ibn Hajar referred to him as truthful(Saduq).<br />
4- He was strengthened by Ibn Shaheen.<br />
5- He was strengthened by Al-Ijli.<br />
6- Mohammad Awama stated that Al-Tirmithi saw his hadith as Hasan.<br />
7- Ibn Khuzayma used his narrations in his Book of Tawheed in which he only used authentic reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before even responding to the above, we provide the names of those that have weakened Attiyyah. Mughlatai (see Al-Iktifa’a 3/229-232) includes the names of the following scholars: Hushaim bin Basheer, Al-Saji, Al-Thawri, Imam Ahmad, Yahya bin Ma’een, Al-Nasa’ee, Al-Ijli, Al-Sa’adi, Ibn Adi, Abu Hatim Al-Razi, Abu Zur’ah, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Hazm. In other words, this is a clear majority. Now, we respond to the points above:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- As we have pointed above, Yahya bin Ma’een weakened him, and this was related by Al-Uqaili according to Mughlatai. Ibn Shaheen also quoted Ibn Ma’een’s weakened of Attiyyah in his book of weak narrators (p. 273). In Ibn Tahman’s book of questions to Yahya (p. 78), he refers to him as: La ba’sa bihi, meaning that he is &#8220;not bad&#8221;. We can come to the conclusion that Yahya had different opinions of Attiyyah and did not stick to one view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- This is correctly attributed to Ibn Sa’ad, and we reject his opinion since it goes against the majority of the scholars of hadith, who are greater in quantity and more knowledgeable than him in this field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- We agree with Ibn Hajar regarding Attiyyah’s truthfulness, however, we weaken his reports due to his weakness in narrating. Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb &#8220;Saduq, makes many mistakes, he was a Shi`ee Mudallis&#8221; The fact that he said &#8220;Makes MANY mistakes&#8221; is usually enough to weaken his narration according to the majority of scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Ibn Shaheen did not strengthen him, but only quoted the opinion of Yahya. Furthermore, he quoted the opinion of Yahya weakening him too. Refer to the response to the first point above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Al-Ijli’s words refer to Attiyyah’s truthfulness, not his ability to narrate narrations, which is clear from his words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Al-Tirmithi never said that every hadith that is hasan makes the narrator hasan. His definition of a hasan hadith is one that is not shaadh, has supporting chains, and does not include a liar. These conditions fit some of the narrations of Attiyyah. As the reader can see, Attiyyah is never accused of lying by anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Ibn Khuzaimah actually weakens Attiyyah but only uses his narrations when the narration is authentic through another chain. Refer to his Saheeh 2/1139. This is the case with the example provided by RTS, which comes through the hadith Jabir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>B- Abu Bakr requesting Fatima to provide Two Witnesses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS quote narrations that are similar to the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Al-Mada&#8217;ini from Sa&#8217;eed ibn Khalid, servant of Khuza&#8217;a from Musa ibn Uqba who said: Faatima (s.a) entered upon Aboo Bakr when he was paid allegiance, she said: &#8220;Umm Ayman and Rabah bear witness for me that the Messenger of Allah (saw) gave me the Fadak.&#8221; Aboo Bakr said: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! There is no one more dear to me than your father, I wished the Judgment Day had happened in the day that he passed away, I prefer A&#8217;isha to encounter poverty rather than your poverty, do you think I give every red and black their rights and I oppress you, while you are the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (saw)? This wealth is for the Muslims. Your father used to appoint people over it and spent it for charity. I will do with it what your father did. Faatima (s.a) said: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! I will not speak to you!&#8221; He said: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! I will not leave speaking with you.&#8221; She said: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! I will pray to Allah (swt) against you.&#8221; He said: &#8220;But I will pray to Allah (swt) for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Ansaab Al-Ashraaf. Vol. 10, Pg. # 79.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They provide several narrations that suggest that Abu Bakr requested witnesses, then attempted to worm his way out of it by asking for more witnesses. However, as we all know in the authentic report in Saheeh Al-Bukhari and other famous Sunni works, none of this happened. Abu Bakr simply rejected Fatima’s claim by providing the narration that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said that he will not have any inheritors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response to the narrations provided by RTS we say:<br />
First narration by Musa bin Uqba in Ansab Al-Ashraf: Weak due to Sa’eed bin Khalid who was weakened by Al-Bukhari, Abu Zur’ah, Abu Hatim, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Daraqutni. See his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second narration by Ahmad bin Abd Al-Azeed Al-Jawhari: The narration is weak since it comes through the path of Hisham Al-Kalbi and his father. Both were accused of fabricating narrations. See their biographies in Mizan Al-I’itidal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Third narration by Al-Balathuri in Futooh Al-Buldan: Weak due to the anonymity of Al-Baladhuri himself and Ja’wana, and also weak due to disconnection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourth narration by Al-Balathuri in Futooh Al-Buldan: Weak due to the anonymity of Al-Baladhuri, Rawh, and “a man”, and disconnection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifth narration by Al-Fakhr Al-Razi: Weak due to absence of chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixth narration by Al-Hamawi: Weak due to absence of chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seventh narration by Al-Mohib Al-Tabari: Weak due to absence of chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eighth narration by Ibn Shabbah: The chain includes Al-Numairi bin Hassaan, who is anonymous. Plus, the hadith is disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ninth narration by Al-Sarkhasi: Weak due to absence of chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tenth narration by Ibn Hazm: Weak due to absence of chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>C- Ignorance of RTS regarding Inheritance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS, in this chapter, quote narrations that suggest that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) left behind several things. We will quote some of these narrations before providing the understanding of RTS:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Isa bin Tahman: Anas brought out to us two worn out leather shoes without hair and with pieces of leather straps. Later on Thabit Al-Banani told me that Anas said that they were the shoes of the Prophet (saw).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Abu Burda: A&#8217;isha brought out to us a patched wool Len garment, and she said, &#8220;(It chanced that) the soul of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) was taken away while he was wearing this.&#8221; Abu-Burda added, &#8220;A&#8217;isha brought out to us a thick waist sheet like the ones made by the Yemenites, and also a garment of the type called Al-Mulabbada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Saheeh Al-Bukhari. Pg. # 766, H # 3107 / 3108</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Ibn Kathir:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">As for the mule, it was grey…and it is said that it lived after him (saw) and it was with Alee ibn Abi Talib (a.s) during his caliphate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Bidaya Wa An-Nihaya. Vol. 8, Pg. # 381.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS then argue the following:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">Taking all this evidence in to consideration, how is it possible for one to deny that the Prophet (saw) did not leave behind any inheritance? Then what was this property so often referred to? More importantly, all this was left in the hands of the kin of the Prophet (saw) with the exception of Anas who was his servant. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask the objective reader if this understanding of RTS fits with the idea of inheritance. Why did Anas and A’isha inherit material possessions of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) instead of more worthy inheritors like Fatima, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain? The simple answer is that these materials were not inherited by them, but whatever was left behind by the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) was spread throughout the Muslims. This applies to Fadak as well, as we have covered in our Q&amp;A section of our original Fadak article. Refer to it for more on the subject. Furthermore RTS quotes narrations of the mule of the prophet (saw) being with `Ali, then after `Ali died it was with `Abdullah bin Ja`far, we ask does `Abdullah inherit `Ali? Obviously he doesn&#8217;t, `Ali&#8217;s children are the ones who are supposed to inherit him, nor do we read anything about a mule being left behind for inheritance in `Ali&#8217;s will, neither in Sunni nor Shia books. This all shows that these possessions were not inherited, rather the nation just took care of the prophet&#8217;s (saw) belongings until `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz collected them in a room for preservation, not inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">One should also take note that Ahmad ibn Hanbals authentic narration above mentions a variety of things that Alee (a.s) received from what the Prophet (saw) had left behind, to which Abbas also wanted a share. The narration does not reveal what those things were, but from the continuous dispute of Abbas in front of Aboo Bakr, Umar and Uthman we can safely assume what was left was worthy enough to dispute about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has been explained in detail in our Fadak article. We point our readers to it for the sake of time, and in fear of repetition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>D- Abu Tufail’s Fadak Narration</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated to us Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Shayba and I heard it from Abdullah ibn Abi Shayba too who said: Narrated to us Fudhayl from Al-Waleed ibn Jumai from Abil Tufayl who said: When the Messenger of Allah (saw) died, Faatima (s.a) sent word to Aboo Bakr saying: &#8220;Have you inherited from the Messenger of Allah(saw) or his family?&#8221; He said: &#8220;No, rather his family.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then where is the share of the Messenger of Allah (saw)?&#8221; Aboo Bakr said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah (saw) say: &#8216;If Allah (swt) grants some wealth to a Prophet, then takes his soul, He grants it to the one who takes charge after him.&#8217; So I have decided to give the benefit of it to the Muslims.&#8221; She said: &#8220;You and what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (saw) know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">This has been explained in detail in our Fadak article. We point our readers to it for the sake of time, and in fear of repetition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">In short, the narration, even though Hasan, contradicts the Saheeh narrations in the subject in more than one area. A Hasan Hadith cannot be accepted if found contradicting a Sahih, this narration not only has one &#8220;Saduq&#8221; narrator, it has two Saduq narrators, making it lesser than the usual &#8220;Hasan&#8221; Hadith, on top of it abu al-Tufayl was 8 years of age when the Prophet (saw) passed away, making him 8 years of age when he heard of this event, so it&#8217;s possible that he misunderstood a word or narrated from his understanding rather than the accurate word for word narrative found in the Hadith of the senior companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">E- Was Fatima angry with Abu Bakr until her Death?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though this narration can be found in the Saheehain, some scholars, like Al-Bayhaqi, have suggested that the anger of Fatima was only ascribed to her by Al-Zuhri, who never witnessed these events. Sunni scholars argued that even though the hadith can be found in the Saheehain, it was narrated in disconnected form, which causes it to fall outside the conditions of the authors of the Saheehain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, RTS has argued that this conclusion is false:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">In the science of Hadeeth Idraaj (interpolation) takes places when a sub narrator gives his opinion in the narration. Thus the words &#8220;Faatima (s.a), the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (saw) got angry and stopped speaking to Aboo Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died&#8230;&#8221; are said to be the words of Zuhri. Therefore, we should find the masculine arabic term (قال ‚&#8217;He said&#8230;&#8217;) as opposed to  (قالت  &#8216;She said&#8230;&#8217; ) contained within the narration. Let us examine if these words are from A&#8217;isha or Zuhri.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They continued:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Bayhaqi said that the Idraaj (interpolation) of the narration, is from the point of the text, &#8220;And she lived for&#8230;&#8221; till the the remainder of the text. However, these words appear after &#8220;Faatima (s.a), the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (saw) got angry and stopped speaking to Aboo Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died.&#8221; This shows that this is clearly not the opinion of Zuhri as claimed by Al-Bayhaqi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The only subnarrator that has narrated it from ibn Shahab Al-Zuhri with the addition of the word قال (he said) is Mo&#8217;ammar, but we also found that he has narrated it also as قالت (she said) elsewhere, i.e. She said (A&#8217;isha) said: &#8220;Faatima (s.a) was angered&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS then provide narration with the words “she said” in order to prove that it was indeed A’isha who said these things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly: The narration of Ma’amar from Al-Zuhri by Al-Marwazi. RTS provided a chain from Al-Marwazi, from Ibn Zanjawaih, from Abd Al-Razaq from Ma’amar from Al-Zuhri. This chain is authentic. However, it contradicts what we find in Musanaf Abd Al-Razzaq itself #9774, in which we find the words “he said,” implying Al-Zuhri. The same is found through Abdullah bin Mohammad from Hisham from Ma’amar in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #6230, and Mustakhraj Abi Awana #5376 through two chains from Abd Al-Razzaq from Ma’amar. It is safe to say that what we find in Al-Marwazi’s book is an error by either the author, Ibn Zanjawaih, or a scribe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly: The narration of Saleh bin Kaisan from Al-Zuhri by Al-Bukhari and Musnad Ahmad. The narration of Saleh does not attribute the anger of Fatima until her death to Al-Zuhri, but mentions it as a continuous report. It does not include the terms “he said” or “she said” at that point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly: The narration of Uqail from Al-Zuhri in Musnad Ahmad. Like the previous narration, we find it as a continuous report. However, RTS failed to mention that Saheeh Muslim #2713 includes the words “he said,” implying that it is an addition by Al-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourthly: The narration of Shoiab from Al-Zuhri. Like the previous two cases, we find it as a continuous report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifthly: The narration of Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Muslim from Al-Zuhri. Like the previous cases, we find it as a continuous report. However, Mohammad bin Abdullah is weakened by many scholars, and we do not see his narration as binding evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixthly: The narration of Al-Waleed bin Mohammad from Al-Zuhri. Like the previous cases, we find it as a continuous report. However, Al-Waleed bin Mohammad is extremely weak and we don’t find his narrations as binding evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS conclude:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">As evidenced, the objection that those words are actually the words of Al-Zuhri and not A&#8217;isha is rather baseless. The one chain through Mo&#8217;ammar does not stand a chance against the other five Saheeh chains narrated by Al-Zuhri. Even so, the one chain through Mo&#8217;ammar has also been narrated in another form which clearly shows that those words do indeed belong to A&#8217;isha.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We choose to stick to the view of Al-Bayhaqi and reject the conclusion provided by RTS. We hold the view that none of the narrations include the words “she said” except for one narration attributed to Ma’amar, which we believe is a mistake, as we have proven above. Out of the four reliable narrators from Al-Zuhri, we find that Ma’amar’s narration has without a doubt used the words “he said,” while Shoaib’s and Saleh’s narrations do not include this narration. Uqail’s narration has one version that supports the narration of Ma’amar, even though there are conflicting narrations from Uqail that suggest that he narrated it as a continuous narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we know from the methodologies of the early hadith scholars in accepting the additions of reliable narrators, if one Hafiz narrates an addition, it is seen as acceptable. This is the case with Ma’amar, who is one of the strongest students of Al-Zuhri. Plus, it is supported by one of the narrations of Uqail, and we do not believe that it was a coincidence that it was attributed to Uqail with the same version that it was attributed to Al-Zuhri unless it was truly narrated by Al-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS then chose to play another game. They submit that the attribution of the addition to Al-Zuhri is accurate for the sake of the argument, but then suggest that disconnected narrations by Al-Zuhri are reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS first bring evidences for the reliability of the disconnected narrations of the Tabi’een by quoting Ibn Hajar and Mulla Ali Qari. We have refuted these two quotes in part one of our article, so there is no need to repeat ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, they quote the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Khatib Al-Baghdadi:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Yaqoob ibn Sufyan said: I heard Ja&#8217;far ibn Abd Al-Waheed Al-Hashimi saying to Ahmad ibn Salih that Yahya ibn Sa&#8217;eed said: &#8220;The Mursal (hurried) of Al-Zuhri is unreliable.&#8221; Ahmad got angry and said: &#8220;What does Yahya know about the knowledge of Zuhri? That which Yahya said is untrue!&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Kifaya. Pg. # 386.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ja’afar bin Abd Al-Wahid Al-Hashimi is a liar. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS continue to explain the concept of idraaj and how all mudraj reports are to be accepted in Saheeh Al-Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The criticism of Zuhri has been recorded in Tarikh Kabir of Bukhari. However, despite this, Bukhari still deemed him as proof to have recorded from him in his authentic works. Al-Bukhari, being a hadeeth scientist himself would have undoubtedly taken Zuhri&#8217;s Idraaj in to consideration before including it into his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; (Authentic) collection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is false. Al-Bukhari has mentioned disconnected reports in his book. Are those to be accepted as reliable as well? Al-Bukhari has referred to his book as Al-Jami’ Al-Saheeh Al-Musanad min hadeethi Rasoolillah, implying that the connected reports to the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) are authentic. This does not apply to narrations of the sahaba or tabi’een, or disconnected reports, which is why scholars have never made a big deal out of criticizing such reports, even though they are very obviously weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Having said that, the Idraaj from Al-Zuhri, is of the permissible type whereby he added his explanation of the Ghareeb words contained in the hadeeth. Thus, it is correct to say, to add something from oneself in the text of a hadeeth is Haraam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are not talking about the permissibility of explaining a narration, but rather, whether such additions are seen as binding evidence or not. In this case, it is not, since it isn’t simply an explanation of terms of a hadith, but a recounting of an actual historic event, which is not based on an eye-witness account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carrying on, RTS provide an addition narration in which Fatima dies angry with Abu Bakr and Omar. RTS quote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Alee ibn Isa from Abdul Wahab ibn Ata from Muhammad ibn Amr from Abi Salama from Abi Huraira who said: Faatima (s.a) came to Aboo Bakr and Umar and she asked to give her, her share of inheritance from the Messenger of Allah (saw). They both said: We heard the Messenger of Allah (saw) saying: &#8220;I do not leave property to be inherited.&#8221; She (s.a) said: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! I will not talk to you both forever.&#8221; And then she died and did not speak with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narration has been graded Saheeh (Authentic) by Al-Albani. Aboo Isa has added the meaning of &#8220;I will not talk to you both&#8221; is that I will not talk to you about this property forever, you both are right. And this Hadeeth (i.e. I do not leave property&#8230;) is narrated in another form from Aboo Bakr from the Messenger of Allah (saw).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Albani is referring to two different narrations that he strengthened due to their agreement in the content attributed to the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). However, the second narration, which is our focus, is the only one that includes that Fatima swore to not talk to them forever. The second narration, which includes this addition, only comes to us through the path of Ali bin Eisa, who is Al-Bazzar Al-Baghdaadi. He was not known by the scholars of hadith and Al-Khateeb in his History of Baghdaad is not sure if he is the shaikh of Al-Sami or another anonymous shaikh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carrying on, RTS demonstrate their shamelessness by using double standards. They argue:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The Nawasib also seek to suggest Aboo Bakr spoke to Bibi Faatima (s.a) on her deathbed until she (s.a) was pleased with him. Why would the need to seek the pleasure of Sayeda Faatima (s.a) arise if she (s.a) was not angry with Aboo Bakr and had agreed to the verdict of the two? Or was it that she considered them to be non-Muslim as she remained angry for all those days?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Bayhaqi:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Shu&#8217;ba: When Faatima (s.a) became ill, Aboo Bakr came to her and asked for permission to enter. So Alee (a.s) said, &#8220;O Faatima (s.a)! This is Aboo Bakr asking for permission to enter.&#8221; She answered, &#8220;Do you want me to give him permission?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So she allowed him (to enter), and he (Aboo Bakr) came in seeking her pleasure, so he told her: &#8220;By Allah (swt)! I only left my home and property and my family seeking the pleasure of Allah (swt) and His Messenger (saw) and you, O Ahlulbayt (a.s).&#8221; So he talked to her (s.a) until she was pleased with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Sunan Al-Bayhaqi. Vol. # 6, Pg. # 30.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Also recorded in Al-Bayhaqi Al-Sunan Al-Kubra, Dala&#8217;il Al-Nubuwwa. It is narrated with a good (Hasan) chain. Muhibb Al-Din Al-Khatib in Al-Riyad Al-Nadira. And Dhahabi has said concerning this narration in Siyar A&#8217;lam Al-Nubala</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Note: Al-Bayhaqi, ibn Kathir, and ibn Hajar all authenticate this hadeeth and ibn Kathir states it as Saheeh in his Al-Bidayah and ibn Hajar in his Fath Al-Bari has said the mursal of Shu&#8217;ba is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">On the other hand, we find other Scholars disregarding the Mursal of Shu&#8217;ba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice how RTS recently suggested that all disconnected narrations are acceptable, and they did this by quoting Ibn Hajar and Mulla Ali Qari, but now went against this view, since it conflicts with their goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ijli explained: The mursal of Al-Sha’abi is authentic; he barely narrates disconnected narrations unless they were saheeh. See Ma’rifat Al-Thiqat by Al-Ijli.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are not quoting these words in order to suggest that disconnected reports are binding upon Muslims, but rather, that there are degrees within disconnected reports, and that some disconnected reports are stronger than others. We are also pointing this out in order to show the deception and inconsistency of RTS, for they are switching their stances on disconnected reports in order to establish their arguments. We, on the other hand, accept disconnected reports as having weakness, even though we admit that there are degrees of weakness within them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: RTS are so incompetent that they refer to the famous Tabi’ee Imam `Amir Al-Sha’bi as &#8220;Al-Shu’ba&#8221;, as you all know Shu`bah bin Hajjaj is a completely different person but RTS has no idea what they&#8217;re copying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS then argue:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">To bear a grudge for such a long period of time proves Faatima (s.a) did not consider them to be Muslim during that time period. And it is not permitted for a Muslim to be angry with another Muslim for more than three days!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (saw) said, &#8220;Do not hate one another, and do not be jealous of one another, and do not desert each other, and O Allah&#8217;s (saw) worshipers! Be brothers. Lo! It is not permissible for any Muslim to desert (not talk to) his brother (Muslim) for more than three days!&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Saheeh Al-Bukhari. Pg. # 1519, H. # 6065.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a foolish argument by RTS. Firstly, the daughter of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) was not a man to socialize with other men, in order for one to assume that she deserted them. Fatima only approached them as the official government, not as a group of friends that she used to “hang out” with. Secondly, deserting a Muslim is not a form of takfeer upon them. Thirdly, even for the sake of the argument that Abu Bakr stole the land of Fatima, it does not take him outside the fold of Islam, so to assume that this is takfeer is non-sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">F- Fadak in Shia Narrations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS provided two narrations that support their fictitious retelling of the Fadak story. However, both narrations are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first comes from the Tafseer of Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Qummi, which was falsely attributed to its author. See Buhooth fi Ilm Al-Rijal p. 428. The book was criticized for the anonymity of the author. We at twelvershia.net have another problem with the book, which is that it is filled with authentic narrations that support that idea that the Qur’an has been tampered with. Perhaps RTS supports this view, which is why they would champion this book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other book is the book of Sulaym bin Qais, which we have discussed in the first part of this refutation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">G- Aboo Bakr and Umar order Khalid to assassinate Alee (a.s)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS quote the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Aboo Bakr Al-Khallal:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated to me Muhammd ibn Alee from Al-Athram who said: I heard Aba Abdullah (i.e. Ahmad ibn Hanbal) when the hadeeth of Uqail from Al-Zuhri from Urwa from A&#8217;isha from the Prophet (saw) was mentioned to him about Alee (a.s) and Al-Abbas, and from Uqail from Al-Zuhri that Aba Bakr ordered Khalid about Alee (a.s), Aboo Abdullah said: &#8220;How?&#8221; When he understood it, he said: &#8220;I do not like to write down Hadeeth like this.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">Footnote: The chain to Ahmad is Saheeh (Authentic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Sunnah of Aboo Bakr Al-Khallal. Vol. 3, Pg. # 505</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They then state:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">We see how Ahmad ibn Hanbal chooses to ignore the narrations regarding this incident, and how the truth is hidden on disagreements between the Sahaba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">This example, and what we have evidenced makes it crystal clear that in order to find out the truth from the books of the so-called &#8216;Ahl ul Sunnah,&#8217; one must not accept blindly what is narrated but dig deeper and search very carefully to join all the pieces of the puzzle together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted that the narration is disconnected, since we do not know who narrated this hadith from Uqail. This is clear from the chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahmad’s attitudes towards these fabrications are common in both the Sunni and Shia schools. Sunnis do have the freedom of choice as to whether to write fabrications. Shias too have turned a blind eye to narrations that they deemed as fabrications, which is why we barely see any narrations in praise of the companions of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) in their books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">H- Did Alee (a.s) Anger Faatima (s.a)?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The famous narration that documents this event is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Abul Yamaan from Shu&#8217;aib from Al-Zuhri from Alee ibn Al-Hussain from Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: Alee (a.s) demanded the hand of the daughter of Aboo Jahl. Faatima (s.a) heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters. Alee (a.s) is now going to marry the daughter of Aboo Jahl.&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) got up after his recitation of Tashahhud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Aboo Al-As bin Al-Rabi (the husband of Zaynab, the daughter of the Prophet (saw) before Islam) and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Faatima (s.a) is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah (swt)! The daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) and the daughter of Allah&#8217;s (swt) enemy cannot be the wives of one man.&#8221; So Alee (a.s) gave up that engagement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Saheeh Al-Bukhari. Pg. # 917, H. # 3769.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS comment:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">As recorded in Bukhari and many other books of our opponents, the Prophet (saw) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The Messenger of Allah (saw) said: &#8220;Faatima (s.a) is part of me, whoever angers her, angers me.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The Nawasib have attempted throughout history to attribute the merits of Ahlubayt (a.s) to their enemies and the vilifications of their enemies to them. Among the many fabricated stories told against Imam Alee (a.s) was that he had asked for Aboo Jahl&#8217;s (the chief of infidels) daughter&#8217;s hand in marriage. When this news reached Sayeda Faatima (s.a), she rushed to her father who found out the falsity of the story and thus the Prophet (saw) said these words. The aim of fabricating this story was to divert the attention from the people who in reality angered Sayeda Faatima (s.a), and put Imam Alee (a.s) under the spotlight as the one who did so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They provide the following reasons for weakening the narration of Miswar bin Makhrama, yet most of these arguments are irrelevant:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">•    Al-Miswar mentions that at the time when the Prophet (saw) narrated the hadeeth in the Masjid, he was Muhtalim (i.e. impure as a result of wet dreams, or nocturnal emissions), which evidences the fact he had already reached the age of puberty, yet he was present in the Masjid in such an impure state!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS are ignorant that the term Muhtalim refers to an age group, not a person in a greater state of impurity. See Tahtheeb Al-Lugha 1/908. More importantly, even if we accepted that he was in such a state, it is not evidence to reject his narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• The hadeeth through Alee ibn Al-Hussain (a.s) from Al-Miswar contains the story of the sword, which does not make any sense, and the efforts of commentators like ibn Hajar to make sense out of that nonsense is helpless.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS are purposefully being vague by not providing why the story of the sword does not make any sense. Even if RTS do not understanding Al-Miswar’s rationality behind his words, it is not enough to reject his narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• The hadeeth through ibn Al-Zubayr is apparently taken from Al-Miswar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No proofs are provided to support this claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• The hadeeth through ibn Abi Mulaika from Al-Miswar contains the story of Banu Hisham ibn Al-Mughira asking the Prophet (saw) for permission to marry their daughter off to Imam Alee (a.s), but the other versions do not mention that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We do not see how this contradicts the narration. It is only natural for the family of the daughter of Abu Jahl (or any family) to ask the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) if he is alright with daughter being a second wife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Some versions do not mention the story of the proposal, only the part that the Prophet(saw) says that &#8220;Faatima (s.a) is part of me…&#8221; is mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This does not weaken the longer version since narrators sometimes shorten hadiths. RTS needs to provide evidence that the longer version is fabricated for us to accept their claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• The Prophet (saw) mentions one of his Mushrik son-in-laws and praises him by saying, &#8220;I married one of my daughters to Aboo Al-As bin Al- Rabi and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me,&#8221; hence what is being proposed is that Alee (a.s) was not as such.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Al-Aas is a known convert to Islam. As for the praise towards Abu Al-Aas, then it is unconnected to Ali, and it is only RTS’ understanding that everything in Sunni Hadith is a hint against Ali is their own problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• The Prophet (saw) knew what Alee (a.s) is doing is Halaal, thus he says: &#8220;I do not make anything lawful, unlawful&#8230;&#8221; yet contrary to this statement, he (saw) forbids it for Imam Alee (a.s)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scholars have provided explanations that include the view that he did not literally declare it as haram, but only condemned it, in order to preserve the feelings of his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Aboo Hanifa finds narrating this incident as an insult to Imam Alee (a.s). So how is it possible that the grandson of Imam Alee (a.s), Alee ibn Al-Hussain (a.s) narrates this story proudly and does not see it as an insult to his grandfather?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration is an everlasting merit for Fatima, when on the other hand; it is only a temporary condemnation of Ali. This is clear especially since we know that Ali let go of the idea of marrying the daughter of Abi Jahl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> RTS then provide another argument. They quoted Ibn Hajar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Ibn Hajar:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Hadeeth of Al-Miswar and Marwan was mentioned before in two forms from Al-Zuhri and it was mentioned at the beginning of the book of Al-Shurut, under the story of the peace treaty of Al-Hudaibiyya that Al-Zuhri has narrated it from Urwa from Al-Miswar and Marwan from the companions of the Prophet (saw), so it becomes obvious that in other places where it doesn&#8217;t mention, &#8220;from the companions of the Prophet (saw),&#8221; that it is in Mursal form because Miswar was younger than that to have witnessed the occasion, and Marwan is younger than him. Yes, Miswar was at an age to be able to discern in the occasion of Hunain, and he has memorized the story of proposal of Alee (a.s) to the daughter of Abi Jahl which happened around that time. Allah (swt) knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Fath Ul-Bari Fi Sharh Saheeh Al-Bukhari. Vol. 9, Pg. # 432.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They then commented:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">It is interesting how ibn Hajar says that Al-Miswar was younger than that to be able to have witnessed and understood the story of Hudaibiyya by himself and that he rather heard it from other companions of the Prophet (saw), but two years later he was mature enough to discern all things on the occasion of Hunain in the 8th year after Hijra and the story of the proposal of Imam Alee (a.s) to the daughter Abi Jahl around that time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">We ask, what was his criteria and tool to conclude this and make it a fact?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Hajar gives his reasons. He said that Al-Miswar narrated a narration from Sulh Al-Hudaibiya through other companions, while he did not do the same with the narration about the daughter of Abu Jahl incident. It seems that RTS did not understand what they were quoting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS do not provide any other reasons to reject the narration other than point to scans that state that he was eight years old at the time. As we all know, it is fine to narrate as such an age, and Shias do accept this since they accept that Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain were both younger than Al-Miswar, and yet, they narrated from the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS also seem to suggest that Al-Miswar could not have been a muhtalim while being only eight years old. However, as Ibn Hajar said, this could be understood as a metaphor for one who is young but has the ability to discern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Ibn Al-Zubair, RTS attempted his character by quoting this tradition:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Baladhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">And narrated to me Hisham ibn Ammar saying: Narrated Al-Zubayri from Al-Zuhri that he said: One of the biggest issues that Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr is criticised for is that he left mentioning the Messenger of Allah (saw) in his sermons, and that when he was criticised for it, he said: He has a bad family that when he is mentioned, they become proud of themselves and raise their necks because of his name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Ansaab Al-Ashraaf. Vol. 7, Pg. # 2857.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chain is weak since Hisham bin Ammar says, “I was told that Al-Zubayri said.” RTS mistranslated this, perhaps purposefully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS did also ask a group of questions that need to be dealt with:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Al-Miswar was eight years old when the Prophet (saw) died, which means that he was around six years old when the story of the proposal happened.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• How did he perceive the story with such precision and then memorise the hadeeth of the Prophet (saw) at the age of six?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS is suggesting that this narration is disconnected and we have quoted the words of Ibn Hajar that it is indeed a connected narration. However, even if we assumed that it is disconnected, we accept this narration since it is a disconnected narration by a companion of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), and the majority of the scholars of hadith, if not all of them, accept these types of narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, RTS is now complaining about this being disconnected, when he only recently argued for the acceptability of the disconnected narrations of Al-Zuhri, who died in the year 125 AH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• How could he then be in a state of nocturnal emission at the age of six?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has been explained above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Ibn Al-Zubayr was also four months older than Al-Miswar, so how is it possible that it was only these two six years old companions who heard the story and no one from among the elder companions heard it and witnessed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Is it a coincidence that only these two companions who are famous in their enmity towards Ahlulbayt (a.s) witnessed the occasion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No. The Sunni view is that many people heard this tradition. However, unlike most traditions, we have only received them from a few eye witnesses. As most of us are aware, the sermons of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) are all heard by large quantities of people, and yet, it is rare when these narrations reach us in many chains going back to several companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Ibn Zubayr&#8217;s enmity is clear towards the Ahlulbayt (a.s) since he fought against Imam Alee (a.s) in the battle of Jamal. He also possessed enmity towards his children after him, to the extent that he did not mention the name of the Prophet (saw) in his sermons and send blessings upon him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Al-Miswar was also his sidekick and a person who was praised, respected and obeyed by the Khawarij who declared Imam Alee (a.s) a Kafir. One must question how that could be possible except that he possessed enmity towards Alee (a.s).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Al-Miswar would praise and send blessings upon Mu&#8217;awiyah whenever his name was mentioned. Is it simply a coincidence that Al-Miswar always was to the side with the enemies of Imam Alee (a.s)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• How can a story be accepted from an enemy?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has been responded to above. Furthermore, Ibn Al-Zubair’s relationship with Ali did not prevent him from narrating this major merit of Fatima.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">• Is it a coincidence that only these two harsh enemies of Alee (a.s) heard this story and that both of them were very close friends?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one possibility. The other possibility, which is suggest by Al-Tirmithi and Al-Bazzar is that this is a mistake by Isma’eel bin Ulaya, who attributed this narration accidentally to Ibn Mulaika from Ibn Al-Zubair, when Ibn Mulaika only narrated it from Al-Miswar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both are very possible and it seems that Al-Tirmithi didn’t want to argue for the weakness of the hadith of Ibn Al-Zubair due to the strength of Ibn Ulaya, even though the majority of narrators attributed it to Al-Miswar alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">When we take all these facts into consideration, we can easily conclude that this story is a myth created by the Nawasib, narrated by the Nawasib, justified by the Nawasib, promoted by the Nawasib and used by the Nawasib at present to degrade the Messenger of Allah (saw), Imam Alee (a.s) and the chief of the ladies of Paradise, Faatima (s.a), only to save the reputation of Aboo Bakr and Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We respond to this allegation with another authentic narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Ahmad narrated in his Fadha’il 2/946 from Sufyan (bin Uyayna) from Amr (bin Dinar) from Mohammad bin Ali (Al-Baqir) that: Ali (as) wanted to get married to the daughter of Abi Jahl. The Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said while on the pulpit, “Ali wanted to marry Al-Awra’a bint Abi Jahl, and it is not to him to gather between the daughter of the enemy of Allah and the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, and Fatima is a piece of me.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps RTS will also suggest that Al-Baqir was an enemy of Ali next.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We would also like to suggest that RTS turn its back to the narration that says that, “Whoever angers Fatima angers me,” since this narration only comes through these paths that RTS is discrediting. If RTS were to do this, then they should drop their case against Abu Bakr altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">I- Umar Attacks the Houses of the Wives of the Prophet (saw)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this section, RTS goes out of his way in order to prove that Omar had an aggressive nature towards women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Muhammad Ibn Sa’d:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Uthman ibn Umar from Younis ibn Yazid from Al-Zuhri from Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mosayyib who said: When Aboo Bakr died, A&#8217;isha held a mourning gathering in which eulogies had been read for him, Umar was informed of it, so he forbid them [the mourners] from doing so. They refused, so he said to Hisham ibn Al-Walid: &#8220;Bring out for me the daughter of Abi Qohafa (sister of Abi Bakr)!&#8221; Then he lashed her, and when the mourners heard this they escaped, and he said: &#8220;Do they want to punish Aboo Bakr by their weeping?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (saw) said: &#8220;The dead man suffers when his family weep for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir. Vol. 3, Pg. # 191.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps RTS should have changed the name of the article to “Merits of Omar” for finding and introducing to us this marvellous narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find that in this narration the great love that Omar have for Abu Bakr. We also find that Omar believed that Abu Bakr would be tormented by the loud weeping and wailing of his family. This shows that he believed in the prophetic narration, which goes against the Shia claim that he was an unbeliever. Secondly, the narration shows that Omar believed that Abu Bakr was a good believer, which caused him to try to prevent any punishment from occurring onto him. For if he believed that Abu Bakr was to be punished for his “injustice” towards Ahl Al-Bayt, then preventing the weeping of family members wouldn’t have made a difference. Thirdly, Omar was the ruler at the time, which allows him to enter upon whomever he wills in order to prevent what is haram. Perhaps RTS would suggest that if a couple were fornicating, then the ruler is supposed to wait until they are done, then to ask them nicely to come outside for their punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS then quote a similar narration about Khalid bin Al-Waleed and we simply repeat what we have said above since it is a very similar story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, our objectivity prevents us from totally accepting these merits since both narrations are disconnected. Both Sa’eed and Amr were not eye witnesses of the incidents since they were born way after these incidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">J- Umar Threatens To Burn His Son&#8217;s House Down</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another misinterpreted merit of Omar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Abi Shaybah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Aboo Bakr from Ya&#8217;laa ibn Ubayd from Fudhayl ibn Ghazwan from Nafi&#8217; from ibn Umar who said: Umar was informed that one of his sons has covered the walls of his house with cloth, so he said: &#8220;By Allah (swt!) If that is true, I will burn his house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narration is Saheeh (Authentic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah. Vol. 8, Pg. # 360, H. # 25744.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Omar bin Al-Khattab was known for his asceticism. This led him to harshness even amongst his own children who would seek worldly pleasure, like decorating their houses. Are these threats the threats of a disbeliever? Or are they the words of someone who feared Allah and wanted the mercy of Allah for his family?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, we find in the Saheehain from the Hadiths of Abu Huraira #186 and Ibn Abbas #187 that a person who thinks about committing a sin, but does not commit it, will not have it held against him, nor will it be written as a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be known that there is another narration, in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5808, in which Ali angers Fatima. The narration is from Sahl bin Sa’ad, who then states that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) saw Ali sleeping in the Masjid, with dust all over him. He then referred to him as Abu Turab. In other words, this narration is treated as a merit for Ali, even though he angered Fatima.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #000080;">K- Umar Burns the House of a Companion of the Prophet (saw)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The merits continue:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Abd Al-Razzaq:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Abd Al-Razzaq narrated Ubaydullah ibn Umar and Ma&#8217;mar from Nafi narrated Safiyyah ibn Abi Ubayd: Umar discovered alcohol in the house of a man from (the tribe of) Thaqif. He (the man) had already been lashed for alcohol consumption in the past. Therefore, he (Umar) burnt his house, and asked, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; He (the man) replied, &#8220;Ruwayshid.&#8221; He (Umar) retorted, &#8220;Rather, you are Fuwaysiq (an abusive word).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Musannaf Abd Al-Razzaq. Vol. 6, Pg. # 77, H. # 10051.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps we shall employ some of the RTS people in order to write our articles in the future, for this narration shows that Omar was harshly against the selling of alcohol, due to its prohibition. Once again, we ask, are these the actions of a disbeliever? Or are they are the actions of a man that wants the best for the Ummah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: RTS are so incompetent that they refer to one of the sources that narrates this event as “Al-Kuni,” when it is in actuality “Al-Kuna.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>L- Aboo Bakr Orders To Burn the House of the Wife of the Prophet Muhammad (saw)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS quote a narration in which Abu Bakr wants to burn the house of woman who was thought to be a wife of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). He wanted to burn her house because she apostated. Omar then told Abu Bakr that she was never his wife in the first place. Strangely, we do not know what led RTS to the conclusion that she was indeed the wife of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) for them to make such a foolish claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Either way, the narration is weak since it contains Hussain bin Abi Ma’shar. See his biography in Mizan Al-I’itidal or Lisan Al-Mizan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And peace be upon Muhammad our master and his family and followers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The following is a response to RevisitingtheSalaf.org’s article “The Oppression of Sayeda Fatima (s.a) Part VII-I.” The article was published on the 19th of June, 2014, and can be found (<span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://www.revisitingthesalaf.org/2014/06/the-oppression-of-sayeda-faatima-sa_2037.html" rel="external nofollow">here.</a>)</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has taken seven irrelevant articles to finally get here, but RTS have finally made it. Finally, they have chosen to write an article discussing the various aspects of the narrations that suggest that Fatima’s house was burned down and that her ribs were broken. However, we suggest renaming the article to something more fitting, like “The Oppression of the Visitors of RevisitingTheSalaf.org” due to the unnecessary length of the article.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jokes aside, and in typical fashion, the twelvershia.net team will respond to all the relevant evidences, swiftly and painlessly.<br />
Before even getting to the rebuttal, we would like to point out the first mistranslation that we found in the narration of Saqeefa that was quoted by RTS.<br />
The narration says:<br />
خالف عنا علي والزبير<br />
The narration simply says that Ali and Al-Zubair were not present with them. It does not mean that they “opposed us.” RTS, may have purposefully mistranslated this in order to suggest ill will between these parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be aware that in our refutation, we will only be focusing on refuting the relevant material. RTS are infamous for getting sidetracked into discussing issues that are not related to the actual events of the broken rib/burned house.<br />
The topics will be discussed in this refutation will be the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Was the House of Fatima Burned?<br />
&#8211; Did Imam Alee (a.s) give Allegiance Instantly?<br />
&#8211; The Breaking of Zubayrs Sword<br />
&#8211; Shia Narrations from the Book of Sulaym bin Qais<br />
&#8211; The Existence of Hadhrat Mohsin<br />
&#8211; Shia Narrations about the Burning of the House</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Was the House of Fatima Burned?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- The narration of Ibn Abd Rabbih in Al-Iqd Al-Fareed: RTS are extremely ignorant for bringing this narration as evidence. Firstly, the narration does not suggest that the house was burned. On the contrary, RTS left out that Ali comes out of the house and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr right then and there. So, the very narration that RTS quoted goes against the silly suggestion that the house was burned and that Fatima’s ribs were broken.<br />
However, being the objective researchers that we are, we need to point out that the narration is disconnected since the author died in the fourth century and did not witness these events. Therefore, we class this narration as weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- The narration of Abul Fida Imad Al-Deen Isma’eel bin Alee in Al-Mukhtasar fi Akbar Al-Bashr: This narration is the same as the previous one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author says right after quoting the narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">كذا نقله القاضي جمال الدين بن واصل، وأسنده إلى ابن عبد ربه المغربي<br />
Translation: That is how Al-Qadhi Jamal Al-Deen bin Wasil quoted and attributed it to Ibn Abd Rabbih Al-Maghribi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- The narration of Al-Baladhuri in Ansab Al-Ashraf: The narration is weak due to the anonymity of Maslama bin Muharib. RTS quoted Ibn Hibban’s inclusion of this narrator in his book Al-Thiqaat, but as we have explained in previous articles, Ibn Hibban was infamous for including people that he does not know in this book. For example, in his book of trustworthy narrators, he said, “Suhail bin Amr, a shaikh that narrates from his father, and Hammam bin Yahya narrated from him. I do not know who he is nor do I know his father.”<br />
The narration is also weak due to the anonymity of the author of the book, Al-Baladhuri. Ibn Hajar included him in his book of weak narrators, Lisan Al-Mizan. We couldn’t find contemporaries and those that lived in centuries close to him anyone that has mentioned him with praise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another weakness in the narration is disconnection, since Ibn Awn died in the year 150 AH and was not an eye witness of the events.<br />
RTS have anticipated the last response above and have countered with an ironic quote from Ibn Hajar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The Mursal of Tabi&#8217;ee, if he mentioned an occasion that he was not present in, it is called Mursal, even though it is possible that he has heard it actually from a companion that has experienced the occasion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the thing is that if he has been present in its time,</strong></span> it is considered as if he actually has heard it or was present in it with the condition that he should be free of Tadlees, and Allah (swt) knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Fath Ul-Bari Fi Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari. Vol. 9, Pg. # 104 &#8211; 105.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems as though the “academics” that write for the RTS website do not even know what they are quoting. We have bolded and underlined the portion of the quote that is relevant. We find in his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb that he was born in the year 66 AH, which means that he could not have been present at the time, and thus, the quote provided by RTS is used as ammunition against them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, they have also quoted another opinion:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Mulla Alee Al-Qari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">I say: &#8220;Mursal of Al-Tabi&#8217;ee is Hujjah (proof) among the Jumhoor (majority) of scholars, let alone the Mursal of someone about whose companionship (to the Prophet (saw)) there is difference of opinion? (i.e. it is indeed Hujjah).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Mirqatul Al-Mafatih Sharh Mishkatul Masabih. Vol. 9, Pg. # 434.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mullah Ali Al-Qari seems to be referring to the opinion of the Hanafis towards Mursal narrations. For this is indeed a popular opinion within the Hanafi school. On the other hand, we find that all the scholars of Hadith and the majority of the scholars of Fiqh of other Madhabs, hold the opinion that Mursal narrations are not to be accepted (with some exception in some very specific cases). These opinions can be found in the words of Imam Muslim, Al-Tirmithi, Al-Hakim, Al-Khateeb, Ibn Abd Al-Barr, Ibn Al-Salaah, Al-Nawawi, Al-Ala’ee, and others. See Al-Hadith Al-Mursal by Hussah Al-Sagheer 2/408-410.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps though, the most ironic thing about this very narration is that Ibn Awn, is not a tabi’ee, but was rather treated as one of the atba’a al-tabi’een. See Al-Thiqaat by Ibn Hibban 3/4. Therefore, the point that the narrations of the tabi’een are seen as authentic is irrelevant, since he is of an even later level of narrators.<br />
Most importantly, even if we went against our logic and accepted the argument, we find that the narration does not say that Fatima’s house was burned, nor were her ribs broken, but that Ali came out and pledged his allegiance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- The narration of Al-Masudi in Muruj Al-Dhahab: The narration is weak since Al-Mas’udi the author was not praised by any scholar of his time. This applies to both Sunni and Shia schools of thought. RTS suggest that he was only weakened because he narrated some narrations that suggest that he was a Shi’ee. However, we maintain our position that he is more of an anonymous narrator, since we could not find scholars weakening him, nor praising him either.<br />
Plus, it should be mentioned that the father of Ibn A’isha is an anonymous narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- The narration of Al-Ayyashi in his Tafseer: RTS has quoted a Shi’ee narration that is weak, since the chain is both disconnected and from anonymous sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- The narration of Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf: The narration is weak due to disconnection between Aslam and the events of the narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS have countered with several arguments. One of them is a quote from Al-Isaba by Ibn Hajar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Aslam slave of Umar, narrated ibn Munda through Abdul Mun&#8217;em ibn Bashir from Abdul Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam from his father from his grandfather that he travelled with the Messenger of Allah (saw) in two journeys. And it is famous that Umar bought Aslam after the death of the Messenger of Allah (saw). Such is narrated by ibn Ishaq and others, we will mention him again in the third part, if God wants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Al-Isaba. Vol. 1, Pg. # 130.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not evidence, since even Ibn Hajar, who is quoting this, doubts the merits of this story. He says, “We will mention him again in the third chapter.” Ibn Hajar says in the opening of his book 1/6, “The third chapter is for those that have been mentioned in the previous books that have seen both the days of Jahiliyah and Islam, and that were not found in narrations that they have met the Prophet (salalahu alaihi salam) or seen him.” This suggests that Ibn Hajar strongly opposes the narration above, for he would have not mentioned him in this chapter if he saw it as authentic. The reason being is that this narration is by Abd Al-Mun’im bin Basheer, who was caught by Yahya bin Ma’een for fabricating narrations. See his biography in Rijal books like Mizan Al-I’itidal or Lisan Al-Mizan.<br />
Another argument provided by RTS is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Ibn Ishaq sought to testify that Umar bought Aslam during the Hajj campaign which took place in 11 A.H. However, the birth of ibn Ishaq was around 80 A.H and hence there was approximately a 70 year gap between both these personalities between when Aslam was bought and ibn Ishaq&#8217;s birth. So the question is, how did he become a witness to this? How does he constitute those years without being present? And what is his evidence to compensate for them 70 years? It is strange how the opponents find the Mursal hadeeth of Zayd ibn Aslam unacceptable when they have no problem in accepting statements made from ibn Ishaq when we see a massive gap between the lives of Aslam and ibn Ishaq. Do we not see double standards at play here?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no double standards since the narration is connected. Ibn Ishaaq narrated this from Nafi’ who heard it from Ibn Omar that Omar bought Aslam after the death of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) during the hajj. See Ma’rifat Al-Sahaba by Abu Nu’aim 1/255.<br />
The third argument provided by RTS is another that suggests the acceptability of mursal (disconnected) narrations. They argue:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"> As we have already discussed Aslam the slave of Umar, we will now analyse his son, Zayd ibn Aslam in regards to his Mursal (hurried) narrations. In the following hadeeth, Zayd bin Aslam has narrated a hadeeth which is mursal (broken) on the authority of the Prophet (saw) despite the fact he was not even born during the Prophet (saw) life, yet is still authenticated as Saheeh! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS, who has very little experience with hadith sciences, is not aware of the meaning of the words of Al-Tirmithi. What Al-Tirmithi is trying to say is that “this narration is more correct” and not “authentic”. He said that a hadith of Abd Al-Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam from his father from Ata’a from Abi Sa’eed is weaker than the narration of Abdullah bin Aslam from his father. He is implying that the narration should not be connected to Abu Sa’eed in the first place. Such matters are clear to those that are versed with hadith sciences and the science of `ilal.<br />
More importantly, even if we accepted this narration as authentic, we would have to accept that the house was not burned or the ribs of Fatima were broken, for the narration does not include that, but rather, includes that they all pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr in the end.<br />
RTS continue by quoting narrations that prohibit frightening Muslims. We agree that this is not permissible. However, it does not equate to burning down the house of Fatima, nor do we believe that RTS are satisfied with only this argument.<br />
RTS also quoted a narration that states:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Narrated Amr Al-Naqid and ibn Abi Umar from Sufyan ibn Uyayna from Ayoob from ibn Sireen from Aboo Huraira who reported: The Messenger of Allah (saw) said: &#8220;He who points a weapon towards his brother, the angels invoke curse upon him even if he is his real brother so long as he does not abandon it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Saheeh Muslim. Vol. 2, Pg. # 1211, H. # 125.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we believed that this incident occurred, then one could argue that the angels did invoke a curse, which lasted only for a short time, since everyone ended up pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr. However, we reject the narration in the first place, so we do not believe that such a curse was placed upon Omar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Did Imam Alee (a.s) give Allegiance Instantly?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two opinions are given. The first is that it was given immediately. This can be found in Mustadrak Al-Hakim #4431 that Abu Bakr said to Ali: O’ cousin of the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) did you intend to create discord between the Muslims? He said: Don’t blame O’ caliph of the Messenger of Allah (salalahu alaihi wa salam). He then pledged allegiance to him. The chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the narrations in the Saheehain have suggested that Ali only gave <em>bay’ah</em> six months later, after the death of Fatima. The narrations are clear that he gave <em>bay’ah</em> willingly and he was not threatened to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some scholars have reconciled this by either suggesting that the <em>bay’ah</em> took place twice, or that the first narration has a hidden defect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless, we find it silly that RTS would quote several narrations that Ali gave <em>bay’ah</em> during the life of Fatima, then suggest that he only gave it six months after the death of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps RTS should have a clear opinion before attempting to create doubts among both Sunni and Shia readers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The Breaking of Zubayrs Sword</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- The narration of Al-Tabari in his Tareekh: The narration is weak because it comes from the path of Ziyad bin Kulaib who is from the atba’a al-tab’ieen, which makes his narration disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- The narration of Al-Muhib Al-Tabari in Al-Riyadh: The narration is weak because it comes from the path of Al-Zuhri who is from the tabi’een, which makes his narration disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- The narration of Imam Ahmad in Al-Sunnah: See previous comments about Al-Zuhri for the first part of the narration. The second part is authentic up until Ibrahim bin Abd Al-Rahman bin Awf, who may have been too young to have seen the events of the narration, since it was said that he was an infant during the times of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). Regardless, the continuation of the narration from his pass states that Ali and Al-Zubair both say that Abu Bakr is more deserving of the caliphate than they are. See Mustadrak Al-Hakim 4396.<br />
4- The narration of Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak: Same as previous.<br />
5- The narration of Ibn Katheer in Al-Bidaya wal Nihaya: Same as previous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Shia Narrations from the Book of Sulaym bin Qais</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">RTS share their perspective on how one should view the incident of the broken rib/burned house/death of Fatima. They first choose to suggest the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">The book of Sulaym ibn Qays Al-Hilali is connected to the incidents which occurred in the early stages of Islam when the usurpation of Caliphate and the seizing of rulership took place after the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) demise. The book illustrates the lives and attitudes of the Caliphs and contains information that is unavailable in other sources. It was collected by Sulaym ibn Qays who entrusted it to Aban ibn Abi-Ayyash. The book has received endorsement from the Holy Imam (a.s).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Some have also cast doubt about the authenticity of the book. The author is regarded as trustworthy, however, Aban ibn Abi-Ayyash himself remains disputed. This caused many from the later generation to either partially or completely dismiss the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Our purpose is not to delve in to the polemics concerning the reliability of the book, rather we would like to give another perspective concerning the attack on the house of Sayeda Faatima (s.a) and the circumstances surrounding the death of the Prophet (saw). This will allow us to resolve a critical puzzle scattered in many Sunni and Shi&#8217;a books about this incident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Confusion can be found in the above statement. RTS admits that some have doubted the authenticity of the book, but yet state that the Imam has endorsed it. The latter is false and we demand RTS to provide evidence of this baseless statement.<br />
We add that Aban bin Abi Ayyash was weakened by Al-Tusi. Ibn Al-Ghadha’iri adds that the Shias suggest that he fabricated the book of Sulaym bin Qays. See Dhu’afa’a Rijal Al-Hadith 1/134.<br />
In other words, RTS is quoting narrations that are seen as fabrications, even according to the standards of Shias themselves.<br />
Al-Bahbudi comments, “There is no doubt that the book is fabricated, and there are signs that suggest this: Like that Mohammad bin Abi Bakr (who was an infant at the time) advised his father upon his deathbed and that the Imams are thirteen.” See Ma’rifat Al-Hadeeth p. 359.<br />
This is the quality of the sources that RTS uses as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sulaym bin Qays himself is unknown nor is there any mention of him or any information concerning him in the books of history or Rijal. The correct view upon research is that there was a man known as &#8220;Salm bin Qays al-Hilali&#8221; not &#8220;Sulaym&#8221;, this man was a liar who used to narrate mainly from Anas bin Malik and al-Hasan al-Basri, meaning he is a late narrator and couldn&#8217;t have narrated anything from `Ali himself. Shia scholars claimed he was a companion of `Ali and fabricated a book and attributed it to this man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The Existence of Hadhrat Mohsin (a.s)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter, RTS quote evidence of the existence of Al-Muhsin. Al-Muhsin, often seen in Shia narrations as the stillborn son of Fatima, is used as a plot device in order to inflate the tragic drama surrounding the myth of the broken rib tale.<br />
RTS then quoted the names of the Sunni scholars that suggested that Al-Mohsin died young, after birth. The list includes, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Al-Athir, Al-Muhib Al-Tabari, Al-Bakkari, Ibn Sayyid Al-Naas, Ibn Kathir, Al-Qastalani, Al-Nuwairi, Zakariya Al-Ansari, and Abu Al-Fida’a. We add to this list the name of Ibn Ishaaq (d. 150 AH), who is the Imam of the seerah, and one of the most knowledgeable people when it comes to the biographies of the companions and family of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See Al-Thuriyah Al-Tahira by Al-Dulabi p.114.<br />
RTS then mentioned the names of the scholars that believed that Al-Mohsin was a stillborn. The scholars he included in this list were Ibn Abd Al-Hadi Al-Maqdisi, Al-Mizzi, Al-Safoori, Al-Suban, Al-Hamzawi, Al-Fasi, and Al-Safadi.<br />
RTS also includes a quote from Ibn Shahr Ashoub in which he quotes Ibn Qutaibah as being from the second group of scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, what we find in his book is different, which is why we disregard it, since Ibn Shahr Ashoub is not a trusted scholar.<br />
It should also be noted that Ibn Abd Al-Hadi has two opinions and that he has included in his book the narration in which the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) named Al-Mohsin. Refer to his Nihayat Al-Maraam p.58.<br />
Now, due to the apparent difference of opinion between the scholars, we find ourselves obliged to stick with the view of the first party, for several reasons:<br />
1- They are the majority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- They are supported by a hadith, that although considered by scholars weak, is not considered a fabrication, in which the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) names Al-Mohsin, which means that he was born during his lifetime. The opposing view is not supported by weak hadiths.<br />
3- The naming of children rarely ever occurs until after birth, especially in an age in which ultrasounds did not exist.<br />
Most importantly, even if we assumed that Al-Mohsin died a stillbirth, there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that it was from any causes other than natural ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Confession of Aboo Bakr and Umar ibn Al-Khattab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">Under this lengthy chapter, RTS quotes a single narration that includes Abu Bakr saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">I wish that I would not have uncovered the house of Faatima (s.a) and left it, even if they would have closed it(to prepare) for a war!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> RTS has quoted this report from Al-Ahadith Al-Mukhtara 1/88-91 and other sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response, we simply say that the narration is weak due to the narration of Ulwan bin Dawud. He was described as munkar al-hadith by Al-Bukhari and Ibn Yunus. See Lisan Al-Mizan 4/218. Sa’eed bin Ufair, his student, referred to him as a zaaqool (a thief).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS has anticipated that we would quote the opinions of scholars that have referred to him as munkar al-hadith and have responded with the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Al-Dhahabi:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">&#8220;Not everyone who narrates munkar hadeeth is weak.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Mizan Al-I&#8217;tidal. Vol. 1, Pg. # 259.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We say in response that there is a difference between a hadith being referred to as munkar, as we find Al-Thahabi doing above, and calling a narrator munkar al-hadith, as we see in the words of Al-Bukhari and Ibn Yunus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simply put, it is the difference between calling a meal “bad” as opposed to referring to the chef as ”bad”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Bukhari himself said, “Everyone I refer to as munkar al-hadith, then it is not permissible to narrate from him.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shaikh Abd Al-Azeez Sadhan comments, “One of the harshest terms that Al-Bukhari uses in jarh and ta’deel is him saying about a narrator: Munkar al-hadith.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS though provide another argument by presenting a chain without Ulwan. They quote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Similar like this and longer than this has been (Narrated ibn Wahab &#8211; Al-Layth bin Sa&#8217;d &#8211; Saleh bin Kaysan &#8211; Hameed bin Abdul-Rahman bin Auf &#8211; Abdul Rahman bin Auf), and it is also reported by Ai&#8217;dh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Source: Tarikh Al-Islam Wa Wafiyat Ul Mashaheer Wa Al-Alam. Vol. 3, Pg. # 117 &#8211; 118</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS also comments:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">It would seem inconceivable that Layth heard the narration from Alwan from Saleh ibn Kaysan and did not enquire about it on his pilgrimage to Hajj, since Saleh ibn Kaysan was a significant scholar of Hijaz like Al-Zuhri and others and since Layth heard from these scholars, he would have undoubtedly asked Saleh ibn Kaysan regarding this specific narration too, especially with Al-Dhahabi mentioning it. In conclusion, the existence of Alwan in some chains does not affect the reliability of this narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response, we say that Al-Laith has narrated this hadith from Ulwan on at least three different occasions with the inclusion of the name of Ulwan (see next source). Therefore, it is not likely that he heard it directly from Salih bin Kaysan. This is also supported by the fact that Al-Uqaili 4/50 in his Dhua’afa’ and Al-Daraqutni in his Ilal 1/214, both stated that this is the hadith of Ulwan. In other words, they do not acknowledge it as the hadith of Al-Layth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS in a last ditch effort, quote a narration from Ansab Al-Ashraf with Al-Haytham bin Adi, who was an infamous liar, in order to strengthen the previous report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RTS furthermore provide several vague narrations in which the two caliphs express sadness and regret, wishing that they were dead. RTS suggest that this is proof that they broke Fatima’s ribs. However, we do not find any evidence of this in those narrations. It is like suggesting that Mariam the daughter of Imran must have fornicated because she expressed regret and wished death upon herself. Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says in His holy book [Surat Mariam:24]:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قَالَتْ يَا لَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَذَا وَكُنْتُ نَسْيًا مَنْسِيًّا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{She said: &#8220;I wish I had died long before this and became forgotten&#8221;}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see, there is no connection between her regret and the foolish accusation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Shia Narrations about the Burning of the House</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The article went into a downward spiral after the previous sections with RTS quoting Shia opinions and Shia narrations in order to substantiate the event. It is important to be aware that RTS was not able to provide any clear evidences from Sunni books that suggest that the event of the broken rib occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First narration by Al-Majlisi from Bihar Al-Anwar: Weak because it comes through the path of Eisa bin Al-Mustafeed, who is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri (p. 449).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second narration by Al-Ayyashi in his Tafseer: Weak because the chain is disconnected between him and Amr bin Abi Miqdam.<br />
Third narration by Al-Kulayni in Al-Kafi: The narration is authentic, but does not mention the event, nor does it mention that Abu Bakr and Omar killed Fatima. It only suggests that Fatima is a shaheed. Furthermore, Shias are all shaheed according to the Imam, as we can see in the authentic narration in Al-Kafi 8/146, even if they die on their beds. This supports the Sunni view that there are those that can be referred to as shaheed even though they did not literally die as martyrs. See Saheeh Muslim #3539. Also in al-Kafi 1/190 we read chapter called:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">في أن الأئمة شهداء الله عز وجل على خلقه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Chapter: That the Imams are Shuhada&#8217; of Allah on the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shuhahda&#8217; here means witnesses, so how do I know that Fatimah is not a Shaheedah meaning a witness of Allah on his creation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourth narration by Al-Kulayni in Al-Kafi: The narration does not mention anything about the event of the broken rib. All it mentions is the existence of Al-Mohsin and that he was named before birth. However, the chain is weak due to the anonymity of Al-Qassim bin Yahya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifth narration by Al-Kulayni in Al-Kafi: The narration does not mention anything about the event of the broken rib.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixth narration by Al-Kulayni in Al-Kafi: The narration is weak due to Al-Mu’alla bin Mohammad. See his biography in Fihrist Al-Najashi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seventh narration by Al-Kulayni in Al-Kafi: The narration is weak due to Ali bin Mohammad Al-Hirmizani. See Al-Jawahiri p. 414.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eighth narration by Al-Khudhaibi in Al-Hidaya Al-Kubra: The chain is disconnected between the author and Al-Mufadhal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ninth narration by Al-Hilli in Mukhtasar Basa’ir Al-Darajat: The chain is weak due to the anonymity of Omar bin Furat. See Al-Jawahiri p. 428.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tenth narration by Al-Mas’oudi in Ithbat Al-Wasiya: The author is anonymous which makes the narration weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleventh narration of Al-Saduq in Ilal Al-Shara’i’i: See hadith number four.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelfth narration by Al-Saduq in Al-Amali: The chain is weak due to Al-Hasan bin Ali Al-Bata’ini and his father Ali bin Abi Hamza Al-Bata’ini, as they have been deemed as liars by Shia hadith scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirteenth narration by Al-Saduq in Al-Amali: See previous comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourteenth narration by Al-Saduq in Al-Khisal: The chain is weak due to Tameem bin Bahloul, who is anonymous. See Al-Jawahiri p. 94.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifteenth narration by Ibn Quluwaih in Kamil Al-Ziyarat: The chain is weak due to Abdullah bin Bukair Al-Arjani. See Al-Jawahiri p. 327. RTS argued that the narration is authentic due to the “Kamil Al-Ziyarat rule,” which basically suggests that all the narrations in this book are from reliable narrators. We reject this rule and point out that this is an old view of Al-Khoei, but he decided that this view is false since there is no evidence by the author that he intended this. Refer to Al-Jawahiri’s introduction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sixteenth narration by Ibn Quluwaih in Kamil Al-Ziyarat: The chain is weak due to Abdullah bin Abd Al-Rahman Al-Asam. See Al-Jawahiri p. 338.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seventeenth narration by Al-Khazzaz in Kifayat Al-Athar: The chain is weak due to Abdullah bin Dahir. See Al-Jawahiri p. 333.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eighteenth narration by Al-Tabari Al-Imami in Dala’il Al-Imamah: The chain is weak due to Abd Al-Rahman bin Bahr who is anonymous. See Al-Jawahiri p. 308.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nineteenth narration by Al-Tabari Al-Imami in Dala’il Al-Imamah: The chain is weak due to Al-Hassan bin Basheer who is anonymous. See Al-Jawahiri p. 136.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twentieth narration by Al-Tabari Al-Imami in Dala’il Al-Imamah: The chain is weak due to Mohammad bin Ahmad bin Abi Abdullah who is anonymous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-first narration by Al-Tabari Al-Imami in Dala’il Al-Imamah: The chain is weak due to Ali bin Omar bin Hasan and Ja’afar bin Mohammad, who are both anonymous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-second narration by Al-Mufeed in Al-Ikhtisaas: The narration is weak due to disconnection and because the grandfather of Amr is unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-third narration by Al-Mufeed in Al-Ikhtisaas: The narration is weak by Al-Arjani and Al-Asam. The chain was discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-fourth narration by Al-Mufeed in Al-Amali: The chain is weak because of Sa’eed bin Ufair who is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 251.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-fifth narration by Al-Mufeed in Al-Amali: The chain is weak due to Eisa bin Mihran who is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 449.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-sixth narration by Al-Murtadha in Al-Shafi: The chain is weak due to the anonymity of Ahmad bin Amr Al-Bajali. See Al-Jawahiri p. 36.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-seventh narration by Al-Tusi in his Mukhtasar Al-Shafi: See previous narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-eighth narration by Al-Tusi in Al-Amali: The chain is weak due to Ikrimah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-ninth narration by Al-Karajki in Kanz Al-Fawa’id: The chain is weak due to the weakness of Al-Mufadhal bin Omar, who died as a Al-Khattabi (a follower heretical sect). He was weakened by Al-Kashshi, Al-Najashi, and Ibn Al-Ghadha’iri, and there is an authentic narration in Al-Kashshi where the Imam cursed him. See Dhu’afa’a Al-Ruwat by Ibrahim Shaboot p. 563.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirtieth narration by Al-Tabrasi in Al-Ihtijaaj: The narration is weak due to disconnection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirty-first narration by Ibn Tawus in Muhj Al-Da’awaat: The narration makes no mention of the killing of Fatima or of the event of the broken rib. It does vaguely mention a cursing of two men, but the narration explicitly says later on that they are Abu Jahl and Waleed, the two greatest enemies of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). If the Shias insinuate that the two men are supposed to refer to Abu Bakr and Omar, then they would need clear proof of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirty-second narration by Ibn Tawus in Iqbal Al-A’amal: There is no chain included from Sa’ad bin Abdullah to Ja’afar Al-Sadiq.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, we have found that RTS has failed in providing evidence of the burning of the house/breaking of the rib of Fatima in both Sunni and Shia sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And all praise be to Allah the Merciful.</p>
