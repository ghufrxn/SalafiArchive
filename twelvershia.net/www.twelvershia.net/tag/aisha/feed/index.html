<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common questions that Sunnis are faced with by Twelver Shias is the question of the <em>tawba</em> (repentance) of the Companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . Since Sunnis accept that the Companions were not infallible and committed sins, Shias would ask specific questions like, “Where is the evidence that A’isha repented for leaving her home?” or “Where is the evidence that she repented for the battle of Jamal?” They would conclude that if there was no evidence for repentance, that the logical conclusion is that she is in hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This position Twelvers hold is an extreme position. Below, we shall share a statement by Al-Mufeed which refutes their line of thought, in which he excuses people who committed a much greater sin than the sins that A’isha committed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed, the most significant Shia theologian of all time, said in Al-Masa’il Al-Jaroodiyyah p. 36:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We do no affirm that those that claimed Imamah from the progeny of Al-Hasan (<em>alaihi al-salam) </em>knew of the appointments of the other Imams and that they went against them due to stubbornness. We do not judge that they were upon misguidance that requires to be interpreted away with a narration of them being pardoned, and we hope that they will be forgiven. It is possible that due to what they were upon from fighting for the religion and what they faced from killing and pain shall clear away their lapses in their claim of Imamate, and will cultivate for them much reward. Some of our companions affirm that heaven is for all the sons of Fatima (<em>alaiha al-salam)</em> <strong>and holds that they have repented, which is between them and Allah, before they departed from this world, <u>even if this did not become apparent to other slaves (of Allah).</u></strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a nutshell, the children of Al-Hasan, who falsely claimed Imamate, are excused according to Twelver Shias, even if nobody knew of their repentance. This is assumed due to them being the children of Fatima.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, Sunnis can say, we also hold the view that A’isha is to be accepted as someone that is in heaven, due to her decades of efforts in spreading Islamic knowledge, to the extent that she is the most influential female jurist and hadith narrator of all time, even if we did not find explicit evidence of her repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, we also have very explicit evidence that A’isha is in heaven, as per the hadith of Ammar bin Yassir in Saheeh Al-Bukhari (7101), where he said, “She is the wife of your prophet – peace be upon him – in this life and the afterlife.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s “Holy prophet asws desire to bury ayesha (authentic narration)”. The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/holy-prophet-asws-desire-to-bury-ayesha-authentic-narration/" rel="external nofollow">his blog</a> and on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2278:holy-prophet-asws-desire-to-bury-ayesha-authentic-narration&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website. </a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The article contains a narration that SlaveOfAhlubait implies is evidence that the Prophet – peace be upon him – hated A’isha. The narration goes as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>“ayesha says that the day the disease which caused death of holy prophet started, he came to my house and said: oh my headache, i also said oh my head; upon this holy prophet asws said: i wish what has to happen should happen in my life, and i prepare you well and bury you; i said: your intentions are something else, you will marry the same day and and spend night with lady; holy prophet asws said: oh my head! call your father and your brother so that i write letter for abu bakar because i fear that the one who would say will say, and the one who would desire would desire that i am more rightful to caliphate; and allah and all muslim will not accept anyone other than abu bakar</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">[musnad ahmad, urdu, vol 11, page 306]”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration is an obvious explicit merit for A’isha, because the Prophet – peace be upon him – is clearly stating that he would want to personally wash his dead wife, prepare her, and bury her. Is there are greater merit than this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait is aware of this understanding since he has seen the narrations that are clearer about this. He says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“We also find similar narration in urdu version, 11/518;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon returning to that page, we find the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>قَالَ مَا ضَرَّكِ لَوْ مِتِّ قَبْلِي فَغَسَّلْتُكِ وَكَفَّنْتُكِ ثُمَّ صَلَّيْتُ عَلَيْكِ وَدَفَنْتُكِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: “How would dying before me harm you? I would wash you, prepare you, pray upon you, and bury you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately for those that have had their hearts darkened by hating the wives of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , every narration that mentions A’isha is to be understood negatively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s “ayesha and her narrations: an analysis”. The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/ayesha-and-her-narrations-an-analysis/" rel="external nofollow">his blog</a> and on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2277:ayesha-and-her-narrations-an-analysis&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article, by SlaveOfAhlubait, collects “contradictions” in the narrations of A’isha, in order to suggest that she was a lousy hadith narrator, and thus, we should reject her hadiths altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait provides three examples of these so-called “contradictions”:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-INCIDENT OF JEW LADY AND PUNISHMENT IN GRAVE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-PRAYER OF CHASHT (dhuhaa)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; SHOULD LIZARDS BE KILLED OR NOT?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We shall respond to each of these allegations with the necessary evidences.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1- INCIDENT OF JEW LADY AND PUNISHMENT IN GRAVE</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait spends a good deal of time providing narrations in which the Prophet – peace be upon him – is asked about the punishment of the grave. His answer differs in the hadiths, even though the primary narrator of the hadith is A’isha, who has narrated the hadith to several student: Jasra, Sa’eed, Urwa, Thakwan, and Masrooq. We would like to add that Amra is also one of the narrators of this hadith, but SlaveOfAhlubait forgot to include her narration. Some of the narrations suggest that the Prophet – peace be upon him – was not aware of the punishment of the grave when he was first asked about it, while other narrations suggest that he was aware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait argues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“As per the narrations of jasra (narration 1) and masrooq (narration 7 &amp; 8), he was aware of it at that time. Rather if we see the narration of zakwan (narration 6), we find that holy prophet asws gave even further details for that. But on the other hand, when we see narrations of saeed (narration 2) and arwa (narration 3,4,5) he was not aware of it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no reason to suggest that these are contradictions by A’isha when all of these narrations can be reconciled. Ibn Hajar explains in Fath Al-Bari: “What the Prophet – peace be upon him – rejected was that the punishment of the grave would occur to those upon monotheism, then, the Prophet – peace be upon him – was made aware that it could occur to whomever Allah wills, and thus, he affirmed it and warned of it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, when the Prophet – peace be upon him – affirms the existence of the punishment of the grave, he was merely affirming it for non-Muslims. As for the negation, then it is in regards to Muslims, and in the same hadith he comes to learn through revelation that it occurs upon Muslims as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any case, A’isha could have been expressing the story in more than one manner, though, as we can see, this can be reconciled, and does not lead to a contradiction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, we find verses in the Qur’an that seem to contradict one another, like the duration of the creation of the earth, or the question of what is man created from: water, dust, clay, nothing, a blood clot, etc. Of course, this is not the time or place to reconcile these verses, and these allegations so-called &#8220;contradictions&#8221; in the Qur’an have been answered on various Islamic websites online. Though, we bring this to the attention to readers to become aware that the lack of reflection upon verses and hadiths can lead to one assuming the existence of contradictions when there aren’t any.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2- PRAYER OF CHASHT (dhuhaa)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait provides narrations from the students of A’isha. He argues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“If we actually see narrations of Ayesha in this regard, we see that there is not just confusion, rather contradictions in regards to whether holy prophet asws offered them or not, whether he offered it 2 rakat or he offered 4 or he offered 4 &amp; increased it. Different narrations are telling us different facts.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This issue is easily reconcilable. The biggest contradiction in these narrations is that Urwa goes against all the other students of A’isha (Abdullah bin Shaqeeq, Mua’atha, Um Tharra) by saying that the Prophet – peace be upon him – never prayed the Dhuha prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a number of ways to reconcile this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- To reject the narration of Urwa, since he is in the minority. Therefore, he would be accused of being the mistaken one in the narration and not A’isha.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- The likelier possibility is explained by returning to the narration of Urwa in other books. We find that in Muwatta Malik #324, Saheeh Al-Bukhari #1106, and Saheeh Muslim #1174, that Urwa narrates from A’isha, “I never <strong><u>saw</u> </strong>the Prophet – peace be upon him – pray the Dhuha prayers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Another interpretation is that A’isha rejected that the Prophet – peace be upon him – prayed them regularly, and this is supported by the narration of Abdullah bin Shaqeeq when she says, “No (he doesn’t pray it), unless he comes back from travels.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We prefer the second interpretation. If Shias argue that the narration of Um Tharra states that the Prophet – peace be upon him – prayed Dhuha in the house of A’isha then we say that the narration is much weaker than the narration of Urwa, and that it cannot be the preferred narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3- SHOULD LIZARDS BE KILLED OR NOT?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait argues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“So we see 3 narrations, authenticity is proven, in which Ayesha told us that there was no such order from holy prophet asws for killing lizards</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">And</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">On the other hand, we see her own action contradicted that, rather she killed them since she heard hadeeth of prophet asws</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Again we see the same issue and this means that either it was Ayesha who was forgetting and narrating in different forms or that it was narrators who were even changing the meanings, rather making them contradictory</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration that states that A’isha was ordered to kill lizards by the Prophet – peace be upon him – is weak. This is because it comes through the path of Sa’iba the Mawlat of Al-Fakih bin Al-Mugheera, and there is no evidence of her reliability. This is supported by the narration provided by SlaveOfAhlubait himself in Musnad Ahmad 11/149. The only narration that states that Nafi’ heard this narration from A’isha is on 11/447, but it contains an anonymous narrator by the name of Abdullah bin Abdulrahman bin Abi Umayyah.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, the author of the article could not provide binding proof that A’isha was unreliable in hadith. We find the author clutching at straws by arguing that A’isha contradicted herself in the amount of prostrations that the Prophet – peace be upon him – performed in a non-obligatory prayer. Even if we held the opinion that she contradicted herself here, is that sufficient evidence to reject her narrations? The view of Ahl Al-Sunnah is that the companions were fallible in actions and their memory. However, there is no proof that any companions accused A’isha of being unreliable in teaching the <em>sunnah</em> of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . Even <strong>if</strong> one held the view that she made a few mistakes, as the author of the article argues, that does not even amount to a single percent of the amount of narrations that she narrated. It is with this in mind that we conclude that the very intention of weakening A’isha through providing a few so-called “contradictions” is ludicrous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;and praise be to Allah the Most Gracious and Most Merciful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s “Ayesha and her ability to understand quran”. The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/ayesha-and-her-ability-to-understand-quran/" rel="external nofollow">his blog</a> and on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2275:ayesha-and-her-ability-to-understand-quran&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>“ayesha says that once she asked holy prophet asws about the verse {[Shakir] </strong><em><strong>And those who give what they give (in alms) while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return</strong></em><strong> (mominoon/60),} ; she said o prophet asws! does this verse speak of one who steals, does zina and drinks wine? upon this holy prophet said: no, it speaks of one who offers prayers, fasts, and gives charity and he is having fear of allah”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">{molvi zafar iqbal says narration is sahih as per Albany}</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> [musnad ahmad, urdu, vol 11, page 345]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait uses this narration to suggest that A’isha is ignorant when it comes to understanding the meanings of the Qur’an. This is a silly accusation since the Arabic text of the Qur’an is vague regarding the meaning of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah the Almighty states:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَا آتَوْا وَقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The terms “Yu’toon ma Aatoo” can hold various meanings. It can mean “those that commit what they have committed” or “those that give what they give” or “those that enter forth where they have entered”. Due to this, the understanding of the words can suggest a positive or a negative connotation, and in this case, A’isha assumed that it was a negative connotation, since the verse continues that those that do this have fear within their hearts. In other words, a mistake in understanding this narration is only human, which is why A’isha was keen to ask the Prophet – peace be upon him – about the meaning, since she had doubts about her own understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, we find that SlaveOfAhlubait is filled with so much hatred for Abu Bakr that he could not translate the narration correctly. The narration includes the Prophet – peace be upon him – saying to A’isha, “No, O’ daughter of Al-Sideeq.” However, SlaveOfAhlubait’s fingers would not move upon the keyboard to include this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article contains the following narration:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>“ayesha says that once i started mockery of a man or a woman in the presence of holy propet asws, so he said that if i get something even more in return, i will not mock anyone nor i like mockery; i said that safia is this much, and then i pointed of her being dwarf/short heighted; upon this prophet asws said that you have said something which if mixed with water of sea, it will change colour of that”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">{molvi zafar iqbal mentions there that narration is sahih as per Albany and hasan sahih as per timidhi}</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">[musnad ahmad, urdu, vol 11, page 419-420]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is little doubt of the authenticity of this report, though we find it to be an indication of the honesty of A’isha. It is not a common act for one to speak of their own faults, and in this narration, A’isha confesses that the Prophet – peace be upon him – reprimanded her for backbiting.</p>
<p>We do not find any other narrations in which A’isha backbites others, so one cannot say that this was her nature. We also do not find others narrating similar events, which leads us to the conclusion that if A’isha never admitting that she sinned, then it would not have been known.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that narration illustrates an A’isha that is in her later years, perhaps in her fifties or sixties, who is looking back at her actions as a teenager, and sharing the words of the Prophet – peace be upon him – as a lesson to all, while using herself as an example of the culprit.</p>
<p>For more on the merits of A’isha, refer to our article: The Praise of pro-Ali Companions for A’isha.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Karbalai Hussainiyya’s (translated by SlaveOfAhlubait) “Ayesha doubting the Intellect of Bibi Fatima (a.s)?” The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/ayesha-doubting-the-intellect-of-bibi-fatima-a-s/#more-4352" rel="external nofollow">SoA’s blog</a> and the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3567:ayesha-doubting-the-intellect-of-bibi-fatima-a-s&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait quotes the following narration, then provides a short commentary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #800000;"> “Ayesha says that I never saw anyone in habits and ways more similar to Holy Prophet (asws) than Bibi Fatima (asws) in standing and sitting. When she would meet Holy Prophet (asws), He would stand up, kiss her, and make her sit at his place. And When Holy Prophet (asws) would meet her, She would stand up, kiss him and make him sit at her place. When Prophet (asws) got ill, She met him, and fell on him, and then raised her head and cried, then fell on him, raised her head again, and laughed. I used to think she is the most intelligent in women, but she was a women. When HE died, I asked her that I had seen you laying on him, raising head and crying; and then laying on him, raising head and laughing; what made You do this? She replied that Holy Prophet (asws) had told her that He would die in this illness, so She cried; and then He told her that She would be the first of AhluBait to meet Him, so She laughed”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA comments:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> “So, We see that there was a particular reason for the way Bibi Fatima (asws) behaved, but Ayesha doubted her intellect without asking her the reason at that time.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I respond:<br />
“Doubted her intellect?” What does that even mean? Is that a suggestion that A’isha believed that Fatima was mentally deficient? The correct criticism towards A’isha is that she referred to Fatima as “a woman”, since she believed that Fatima’s emotions were getting the best of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This is a desperate attempt by the Shias to defame A’isha and her position towards Fatima. Is it not enough for the Shias to find A’isha claiming that there is nothing who is similar in her habits to the Prophet – peace be upon him – than Fatima? Is it not enough for the Shias to find A’isha narrating that Fatima is the mistress of the believers of paradise as per Saheeh Muslim #4488?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article entitled: “O Ayesha! Be Watchful that You are Not in Uprising Wives”. The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/o-ayesha-be-watchful-that-you-are-not-in-uprising-wives/" rel="external nofollow">his blog</a> and on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3712:o-ayesha-be-watchful-that-you-are-not-in-uprising-wives&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait quotes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>And with the Chain to Umm Salma:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>She said that Holy Prophet (asws) talked of Uprising/Khurooj of some Umhaat-ul-Momineen, and Ayesha laughed. So He said: Be watchful o Humaira that it is not You. Then He turned to Imam Ali. And said: O Ali! If you are the Wali of Her Amr, be gentle………..</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: The hadith is weak due to the disconnection between Salim bin Abi Al-Ja’d from Um Salama. The authors of Jami’ of Tahseel and Tuhfat Al-Tahseel have provided quotes from earlier scholars that Salim&#8217;s narrations from A’isha and Abu Huraira are disconnected, suggesting that he was not in Madinah while they were alive. They also said that “others” have said that he didn’t meet Um Salama, which is logical since Um Salama died around the same time as A’isha.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hakim authenticated the narration and said that it is upon the conditions of the Saheehain. However, this is a mistake on his behalf since Al-Bukhari didn’t include Ammar Al-Duhani nor Abd Al-Jabbar bin Al-Ward in his book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SlaveOfAhlubait, in response to our brother from YouPuncturedTheArk (another Sunni website), said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Keep in mind Dhabi did not weaken anyone including Abdul Jabbar, who is Ibn al-Ward&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">As regards to Narrator Ammar ibn Muawia al-Duhani, He was Trustworthy in view of Abu Hatim al-Razi, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Nisai, Yahya ibn Maeen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: This response of SlaveOfAhlubait is irrelevant. The purpose of stating that these two narrators are not “upon the conditions of the Shaikhain”, is not to suggest that they are weak, but rather to show that Al-Hakim was erroneous in his examination of the narration. Since that is the case, he should not be trusted in his grading of the narration. In this case, the issue with the narration is the disconnection, not the reliability of Abd Al-Jabbar or Ammar Al-Duhani.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the wording of the narration, we have no issue with it, for the Prophet – peace be upon him – warned his wives by suggesting that the dogs of Al-Haw’ab will bark at one of them. In other words, we are aware, and authenticate the narration that includes a vague warning towards the wives (in which A’isha is intended), while we have our doubts about the Prophet – peace be upon him – being specific about the warning, since it has not arrived us through an authentic and connected chain.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following are a few authentic narrations of merits that have been narrated by those that were considered to be pro-Ali companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him – towards A’isha – may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Ammar bin Yasser</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Bukhari in his Saheeh (#6572):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ammar climbed onto the pulpit in Al-Kufa and mentioned A’isha and her expedition and said, “She is the wife of your prophet – peace be upon him – in this life and the hereafter, but this (her expedition) is a trial for you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Ibn Abbas</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Ahmad in Fadha’il Al-Sahaba 2/1104:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Abbas entered upon A’isha when she was dying, while she was with Abdullah bin Abdulrahman. He (Abdullah) said, “Ibn Abbas asks your permission to enter, and he is one of your best sons.” She said, “Let me be away from Ibn Abbas and his praise.” Abdullah bin Abdulrahman said, “He is a recitor of the Book of Allah, a scholar of the religion, so allow him to enter to greet you and to see you away.” She said, “Allow him in if you like.” He was allowed in, and Ibn Abbas greeted her and sat down. He said, “Be pleased O’ Mother of Believers, for by Allah, there is nothing left between you and your freedom from the pain and fatigue and meeting the beloved, the Prophet and his party, other than your soul’s deportation.” She said, “What else?” He said, “You were the most loved of the Messenger of Allah’s wives to him, and he wouldn’t have loved anyone that was not good, and Allah – the Almighty – revealed your innocence from above the heavens, and there is no mosque on this earth that does not recite this night and day, and your necklace fell during the night of Al-Abwa’a, which caused the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him – to stay in with the people who searched for it until the morning came and the people had no water, where in which Allah revealed: ‘Betake yourselves to pure earth, then wipe your faces,’ (Al-Nisa: 43) and this verse was a permission that was given to all the people which you were a cause of, for by Allah, you are blessed.” She said, “Let me be O’ Ibn Abbas from all this, by Allah, I wish I was forgotten.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Bukhari in his Saheeh (#3159):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him – said: There are many men that are complete, but the only women that were complete were Asiya the wife of the Pharaoh, and Maryam bint Imran, and A’isha is to women as Thareed is to other dishes.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Abu Musa is a companion that is differed upon by Shias. Some have condemned him, while other scholars have praised him, like Ibn Dawud in his Rijal in the first section of his book, which includes the praised narrators and companions. In the eyes of Sunnis, we believe that Abu Musa was pro-Ali, for if he wasn’t then he wouldn’t have been sent as a representative of Ali after his war with Mu’awiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5565, Jabir narrated that a group of Jews pass by the Prophet – peace be upon him – and say, “Al-Saam (death) be upon you” A’isha cursed them intensely by saying, “Al-Saam and curses be upon you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration demonstrates A’isha’s love for the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; .

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to ShiaSunni.info’s article “Aisha prayed in the way that is against the Sharia Law.” The article was published on the 26th of March, 2013, and can be found <a href="http://www.shiasunni.info/shocking-facts-about-sahih-bukhari/aisha-bint-e-abu-bakr-wife-of-the-prophet-in-bukhari/243-aisha-prayed-against-the-sharia-law" rel="external nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ShiaSunni.info explain:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);">We know that if someone is in journey, he must pray QASAR (half prayers, 2 raka,at for Dhuar, Asar and Isha) but we can see how sharia law was changed by these high level figures for our Sunni fellows. We are going to mention narration about Uthman that he did the same thing…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There is no difference of opinion that A’isha and Uthman prayed in two prostrations, however, it is incorrect to suggest that Sharia Law was changed. As we can see from the narration quoted by ShiaSunni.info, A’isha said, “Prayer, when it first was obligatory, was two prostrations. That’s how it remained for travels and it was completed in civilized areas.” Al-Zuhri asking Urwa, the nephew of A’isha, “Why did A’isha complete it (instead of shortening it)?” He (Urwa) said, “She interpreted it the same was Uthman did.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The narration is clear that A’isha saw that two prostrations were still applicable for prayers during travel, so how can anyone suggest that she changed Shariah Law?! A more rational suggestion would be that she did not following one of the teachings of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), though even this would be incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To understand the opinion of A’isha one must first be aware of the ruling of praying two raka’at (prostrations). One of the most used narrations that describes the ruling is the hadith of Ya’ala bin Umayyah, which is narrated by Imam Muslim #1108. The narration is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I (Ya’ala) told Omar: And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you. [Surat Al-Nisa’a: 101] Yet now, the people are safe. He replied: I was curious by what caused you to be curious, so I asked the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) about that and he said: It is a charity from Allah upon you, so accept His charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Al-Khattabi in Ma’alim Al-Sunan 1/226 explains: There is within this evidence that the completion (of prayer) is the asl (basis). Don’t you see that they were curious about the shortening of the prayer due to fear?! If the basis of prayer during travel were two prostrations, then they would not be surprised. This is evidence that shortening is a part of the complete basis; some was remove and some remained. The words: It is a charity from Allah upon you &#8211; is evidence that it is a rukhsa (permission) that they were permitted, and permissions are for matters that are to be made permissible, and not for matters that are decided upon, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In other words, Al-Khattabi is saying that it is permissible to shorten the prayer during travels, not that it is obligatory to do so.<br />
This is supported by A’isha’s testimony in the authentic hadith in Sunan Al-Bayhaqi 3/143 when Urwa asked her: Shouldn’t you pray two prostrations? She replied: O’ nephew, it is not a tiring for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The narration implies that she understood that the shortening of prayer is permissible, not that it is obligatory. This position is held by Imam Malik, Al-Shafi’ee, and Imam Ahmad. See Hukm Al-Ihtijaaj bi Khabr Al-Wahid itha Amala Al-Rawi bi Khilafih p. 255 by Abdullah Al-Matrifi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the light of the above, it makes perfect sense why A’isha would teach the sunnah and go against it. Once again, it is because she believed that the sunnah was only a rukhsa (a matter that was made permissible), not that it was obligatory, and that it was optional whether one wants to complete the prayer or not.</p>
