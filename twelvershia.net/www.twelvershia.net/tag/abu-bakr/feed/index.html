<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">The following article will provide conclusive proof that Jafar Al-Sadiq is a descendant of Abu Bakr, from Sunni and Shia sources. The article will also include a refutation to a desperate Shia attempt to weaken one of these narrations in which Jafar speaks highly of his great-grandfather.</span></p>

<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">In an authentic narration in Musnad Musadad, Jafar praises Abu Bakr then states: “He gave birth to me twice.” (See ItHaaf Al-Maharah #8852)</span></p>

<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> As we can see, the refutation includes a statement from Imam Ahmad in which he strongly denounces Mu’ath bin Al-Muthanna, a narrator of the hadith. However, upon returning to the original source that is quoted, we found a completely different statement. </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="tm6">“He (Mu’ath) said: It was said to Ahmad: What of a man that purposefully does not pray the </span><em><span class="tm7">witr</span></em><span class="tm6"> prayer? He (Ahmad) said: Who does that is a bad man, he left the </span><em><span class="tm7">sunnah</span></em><span class="tm6"> of the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; . He then said: He is a person whose </span><em><span class="tm7">adala</span></em><span class="tm6"> has been dropped if he purposefully did not pray the </span><em><span class="tm7">witr</span></em><span class="tm6">. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">As we can see, the statement from Imam Ahmad has nothing to do with Mu’ath. Rather, Mu’ath is simply quoting from Imam Ahmad.</span></p>

<h2 class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, it is clear to the objective observer that Jafar Al-Sadiq has twice as much of Abu Bakr’s blood running through his veins than the blood of Ali bin Abi Talib.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">Now, we are fully aware that being a descendant of someone does not mean that one is upon his views, however, we simply wanted to bring this information to the attention of our Shia readers, since most of them have been oblivious of this fact that was hidden away by their scholars. This reality is especially embarrassing for those that claim that Abu Bakr is from a impure lineage that actively and openly participated in lewd acts.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm6" style="color: #000000;">In one of our future projects &#8211; Allah willing &#8211; , we will be compiling authentic narrations from Jafar Al-Sadiq in which he praises Abu Bakr, so stay tuned. </span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>The Hajj led by Abu Bakr (ra) in 9 AH</u></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the arguments scholars of Sunnah give to show the high status of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq is that he was appointed as the chief of pilgrims or Ameer-ul-Hajj, and since Hajj is the type of worship which includes all other types of `Ibadah hence it indicates that Abu Bakr was the most knowledgeable of them regarding the issues of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However Shiites have a different approach while dealing with this incident. They do not have any details regarding the leadership of Hajj. All they have is an incident related to the delivery of the Bara’ah to the inhabitants of Makkah and based on that they assumed that Abu Bakr was removed from the leadership when `Ali was ordered to deliver Bara&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Famous Shi`i scholar Ibn Mutahhar al-Hilli said while speaking about Abu Bakr:<br />
[The Prophet (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) did not appoint him as a leader in any matter during his lifetime… And when he sent him with Bara’ah he took him back after three days. So how could any sane person accept the leadership of someone who is not liked by the Prophet, through the revelation from Allah, for the conveying of even ten verses of Bara’ah.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia al-Sharif al-Murtada says in Al-Shafi:<br />
[As for his saying (i.e. of Qadi Abdul Jabbar the Mu’atazalite) that Abu Bakr was the Ameer appointed by the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) during the season of Hajj and during the conquest of Makkah, then it is not accepted. Our companions [Shi’ites] say that when Abu Bakr was removed from the responsibility to deliver Bara&#8217;ah simultaneously he was also removed from the leadership of the Hajj&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is utter falsehood to claim that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq was not appointed as an Ameer in any matter, as Al-Hilli claimed, or he was removed from the leadership of the Hajj expedition, as Sharif Murtada assumed. One thing to consider here is that there is contradiction between the views of Murtada and al-Hilli. According to Murtada, Abu Bakr was removed from the leadership while as per Al-Hilli he was never given the leadership in the first place, but rather he was only told to deliver the verses of Bara’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First to counter the claim of Al-Hilli that Abu Bakr was never given the leading role in any expedition, let me point out the fact that he was at least appointed as an Ameer or Imam during the following occasions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Hajj expedition in 9 AH.<br />
2. Imam of Prayer during the final days of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam).<br />
3. Military expedition towards Banu Fizarah in Najd in 7 AH.<br />
4. Military expedition at Khaybar before `Ali was given the flag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no dispute regarding his leadership in the Hajj expedition during that year and even Al-Murtada accepted it but he claimed that he Abu Bakr (ra) was replaced by `Ali (ra) after three days</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, Ja`far Murtada al-`Amili also claimed in his encyclopedic “As-Sahih min Seerah al-Imam al-`Ali” that Abu Bakr was simultaneously removed from the leadership when the responsibility of delivering Bara&#8217;ah was taken away from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Ali was sent to deliver Bara’ah only while Abu Bakr was leading the pilgrims:</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah are in agreement that `Ali was sent to announce Bara&#8217;ah to the people of Makkah not to lead people in their pilgrimage. Imam Abu Ja`far al-Tahawi says in his famous book Sharh Ma`ani al-Aathar (9/225) while answering the objections of those who thought there is a contradiction in these narrations:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أَنَّهُ مَا فِي ذَلِكَ اضْطِرَابٌ كَمَا ذَكَرَ؛ لِأَنَّ الْإِمْرَةَ فِي تِلْكَ الْحِجَّةِ , إِنَّمَا كَانَتْ لِأَبِي [ص:226] بَكْرٍ خَاصَّةً , لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ فِيهَا , وَكَانَتِ الطَّاعَةُ فِي الْأَمْرِ وَالنَّهْيِ الَّذِي يَكُونُ فِيهَا إِلَى أَبِي بَكْرٍ لَا إِلَى سِوَاهُ , فَمِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ بَعَثَ أَبَا هُرَيْرَةَ فِي الْمُؤَذِّنِينَ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا مَعَهُ لِيَمْتَثِلُوا مَا يَأْمُرُهُمْ بِهِ عَلِيٌّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ فِيمَا بَعَثَهُ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَهُ , وَقَدْ دَلَّ عَلَى ذَلِكَ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There is no contradiction in them as they say. That is because the leadership during that Hajj was for Abu Bakr specifically; nobody was his associate in leadership. And obedience in command and forbiddance was for Abu Bakr and not for anyone else. And for that reason he (i.e Abu Bakr) sent Abu Hurayrah among the callers so that they could follow `Ali in what he tells them to announce as per the instruction of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam).”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then Imam Tahawi mentions some narrations which I am also going to quote among other narrations to make this historic event clear. Among those hadith is the hadith Imam Nasai included in his Sunan (2958) through Shu`ba from Mughirah from `Aamir Ash-Sha`bi from Muharrar b. Abi Hurayrah from his father Abu Hurayrah (ra) who said, “I was with `Ali when the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) sent him with (the verses of) Bara’ah…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Hurayrah came with `Ali (ra) to join Abu Bakr (ra). And later on Abu Bakr (ra) sent him with `Ali (ra) to aid him in announcing Bara’ah in front of each and every group of people living in Makkah. Hence, Imam Bukhari records in his Sahih [369, 1622, 3177, 4656], Muslim in his Sahih [1347], Nasai in Sunan [2957] and many others through Ibn Shihab from Humaid b. Abdur-Rahman from Abu Huraira, “Abu Bakr sent him, during the pilgrimage he was leading, with the group of people who were announcing that no polytheist would perform Hajj after that year and no one would circumambulate without clothes…” – This has also been narrated through Ibn Shihab from Ibn Musayyib from Abu Hurayrah as in Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim [6/1745]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A more detailed description is narrated by Nasai in his Sunan [2993] and “Khasais `Ali” [78], Ad-Darimi in Sunan [1956], Ibn Khuzaima in Sahih [2974], Ibn Hibban in Sahih [6645] through Ibn Juraij from Abdullah b. Uthman b. Khuthaim from Abu Zubair from Jabir [ra]:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“When the Messenger of Allah [sallallahu alaihi wa sallam] returned from the `Umrah of Ji`iranah he sent Abu Bakr to lead people in Hajj. We went with him until when he was was at al-`Urj the Iqamah of prayer was said and he stood up to say Takbeer. He stopped when he heard the grunting of the camel of the Messenger of Allah. He said, “This is the grunting of the camel of the Messenger of Allah [sallallahu alaihi wa sallam]. Something has been disclosed to the Messenger of Allah, and perhaps he is here and we will pray with him.” But it was `Ali on the camel. Abu Bakr asked him, “Are you here as a leader or as a messenger?” He answered, “Rather as a messenger. The Messenger of Allah sent me with Bara’ah so that I may recite it to the people at Hajj.” So we came to Makkah and one day before Tarwiyah Abu Bakr stood up and addressed the people, telling them about the rituals. When he finished his speech, `Ali stood up and recited the Bara’ah to the people until he finished it…. On the first day of Nafr, Abu Bakr stood up and addressed the people, telling them how to offer their sacrifice and how to stone the Jamarat, and teaching them their rituals. When he finished `Ali stood up and recited the Bara’ah…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of its narrators are reliable except Ibn Khuthaim who was a disputed narrator. Nasai said, “He was not strong.” But at another place he declared him Thiqah. Ibn Ma’een declared him Thiqah in one of the reports. Al-‘Ijli, Ibn Sa’d and Ibn Hibban also declared him Thiqah. [Tahdhib al-Kamal]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One may object to this report by saying that the `Umrah of Ji`iranah happened in the year 8 after Hijrah while Abu Bakr led the Hajj in the year 9 after Hijrah. So how it can be reconciled?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to it is that the narrator here is giving approximate dating and the narration only states that Abu Bakr led people after the `Umrah of Ji`iranah not that they both happened in the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This narration also emphasizes that it was Abu Bakr who taught people the Islamic rituals of Hajj and `Ali only announced the Bara’ah after him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar description is also mentioned in a narration reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari in his Tafseer (14/113) through Abu Zur’ah al-Misri from Haiwah b. Shuraih from Abu Humaid b. Ziyad from Abu Mu’awaiyah al-Bajali from Abu Sahba’ al-Bakri that `Ali bin Abi Talib said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) sent Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafah to observe people in their Hajj and sent me with him to proclaim forty verses of Bara’ah. When he reached `Arafah he delivered his speech in front of people. When he completed the sermon he looked at me and said, “Stand O `Ali and deliver the message of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam).” So I stood and recited to them forty verses of Bara’ah…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not all as Tirmidhi narrates in Sunan [3091], Tabrani in “Al-Awsat” [928], Al-Haakim in “Al-Mustadrak” [4375] through Sufyan b. Husain from Hakam b. `Utaibah from Miqsam from Ibn `Abbas that when Abu Bakr heard the foot-steps of the she-camel of the Messenger of Allah [sallallahu alaihi wa sallam] he went back looking for it in fear, thinking of the Messenger of Allah [sallallahu alaihi wa sallam]. He found `Ali and submitted the order of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) to him. He told `Ali to announce those orders. So they both went and performed Hajj rituals. `Ali stood up in the days of Tashriq and announced… When he became tired Abu Bakr stood up and announced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This hadith was also reported by Al-Khawarazmi in “Manaqib `Ali” [pg.164, no. 195] and he adds, “This narration shows that the leader over the pilgrims was Abu Bakr and `Ali was given the task of delivering the verses of Bara’ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We see that all these narrations indicate that Abu Bakr was leading the people in Hajj and `Ali was there to deliver Bara’ah to the people of Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Why was Abu Bakr stopped from delivering Bara’ah?</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason given for deposing of Abu Bakr from this responsibility of delivering the Bara&#8217;ah, as per the wording of some reports, is that no one should deliver it except the Prophet himself or someone else from his household.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, the explanation given by scholars based on the apparent wording of the narration is that the Arabs would not accept the declaration of nullification of a pact or treaty except from the person who made the treaty or someone who is from his household.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This explanation has been given by many scholars including Fakhruddin Ar-Razi in his Tafsir (15/524), Muhibb at-Tabari in “Dhakhair al-‘Uqbah” (1/70), Ibn Taiymiyya in Minhaj (8/296), Ibn Hajar in Sharh al-Bukhari (8/321) and Az-Zurqani in Sharh Mawahib al-Ladunniyah (4/119).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Islam does not support such trends but since declaration was for the disbelievers of Makkah and they had to face the consequence of it if they did not follow it therefore to establish the Hujjah on them their norm was followed. This is mentioned by ‘Allamah Muhibb at-Tabari in Dhakhair al ‘Uqbah (1/70).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Islam does not teach any such idea that `Ali (ra) was the only competent person to deliver the message of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). In fact, Islam teaches:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنْ جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَنْ تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O  you  who  have  believed,  if  there  comes  to  you  a  disobedient  one  with  information, investigate,  lest  you  harm  a  people  out  of  ignorance  and  become,  over  what  you  have done,  regretful.} [49:6]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This indicates that if a truthful and reliable person conveys something to you then trust him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said, as reported in Sahih Bukhari (7078), during his sermon at Mina:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">اللهم اشهد، فليبلغ الشاهد الغائب، فإنه رب مبلغ يبلغه لمن هو أوعى له</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“O Allah be witness! So those of you who are present should convey it (i.e my message) to those who are absent for it is possible that the conveyor might convey it to someone who comprehends it better than him.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very popularly known that the Prophet (saw) would send many of his students and Companions to teach people religion, at all times. It is unheard of that only one man can deliver his message except in a very special situation like this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Narrations being used to show that Abu Bakr was removed from leadership:</u></strong></p>
<p>A- Tirmidhi (3090) narrates through Hammad b. Salamah from Simak b. Harb from Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaiahi wa sallam) sent Abu Bakr with (the verses of) of Bara&#8217;ah. When he reached Dhul Hulaifah he said “No one will convey from me except myself or someone from my household”. Then he called `Ali and gave it to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tirmidhi said: This is Hasan Gharib. Albani also declared it Hasan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simak b. Harb in this chain is a well-known disputed narrator. Besides this there is no evidence in this that Abu Bakr was replaced by `Ali as a leader. This only speaks of the message of Bara’ah and how `Ali was asked to deliver it in place of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A doubt may come to mind that if Abu Bakr returned back to Madinah then how he could have led the pilgrims!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, the chain of this is not comparatively strong because Simak b. Harb is not that strong in hadith. Many scholars have criticized him due to mistakes he committed in hadith. Secondly, Abu Bakr could have returned back to the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) for only a short period of time, and then afterward he would have arrived to lead the pilgrims as the distance between Dhul Hulaifah and Madina is not too much. Thirdly, it could easily be understood that he asked him this AFTER he finished Hajj and returned to Madinah. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p>B- Abdullah b. Ahmad narrates in Musnad (1297) through Muhammad b. Jabir from Simak from Hanash from `Ali that when the initial ten verses of Bara&#8217;ah were revealed Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam sent Abu Bakr to deliver it. Then he called and said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أدرك أبا بكر، فحيثما لحقته فخذ الكتاب منه، فاذهب به إلى أهل مكة، فاقرأه عليهم</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Find Abu Bakr and wherever you find him take the book from him. Then go towards the people of Makkah and recite it to them”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Ali took the book from him. Abu Bakr returned and asked the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) whether anything was revealed regarding him. He replied, “No, but Jibreel came to me and said, ‘No one shall convey it from you except you yourself or someone from your household’.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This chain is weak due to Muhammad b. Jabir al-Hanafi. Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah (7/227): “This chain is weak and there Nakarah in its text.” He also weakened it in Tafsir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With regards to Muhammad b. Jabir al-Hanafi it is mentioned in “Taqreeb at-Tahdheeb” (1/471): He was truthful. His books were lost and so his memory deteriorated. He mixed things too much. He turned blind therefore he was involved in Talqin.</p>
<p>C- Imam Ahmad (4) reports through Israeel who said: Abu Ishaq said from Zaid b. Yasee’ from Abu Bakr as-Siddiq similar to the previous narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shuaib Arnaut weakened this narration and quoted Ibn Hajar from “Atraaf al-Musnad” where he said this is disconnected between Zaid and Abu Bakr. He also quoted Al-Jaurqani who said this narration is Munkar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides there is a mistake in this chain and the actual tradition is through Zaid from Ali (not Abu Bakr). This narration has also been narrated in Mursal form by Abu ‘Ubaid in “Al-Amwal” (457) and At-Tabari in Tafseer (14/106) through Abu Ishaq from Zaid b. Yathee&#8217; in Mursal form. See al-‘Ilal (67) by Ad-Daarqutni.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We see that either the narrations cited to claim that Abu Bakr never led the people in Hajj are weak or they are completely vague and thus cannot as evidence against clear and authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>The description reported in the strong and authentic narrations</u></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu al-Sahba’ said: I asked `Ali ibn abi Talib may Allah be pleased with him about the day of the great Hajj, `Ali said: Rasul-Allah (saw) sent Abu Bakr ibn abi Quhafah may Allah be pleased with him to conduct for the people their Hajj, and he sent me alongside him with forty verses from Bara’ah. Abu Bakr had reached `Arafah and delivered his sermon, then he turned towards me and said: “Stand O `Ali, and deliver the message of Rasul-Allah (saw).” So I did that then we walked until we reached Mina, and I threw the stone and sacrificed then shaved, I realized that the people of al-Jami` never attended Abu Bakr’s sermon at `Arafah, so I moved from tent to tent reading them Abu Bakr’s sermon and telling them of the difference between the day of sacrifice and the day of `Arafah.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunan al-Nasa’i al-Sughra:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أَخْبَرَنَا إِسْحَاق بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، قَالَ: قَرَأْتُ عَلَى أَبِي قُرَّةَ مُوسَى بْنِ طَارِقٍ، عَنْ ابْنِ جُرَيْجٍ، قَالَ: حَدَّثَنِي عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ عُثْمَانَ بْنِ خُثَيْمٍ، عَنْ أَبِي الزُّبَيْرِ، عَنْ جَابِرٍ، &#8221; أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ حِينَ رَجَعَ مِنْ عُمْرَةِ الْجِعِرَّانَةِ بَعَثَ أَبَا بَكْرٍ عَلَى الْحَجِّ، فَأَقْبَلْنَا مَعَهُ، حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَ بِالْعَرْجِ ثَوَّبَ بِالصُّبْحِ، ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى لِيُكَبِّرَ، فَسَمِعَ الرَّغْوَةَ خَلْفَ ظَهْرِهِ، فَوَقَفَ عَلَى التَّكْبِيرِ، فَقَالَ: هَذِهِ رَغْوَةُ نَاقَةِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ الْجَدْعَاءِ، لَقَدْ بَدَا لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ فِي الْحَجِّ فَلَعَلَّهُ أَنْ يَكُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ فَنُصَلِّيَ مَعَهُ، فَإِذَا عَلِيٌّ عَلَيْهَا، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَبُو بَكْرٍ أَمِيرٌ، أَمْ رَسُولٌ؟ قَالَ: لَا، بَلْ رَسُولٌ أَرْسَلَنِي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ بِبَرَاءَةَ أَقْرَؤُهَا عَلَى النَّاسِ فِي مَوَاقِفِ الْحَجِّ، فَقَدِمْنَا مَكَّةَ، فَلَمَّا كَانَ قَبْلَ التَّرْوِيَةِ بِيَوْمٍ قَامَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ، فَخَطَبَ النَّاسَ، فَحَدَّثَهُمْ عَنْ مَنَاسِكِهِمْ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرَغَ قَامَ عَلِيٌّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ، فَقَرَأَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بَرَاءَةٌ حَتَّى خَتَمَهَا، ثُمَّ خَرَجْنَا مَعَهُ، حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ عَرَفَةَ قَامَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ، فَخَطَبَ النَّاسَ، فَحَدَّثَهُمْ عَنْ مَنَاسِكِهِمْ، حَتَّى إِذَا فَرَغَ قَامَ عَلِيٌّ فَقَرَأَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بَرَاءَةٌ حَتَّى خَتَمَهَا، ثُمَّ كَانَ يَوْمُ النَّحْرِ، فَأَفَضْنَا، فَلَمَّا رَجَعَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ خَطَبَ النَّاسَ، فَحَدَّثَهُمْ عَنْ إِفَاضَتِهِمْ، وَعَنْ نَحْرِهِمْ، وَعَنْ مَنَاسِكِهِمْ، فَلَمَّا فَرَغَ قَامَ عَلِيٌّ، فَقَرَأَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بَرَاءَةٌ حَتَّى خَتَمَهَا، فَلَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمُ النَّفْرِ الْأَوَّلُ، قَامَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ فَخَطَبَ النَّاسَ فَحَدَّثَهُمْ كَيْفَ يَنْفِرُونَ؟ وَكَيْفَ يَرْمُونَ؟ فَعَلَّمَهُمْ مَنَاسِكَهُمْ، فَلَمَّا فَرَغَ قَامَ عَلِيٌّ فَقَرَأَ بَرَاءَةٌ عَلَى النَّاسِ حَتَّى خَتَمَهَا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu al-Zubayr from Jabir, that the Prophet (saw) upon his return from the `Umrah of al-Ji`ranah, sent Abu Bakr as the chief of Hajj, so we followed him until we reached al-`Urj when he made the Iqamah of the morning, then he stood up to make Takbir when he (suddenly) heard grunting behind his back which made him stop. Abu Bakr said: “This is the grunting of Rasul-Allah’s (saw) camel, maybe he changed his mind and came so we may pray behind him!” However, it turned out to be `Ali, so Abu Bakr asked: “Are you sent as a leader or a messenger?” `Ali said: “No, I am only a messenger. Rasul-Allah (saw) sent me with the Surah of Bara’ah that I may recite it for the people during Hajj.” When we reached Makkah one day before Tarwiyah, Abu Bakr stood and delivered a sermon for the people, he taught them the rituals of Hajj and when he finished `Ali stood and recited the complete Surah of Bara’ah. On the day of `Arafah, Abu Bakr stood to address the people and teach them their Hajj then `Ali recited Bara’ah. Then came the day of sacrifice and we departed and Abu Bakr taught us about the departure and the sacrifice and after him `Ali stood and recited Bara’ah. Then finally on the day of stoning, Abu Bakr taught us and `Ali recited once again.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some scholars do not accept the narrations of abu al-Zubayr from Jabir (ra) unless he declares hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sirat Ibn Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال ابن اسحاق: وحدثني حكيم بن حكيم بن عباد بن حنيف، عن أبي جعفر محمد بن علي رضوان الله عليه، أنه قال: «لما نزلت براءة على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلّم وقد كان بعث أبا بكر الصديق ليقيم للناس الحج، قيل له: يا رسول الله! لو بعثت بها إلى أبي بكر، فقال: لا يؤدي عني إلا رجل من أهل بيتي، ثم دعا علي بن أبي طالب رضوان الله عليه، فقال له: أخرج بهذه القصّة من صدر براءة، وأذن في الناس يوم النحر إذا اجتمعوا بمنى، أنه لا يدخل الجنّة كافر، ولا يحجّ بعد العام مشرك، ولا يطوف بالبيت عريان، ومن كان له عند رسول الله ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ عهدٌ فهو له إلى مدته، فخرج علي بن أبي طالب رضوان الله عليه، على ناقة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلّم العضباء، حتّى أدرك أبا بكر بالطريق، فلما رآه أبو بكر بالطريق قال: أأمير أم مأمور؟ فقال: بل مأمور، ثم مضيا، فأقام أبو بكر للناس الحج والعرب إذ ذاك في تلك السنة على منازلهم من الحج، التي كانوا عليها في الجاهلية، حتّى إذا كان يوم النحر، قام علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه، فأذن في الناس بالذي أمره به رسول الله’ ـ إلى أن قال: ـ ثم قدما على رسول الله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn Ishaq said: Hakeem b. Hakeem b. `Abbad b. Hunayf narrated to me from Abu Ja`far al-Baqir who said: Bara’ah was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam), while he had already sent Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to establish Hajj for the people, it was said to him, “O Messenger of Allah, It is better that you send this to Abu Bakr.” He answered, “No one shall deliver it except a man from my household.” Then he called `Ali and said, “Go with this section of Bara’ah and announce to the people during the day of sacrifice [i.e. An-Nahr] when they assembled at Mina. Announce that no disbeliever shall enter paradise and no polytheist shall perform Hajj after this year. No one shall circumambulate the Ka`abah without clothes. And whosoever has a pact with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) then it is to remain till its fixed time.” So `Ali went out on al-`Adhba the she-camel of the messenger of Allah until he found Abu Bakr on the way. Abu Bakr asked, “Are you sent as chief or as follower?” He replied, “Rather I am sent as a follower.” Then they went forward and Abu Bakr led people in hajj. Arabs in that year were on their old traditions of pilgrimage until the day of Sacrifice when `Ali stood up and announce among the people that which the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) commanded him…]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seerah Ibn Hisham [2/545-546] Tafseer Tabri (14/107-108)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Hadith by Muhammad al-Baqir is Hasan and Ibn Ishaq has narrated a lot of historical incidents through this chain. Hakeem b. Hakeem has been rated saduq by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani and Hasan al-Hadith by Al-Dhahabi. This narration is the story of the event as narrated by Ahlul-Bayt to their followers and students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ma`alim al-Tanzil lil-Baghawi:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدُ الْوَاحِدِ الْمَلِيحِيُّ، أَخْبَرَنَا أَحْمَدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ النُّعَيْمِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ يُوسُفَ، حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ، حَدَّثَنَا إِسْحَاقُ، حَدَّثَنَا يَعْقُوبُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ أَخِي ابْنِ شِهَابٍ، عَنْ عَمِّهِ، أَخْبَرَنِي حُمَيْدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ أَنَّ أَبَا هُرْيَرَةَ قَالَ: بَعَثَنِي أَبُو بَكْرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ فِي تِلْكَ الْحَجَّةِ فِي مُؤَذِّنِينَ يَوْمَ النَّحْرِ، نُؤَذِّنُ بِمِنًى: أَلا لا يَحُجُّ بَعْدَ الْعَامِ مُشْرِكٌ، وَلا يَطُوفُ بِالْبَيْتِ عُرْيَانُ قَالَ حُمَيْدُ بنُ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ: ثُمَّ أَرْدَفَ رَسُول اللَّهِ عَلِيًّا، فَأَمَرَهُ أَنْ يُؤَذِّنَ بِ بَرَاءَةٌ، قَالَ أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ: فَأَذَّنَ مَعَنَا عَلَى أَهْلِ مِنًى يَوْمَ النَّحْرِ: أَلا لا يَحُجُّ بَعْدَ الْعَامِ مُشْرِكٌ، وَلا يَطُوفُ بِالْبَيْتِ عُرْيَانُ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Humayd bin `Abdul-Rahman that abu Hurayrah said: Abu Bakr sent me during that Hajj in the company of two callers on the day of sacrifice, so that we may call in Mina: That after this year, no polytheist shall attend pilgrimage nor will a naked one circulate around the house. Humayd said: Then Rasul-Allah (saw) sent `Ali and ordered him to recite Bara’ah. Abu Hurayrah said: So `Ali called alongside us in Mina: That after this year, no polytheist shall attend pilgrimage nor will a naked one circulate around the house.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tarikh ibn abi Khaythamah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنَا أَبِي، قَالَ جَرِيرٌ، عَنْ مُغِيرَةَ، عَنِ الشَّعْبِيِّ، عَنْ مُحَرِّرِ بْنِ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ: قَالَ أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ: كُنْتُ أُنَادِي مَعَ عَلِيٍّ حِينَ أُذِّنَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَكَانَ إِذَا ضَحَلَ صَوْتُهُ، أَوِ اشْتَكَى حَلْقَهُ، أَوْ عَيِيَ مِمَّا يُنَادِي دَعَوْتُ مَكَانَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muharrir from abu Hurayrah: I was calling with `Ali when he called on the pagans, so whenever his voice weakens or his throat hurts or gets tired, I would stand in `Ali’s place and call.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>What early historians say?</u></strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Isma’eel Al-Suddi [d.127] as reported Al-Tabari in tafsir (14/108-109) through Muhammad b. Husain from Ahmed b. Mufaddal from Asbaat from him.</li>
<li>Muhammad b. Ka’b al-Kurazi [d.110] as reported by Al-Tabari in Tafsir (14/100).</li>
<li>Al-Waqidi [d.207] explicitly mentions that when Abu Bakr asked `Ali whether he was used as a leader to lead Hajj, `Ali replied, “No, rather the Prophet has sent me to recite Bara’ah to the people.” Al-Waqidi narrate this from Ma’mar, Muhammad b. Abdullah, Ibn Abi Habiba, Ibn Abi Sabirah, Usama b. Zaid, Haritha b. Abi Imran and Abdul Hameed b. Ja`far. Maghazi [3/1076-1077]</li>
<li>Ibn Ishaq [d. 151] has narrated through Abu Ja`far al-Baqir that when Abu Bakr ra asked `Ali whether he had come as a leader or under [his] leadership, he answer, “Rather I am under [your] leadership.” Ibn Ishaq reports, “Then Abu Bakr led people in Hajj…”</li>
<li>Abu Ja`far al-Tabari [d.310] also mentioned it and reported it through Al-Suddi and Muhammad b. Ka’b al-Kurazi. Tarikh Tabri (3/122).</li>
<li>Ibn Hibban also reported the incident in the same manner in his book “Ath-Thiqaat” [2/113]</li>
<li>Ibn Hazm Az-Zahiri also mentioned it in “Jawami’ as-Seerah” [p.258]</li>
<li>Ibn habib Al-Baghdadi [d.245] mentioned that Abu Bakr led the people in the Hajj of the year 9 AH. Al-Muhabbar [p.12]</li>
<li>Al-Mas’udi also said that Abu Bakr was sent as Ameer of Hajj and then `Ali followed his with the message of Bara’ah. Although he pointed out the differences among the people of Qibla regarding it. At-Tanbih wa al-Ishraf [1/237]</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion: Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the believers to Hajj in place of the Prophet (saw). The Prophet (saw) trusted Abu Bakr to teach people their religion and the new Islamic rituals of pilgrimage. `Ali was sent after Abu Bakr as his underling, since he is a direct blood-relation of the Prophet (saw) he conveyed his message to the pagans and the Arabs. `Ali clearly stated to Abu Bakr that he was not sent as a leader but as Abu Bakr’s follower as reported in authentic traditions of Jabir bin `Abdullah and Muhammad al-Baqir.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Wilayat’s “Abu Bakr &amp; Aisha [Extreme Abusive Language].” The article can be found on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2300:abu-bakr-a-aisha-extreme-abusive-language&amp;catid=176:aisha-bint-abi-bakr&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The article contains several allegations against Sunnism. These include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The Abusive Language of Abu Bakr?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The Alteration of Salafis of the Text to Hide this Act?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; A’isha is Abusive like Abu Bakr?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The Permissibility of Abusing Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- The Abusive Language of Abu Bakr?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The accusation towards Abu Bakr was not given a context by the author of the article, perhaps since the context would weaken the Shi’ee accusation placed against Abu Bakr. The narration, which can be found in <a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19" rel="external nofollow">Saheeh Al-Bukhari</a>, includes a disbeliever who told the Prophet – peace be upon him – “O Muhammad! Won&#8217;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.” In other words, Urwa was reprimanding the Prophet – peace be upon him – for his actions against Quraish, whilst warning him of the disloyalty of his followers. It was only then when Abu Bakr lost his cool and told Urwa to “suck on Al-Laat’s clitoris.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is needless to say that anyone that is familiar with Al-Laat would be aware that it is a statue that was worshiped by the pagan Arabs. More importantly, it did not have a clitoris, but rather, this was a figure of speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration continues without the Prophet – peace be upon him – reprimanding Abu Bakr for his language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, it was never the opinion of Ahl Al-Sunnah that Abu Bakr was an infallible. Though, we do not hold the opinion that Abu Bakr was a foul-mouthed person either. Though, how could this occur in light of the narration above?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the moderate nature of Ahl Al-Sunnah, we do not hold the view that one can be referred to as a foul-mouthed person through one incident. Similarly, one is not branded “a liar” through one lie, for the Prophet – peace be upon him – said, “A person will continue to lie under he is recorded as a liar.” (Saheeh Muslim #4721)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, as well as the other merits of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/01/27/book-virtues-hazrat-abu-bakr/" rel="external nofollow">Abu Bakr that can be found in various authentic narrations</a>, it becomes clear that one should not be labelled as foul-mouthed or immoral from one incident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- The Alteration of Salafis of the Text to Hide this Act?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author, after providing the narration in Arabic, includes an English translation in which the words: “Suck the clitoris of Al-Laat” are translated into a general “abused him” without providing the exact wordings of the abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author comments: <span style="color: #800000;">“But Salafies must realise that this is the disease of Sahaba Worship and making &#8220;Tehrif&#8221; in their books is the same as Jews and Christians who also made Tehrif in their books earlier too.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, this is an improper translation of the text, and the translator, Muhsin Khan, felt that it was problematic to include this translation in his book. In our humble opinion, this action by Muhsin Khan was incorrect. Instead, he should have translated it as it is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, readers should rest assured that this is not a common trait and nobody should be blamed except for the translator. Today, we see Saheeh Al-Bukhari printed in Arabic through many publishers with the correct wording. Moreover, we find that Al-Bukhari himself, and all the narrators in the chain as well, had no issues with providing the exact wording that came from Abu Bakr. In other words, it is unfair for the author to suggest that this is a common occurrence within Sunni and Salafi circles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- A’isha is Abusive like Abu Bakr?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of the article provides a narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort. &#8216;Aisha started replying (Abusing) to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of the article comments:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“When we see these 2 Traditions side by side then we understand completely why Rasool (saw) told Aisha that she is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, if one were to extract two narrations from the tens of thousands of narrations from hadith compilations, one could draw up links between them. However, we maintain the view that Abu Bakr was not known to be foul-mouthed. If we were to look at the narration with objectivity, we would conclude that the Prophet – peace be upon him – is comparing A’isha with Abu Bakr in her strength in character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the Shias will perhaps reject this interpretation, we ask them to provide the proof that Abu Bakr was known to be a foul-mouthed person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, they can ask themselves, “Why would the Prophet – peace be upon him – even tolerate such actions or stay married to such a vile woman?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- The Permissibility of Abusing Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of the article argues the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">“But note here Wivers of RAsool (saw) abusing each other. Both of them are Sahabiaat. Are Nasibies not stick to their Standards here and declare both of them to be Kafirs and issue fatwa of their Killing?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author, who is apparently a bachelor, has apparently never tasted the jealousy of women amongst one another. In this scenario, we have an isolated case in which A’isha and Zaynab abused one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another narration in Muslim #4472, we find her saying about Zaynab, “I have never seen a woman better in religion, god-fearing, more truthful, good to her family, charitable, like Zaynab.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is very much unlike how Shias act towards the Sahaba, in which their abuse towards the Sahaba is a part of their religion and believe that they are getting closer to Allah by abusing the companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him – and his wives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;and no, the TSN Team does not endorse killing Shias or making a blanket <em>takfeer</em> against them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We add, that there are authentic narrations that attribute a similar thing to al-Husayn. We read the following in Tarikh Dimashq, Tarikh ul-Islam and al-Matalib-ul-`Aliyah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وَقَالَ إِسْحَاقُ: أنا إِسْمَاعِيلُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَنِ ابْنِ عَوْنٍ، عَنْ عُمَيْرِ بْنِ إِسْحَاقَ، قَالَ: كَانَ مَرْوَانُ أَمِيرًا عَلَيْنَا سِنِينَ، فَكَانَ يَسُبُّ عَلِيًّا رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ كُلَّ جُمُعَةٍ عَلَى الْمِنْبَرِ، ثُمَّ عُزِلَ مَرْوَانُ، وَاسْتُعْمِلَ سَعِيدُ بْنُ الْعَاصِ سِنِينَ، فَكَانَ لَا يَسُبُّهُ، ثُمَّ عُزِلَ سَعِيدٌ، وَأُعِيدَ مَرْوَانُ، فَكَانَ يَسُبُّهُ، فَقِيلَ لِلْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا: أَلَا تَسْمَعُ مَا يَقُولُ مَرْوَانُ؟ فَلَا تَرَدُّ شَيْئًا؟ إلخ</p>
<p>[Ishaq said, Isma`il bin Ibrahim told us, from Ibn `Awn, from `Umayr bin Ishaq, he said: &#8220;Marwan was our governor for two years and he used to insult `Ali may Allah be pleased with him etc&#8230;]</p>
<p>(He continues in a long narration until al-Husayn tells Marwan&#8217;s messenger)</p>
<p>فَقَالَ الْحُسَيْنُ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: &#8221; أَكَلْتَ بَظْرَ أُمِّكَ إِنْ لَمْ تُبْلِغْهُ عَنِّي مَا أَقُولُ لَهُ</p>
<p>[&#8230; So al-Husayn told him: &#8220;May you eat your mother&#8217;s clitoris if you do not inform him (Marwan) of what I said&#8221;]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Guided’s “Abubakr and Umar <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/09/15/lanat/">CURSED</a> by the Ahl al-Bayt (as) [Part 2]”. The article can be found on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2261:abubakr-and-umar-cursed-by-the-ahl-al-bayt-as-part-2&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided argues: “<span style="color: #800000;">This article is related to the crisis between Sayyidah Fatima (as) and the two accursed one: Abubakr and Umar. The follwoing point stands out VERY BOLD from the crisis: Fatima was angry with Abubakr and Umar till her death. SHE NEVER FORGAVE THEM. And this is the crux of the whole debate. Her anger is the anger of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), while the anger of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) is the Anger of Allah (swt). And whosoever earns Allah&#8217;s Anger, or His Prophet&#8217;s (pbuh), he is CURSED both in this world and the next. We have already detailed the proofs for all these points in the aforementioned articles.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before even getting into the logical gymnastics that have gone so wrong in the argument above, one needs to first establish some factors before assuming that Abu Bakr and Omar are cursed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If someone were to anger Fatima accidentally, due to a misunderstanding, would that make someone cursed for all eternity? What if someone stepped on her toe accidentally? Surely eternal punishment would not be the retaliation of a fair god.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We maintain the position that angering the <em>awliya&#8217; </em>of Allah does in fact anger Him, as per Saheeh Al-Bukhari #6021. (Also see <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2013/05/16/the-prophet-saws-only-gets-angry-for-fatima-ra/" rel="external nofollow">this article</a> for more examples on.) However, this occurs only when one inexcusably and purposefully intends to harm them. This also begs the question, what if one of the <em>awliya’</em> of Allah harms another one of the <em>awliya’</em> of Allah? We currently do not hold an answer to that question.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to Abu Bakr and Omar, we do not find any evidences that Omar angered Fatima through authentic narrations, while we hold the opinion that Abu Bakr angered Fatima due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided argues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">4.</span> Considering that she never forgave them, then Allah IS still angry with both of them!</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #800000;">Therefore, both are ACCURSED in both this world and the next!</span>”</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find the double-standards ironic. The argument is that Fatima remained angry until her death means that she remains angry until the Day of Judgment. This is especially baseless from a Shia perspective, which holds that Fatima is currently taking part in world affairs, responding to calls of intercession, and perhaps even participating in creating, as per the extreme views of some Shias.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask: Even if we assume that Fatima was angered at Abu Bakr up until the time of her death, is it not possible for her to forgive him after her death since she is pretty much alive according to Shia thought?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias seem to forget that Abu Bakr does show remorse in regards to the <u>alleged</u> attack on Fatima, and this has been argued on both the <a href="http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=12863" rel="external nofollow">Imam Reza website</a> and on <a href="http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/fadak/shia-position-abu-bakr.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If Shias want to believe that Fatima is still angry over a monetary disagreement for a thousand and four-hundred years, then that is their issue, but Ahl Al-Sunnah do not believe that this is befitting of her character, for even pious non-Muslims have been known to forgive those that have wronged them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Guided also provides a narration that suggests that the Prophet – peace be upon him – told Fatima that Allah becomes angry when she becomes angry. We have commented on this meaning above, but we like to add that the narration is weak according to Al-Thahabi, who weakened it in his commentary on Al-Mustadrak due to the weakness of Al-Hussain bin Zaid.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Hasan Molai’s “Concept of ahlubait regarding caliphate of sheikhain-2: sahih sunni chain.” The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/concept-of-ahlubait-regarding-caliphate-of-sheikhain-2-sahih-sunni-chain/" rel="external nofollow">Slave of Ahlubait’s blog</a> and the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2251:concept-of-ahlubait-regarding-caliphate-of-sheikhain-2-sahih-sunni-chain&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration presented states that, “<span style="color: #800000;">A</span><span style="color: #800000;">bu Bakar was delivering khutba one day when came imam Hasan; so He said: Step down from my Father’s Pulpit; so Ali asws said I did not tell him.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration provided is weak because Urwa bin Al-Zubair was born after the death of Abu Bakr. So, the very title of the article is fraudulent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, even if the narration was authentic, it would be proof for Ahl Al-Sunnah and not against them, for it shows that Ali did not back up the statement of his son and did not resist Abu Bakr’s usurpation of the caliphate. On the contrary, he denied that he ever told his very own children that he was the rightful heir to the caliphate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Guided’s “Illegality of Abubakr&#8217;s Caliphate”. The article was can be found on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2256:illegality-of-abubakrs-caliphate&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided argues: “<span style="color: #993300;">A common lie by our Sunni brothers is that Abubakr led the prayers during the fatal illness of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (pbuh). We believe this to be a lie because the Holy Prophet (pbuh) said that only Imam Ali (as) was legally qualified to act in his stead. In other words, whenever the Holy Prophet (pbuh) is not physically available to perform any of his roles, either we wait for him to return or let Imam Ali (as) do it. NO ONE ELSE COULD ACT IN THE STEAD OF ALLAH&#8217;S APOSTLE.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a consensus amongst both Sunnis and Shias that the Prophet – peace be upon him – let others perform his role when he was not present. The most common cited evidence for this is that he and Ali would be out of Madinah during an expedition, so he would have Ibn Um Maktoom, Mohammad bin Maslamah, or someone else as his caliph in Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided then quotes a narration to support his position:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><span style="color: #993300;">Shaykh al-Albani records in his Kitab al-Sunnah, p. 550:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;">Ali is from me and I am from him, and no one can act in my stead save myself or Ali.</span><strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided does not provide a context for the report, which is why he has fallen into this contradiction. These words were uttered by the Prophet – peace be upon him – according to Abu Ja’afar Al-Baqir in the Seerah of Ibn Hisham 2/461 when the Prophet – peace be upon him – sent Ali to give testimony of the new pact between him and the people of Quraish. The narration also explicitly shows that Abu Bakr was the leader of the pilgrimage as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Guided’s “Why Abubakr Attacked Fatima&#8217;s House &#8211; Ibn Taymiyyah”. The article can be found on the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2257:why-abubakr-attacked-fatimas-house-ibn-taymiyyah&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided quotes and translates Ibn Taymiyyah’s commentary on what happened between Abu Bakr and Fatima:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“<span style="color: #800000;">The reason for what is said that he (Abubakr) broke into the house (of Fatima) was to see if there was some thing of Allah&#8217;s money to distribute it or give it to those who deserved it.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guided comments: “<span style="color: #800000;">Ibn Taymiyyah here is attempting to defend why Abubakr broke into Fatima&#8217;s (as) house. The word he has used كبس means to forcefully break into something. This shows that Abubakr gave an order for his thugs to break the door into Fatima&#8217;s (as) house and search it. He levelled two grievous allegations against her:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Fatima (as) was suspected of having stolen Allah&#8217;s (swt) money</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Fatima (as) was suspected of having illegal property in her possession!</span>”</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement by Ibn Taymiyyah is taken out of context, since the previous paragraph he rejects the narration that suggests that Abu Bakr mistreated those that were with Fatima. He argues, “The incrimination cannot be accepted without an authentic chain and needs to be a clear evidence for incrimination, and if one of the two is missing, one cannot be incriminated.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah then proceeds by suggesting that even if we were to accept that he entered the house of Fatima, it was not for the sake of harming anyone, since the narration does not state that, but rather, that he was looking for money to be distributed, since that is why houses are barged into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, the narration shows a remorseful Abu Bakr, who believe that he should have no acted in such a way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We remind readers again that this narration has not been affirmed as authentic in the first place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following article is a response to Slave of Ahlubait’s “Attack on house of bibi fatima; from sunni sources”. The article can be found on the <a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2255:attack-on-house-of-bibi-fatima-from-sunni-sources&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slave of Ahlubait, in the article, provides a narration that Abu Bakr intruded into the house of Fatima. The narration does not provide any information regarding any harm being done to those within the house, however, we cannot even accept that such an intrusion occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah points out that this accusation cannot be accepted unless if comes through an authentic chain, and we know for a fact that Abu Bakr did not cause any harm to Ali or Al-Zubair or Sa’ad bin Ubada. He then states that all that can be said is that Abu Bakr intruded into the house to check if there was any money that needed to be spent, though Ibn Taymiyyah is simply playing the devil’s advocate, since he rejects the narration in the first place. See Minhaj Al-Sunnah 8/290.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slave of Ahlubait is successful in providing a chain for the hadiths that he found in Kitab Al-Amwal by Ibn Zanjawaih.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chain is obviously weak due to the weakness of Ulwan bin Dawud, who was weakened by Al-Bukhari, Ibn Yunus, and Al-Uqaili. Refer to Mizan Al-I’itidal 5/135.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Qutlubugha 7/176 provides the same quotes from the previous three sources as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Al-Jawzi in his Al-Dhu’afaa also quotes Ibn Yunus who weakened Ilwan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, Slave of Ahlubait rejects these criticisms, suggesting that this opinion was falsely attributed to Al-Bukhari and Ibn Yunus, since none of their published books contain this information. This argument is baseless since such statements are accepted even without the publication of these books, for it is enough that they have been documented by late sources, and this is the methodology of the late hadith scholars in regards to <em>rijali</em> statements by early scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slave of Ahlubait does argue that “<span style="color: #800000;">he is termed thiqa by ibn habban, though some people have criticized him but that is not explanatory enough.</span>” However, as anyone who is experienced in hadith sciences knows, Ibn Hibban includes people in his book that he does not even know.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Slave of Ahlubait’s “heirs of holy prophet and their right upon on the property of holy prophet (asws)”. The article can be found on <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/heirs-of-holy-prophet-and-their-right-upon-on-the-property-of-holy-prophet-asws/" rel="external nofollow">his blog</a> and the <a href="http://wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2254:heirs-of-holy-prophet-and-their-right-upon-on-the-property-of-holy-prophet-asws&amp;catid=174:abu-bakr-1st-caliph&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat website. </a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration was translated as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>“abu tufail says that when holy prophet asws died, bibi fatima asws sent a messenger to abu bakar and asked him</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>are you the heir of holy prophet asws or his family?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>he replied: heir of holy prophet asws are his family</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>so she asked: where is the part of holy prophet?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>he said: i heard holy prophet asws myself that when allah makes his prophet eat something, and then calls him back; then the right of its control is with the one who is the caliph of time; so i consider it appropriate to distribute it amongst muslims; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>upon hearing this all, bibi fatima asws said: you know better what you heard;”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The screenshot presented by Slave of Ahlubait includes the statement by Ibn Katheer who said: “The wordings of this narration have <em>nakara </em>(are objectionable) and are strange.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Albani commented in Irwa Al-Ghaleel: “This narration’s chain is <em>hasan</em> and the narrators are trustworthy <u>except</u> that Ibn Jumai’, who happens to be [Al-Waleed bin Abdullah] bin Jumai’ is weakened by some because of his <em>dhabt.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration contains a contradiction, since it is the only narration that includes Abu Bakr saying that the family of the Prophet – peace be upon him – inherit from him, while all the other narrations and the historical reality show that nobody inherited anything from him, but everything went to charity. What makes it stranger is that Fatima, at the end of the narration, accepts Abu Bakr’s claim that he will take control, a minute after he admitted that the Prophet’s inheritance is to be given to his heirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no doubt that the root of the confusion is Al-Waleed bin Jumai’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon further research, we find that there is a similar narration in Musnad Ahmad #57, that contains similar information, but without the contradiction. Abu Salama narrates that Fatima asked Abu Bakr, “Who would inherit from you if you died?” He replied, “My children and family.” This fits in more with the narration of Ibn Jumai’ in which she asks, “Who inherited the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; ?” In which he responded, “His family.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, this narration is also weak since Abu Salama did not hear from Abu Bakr or Fatima, so the narration is disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, this narration is more acceptable than the narration of Ibn Jumai’ since it does not contradict the historical reality and does not include contradictions.</p>
