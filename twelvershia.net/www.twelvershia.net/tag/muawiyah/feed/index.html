<h1 style="text-align: justify;">On Jonathan Brown’s Accusation against Mu’awiyah</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a brief response to Jonathan Brown’s accusations against Mu’awiyah from his “Misquoting Muhammad”. Unlike most of our refutations, this article refutes an accusation made by a Sunni, Dr. Jonathan Brown, may Allah guide him, for his statement has started making its rounds in Shia circles, and thus, a response is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He states on p. 22:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mu’awiyah himself encouraged his followers to forge Hadiths detracting from the standing of his opponents, the Shiah supporters of Ali and his descendants.”</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He references Ahmad bin Sa’d Al-Din Al-Miswari’s “Al-Risala Al-Munqitha,” who allegedly quotes from Al-Mada’ini’s “Al-Ahdaath.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Attribution to Al-Mada’ini</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first issue is the attribution of the narration to Al-Mada’ini. Al-Miswari, who is an extreme Shi’ee, quotes this narration, then mentions Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed’s quoting of a narration by Niftawayh. Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed, who passes away in the seventh century, does not even hold the view that Mu’awiyah is a Muslim, and states that he is accused of <em>zandaqa.</em> Refer to his commentary on the 25<sup>th</sup> speech for a demonstration of his hatred for Mu’awiyah and accuses his mother of debauchery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be noted that we are not aware of any book by Al-Mada’ini called “Al-Ahdaath”. The lengthiest lists of his works have been compiled by Ibn Al-Nadeem, in his Fihrist, and Yaqut Al-Hamawi, in his Mu’jam, and neither contain a book named “Al-Ahdaath.” We do find the names of books that fall under the category of “Al-Ahdaath”, yes, but there is a difference between a category and the title of a book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, even if we accepted that Al-Mada’ini did write this, we cannot accept the reliability of the report since Al-Mada’ini, who passed away in the third century (225 AH), does not include a chain of transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Edit: Updated on 07:30 AM (GMT) &#8211; 28/1/2017<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Brown has published some posts in where he has clarified his position in regards to the narration. As we can see below, he does not endorse the narration of Al-Mada&#8217;ini.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG-20170128-WA0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3694 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG-20170128-WA0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG-20170128-WA0002.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3695 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG-20170128-WA0002-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></h1>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Muawiyah and Talbiya at Arafa</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to <a href="http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/muawiya/phantom-merits.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen</a> and Slave of Ahlubait&#8217;s accusation (which can be found on his <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/mawia-leaving-sunnah-in-grudge-for-imam-ali-authentic-narration/" rel="external nofollow">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2651:mawia-leaving-sunnah-in-grudge-for-imam-ali-authentic-narration&amp;catid=187:muawiyyah&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat.net</a>) against Mu’awiyah of abandoning the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration used to suggest this is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Saeed bin Jubair said: ‘We were with ibn Abbas in Arafa and he said to me: ‘Oh Saeed, why don’t I hear the people performing talbya?’ I replied: ‘They are afraid of Muawiya’. Then ibn Abbas went out from his cottage and said: ‘I respond to your call, Oh Allah I respond to your call, they abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali (ra).</strong><strong><br />
</strong>1. Sunan Nasai, Volume 5 page 253 Tradition 3019</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> 2.  Sahih Ibn Khuzaima, Volume 4 page 260 Tradition 2830</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> 3. Mustadrak al-Hakim, Volume 1 pages 364-365</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before even refuting this allegation, those that don’t speak the Arabic language need to be aware that the term <em>talbiya</em> is the call that we find the pilgrims practicing during Hajj, in which they shout: <em>Labayk Allahuma labaik</em>, meaning: O’ my Lord, I’ve answered your call and I’m at your service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the Shias use this tradition to suggest that Mu’awiyah not only abandoned the Sunnah, but that he was against <em>dhikr</em> as a whole. However, simply by critically examining this narration, we arrive at a completely different conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, there is nothing in the narration that suggests that Mu’awiyah was anti-<em>dhikr</em> or anti-Islam from this narration. Rather, the narration revolves around the time in which <em>talbiya</em> is to be made. According to Mu’awiyah, <em>talbiya</em> is made at Hajj, but not at Arafa in specific.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why we find Ibn Abi Shayba 3/356 including this hadith in a chapter that he titled: <em>Takbir </em>or <em>talbiya</em>, what is better during Arafa?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter, he included several narrations that suggest both views. One includes a narration from Ibn Umar saying that he prefers <em>takbir</em>. In a narration from Abu Ja’afar, we find him stopping <em>talbiya</em> on his way to Arafa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another chapter 3/248 he quotes that Al-Qasim bin Mohammad bin Abi Bakr and A’isha did not make <em>talbiya</em> when on their way to Arafa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another matter that should catch the reader’s attention is Ibn Abbas’ specific wording: “They abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali.” Now, why would Ibn Abbas name Ali in particular? This suggests that <em>talbiya</em> was not as common at Arafa before Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is supported by a narration from Musanaf Ibn Abi Shayba 3/356, where in which <em>talbiya</em> was heard. Surprised, they asked, “Who is making <em>talbiya</em> on this day?!” When they found out that it was Ibn Mas’ud, they went silent. Ibn Mas’ud died during the time of Uthman, which suggests that he made <em>talbiya</em> before Ali’s time, and yet, the practice as not too common.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, we can conclude that Mu’awiyah did not intentionally go against the <em>sunnah</em>, but rather, acted upon what he believed was the correct Hajj etiquette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, we find that the Umawi government, under Umar bin Abdulaziz, did the exact opposite of Mu’awiyah, as per Muwatta Malik #660. When he heard people making <em>takbir</em>, he sent his guards to call out to the people, “O’ people! Make <em>talbiya</em> (instead)!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which action is more correct, the purpose of this article was to not to analyze the correct position, but rather, to demonstrate that Mu’awiyah made <em>ijtihad</em>, as did others before him, and held the belief that the proper Hajj protocol was to make <em>takbir</em> instead of <em>talbiya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no evidences in the narration that remotely suggest that he purposefully went against the <em>sunnah</em>, or took this position to contradict Ali’s actions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Al-Mufeed’s biography of Imam Hasan, which can be found in <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/articles/imam-al-hasan-second-imam-brief-look-his-life" rel="external nofollow">al-islam.org</a>. The piece, after being translated into English from the original Kitab Al-Irshad (Book of Guidance), was entitled: “Imam Hasan (as), A Brief Look into His Life”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before examining the details of the life of Imam Hasan, it is important to first know that Kitab Al-Irshad, by Al-Mufeed, is the most authoritative book of history that has been produced by the Shias. Unlike Ahl Al-Sunnah, Shias struggle with the subject of history, due to the lack of works produced by the sect. If compared to early sources of Sunni history, like Seerat Ibn Hisham, Tareekh Al-Tabari and Tareekh Ibn Khayyat it becomes too clear that Shias cannot compete with Ahl Al-Sunnah in this field. This article will make it a point to prove just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have divided the response into 4 parts:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Criticism of the Source of the Biography of Imam Hasan’s Caliphate</li>
<li>Criticisms of the Text</li>
<li>Who Killed Imam Hasan?</li>
<li>Imam Hasan’s Burial</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 1. Criticism of the Source of the Biography of Imam Hasan’s Caliphate</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed’s biography of Imam Hasan in the original Arabic is six and a half pages long. The first page contains basic information like his date of birth and a couple of his merits. The next four pages list out his reign as a caliph. The last page and a half document his death and burial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed provides only one source for the four pages about Imam Hasan’s caliphate.</p>
<blockquote><p>He states: “Abu Mikhnaf Lut b. Yahya al-Azdi reported: Ashath b. Suwar told me on the authority of Abu Ishaq al-Sabi’i and others, who said…”</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon returning to the summary of Al-Khoei’s Mu’jam of Rijal, which was condensed by Al-Jawahiri, we find that Ashath (p. 73) and Abu Ishaq (p. 434) are both unknown narrators (Note: They are Sunni). Furthermore, Al-Tusturi, in Qamoos Al-Shia 8/619-620 argues that Lut bin Yahya, who extensively wrote about the early Shia Imams, was not even an Imami, but a general (political) Shi’ee, and such a term is used very loosely, to the extent that even famous Sunni Imams like Sufyan Al-Thawri was referred to as a (political) Shi’ee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even from a non-Rijali perspective, the narrations of Lut bin Yahya are extremely dubious due to the fact that they usually contain secret letters and documents between opposing armies and rulers as we shall soon see below. How is it that Lut bin Yahya had exclusive access to all these documents?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, the full four pages cannot be relied upon by Shias due to the weakness of the chain. A problematic aspect of Al-Mufeed’s rendition of the caliphate of Imam Hasan is that he often does not differentiate between his own words and the word from the narration. Thus, it is difficult to tell if the narration was kept in its original form or if he is putting it in his own words.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Criticisms of the Text</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several issues with the text itself that deserve to be mentioned. For some of them contradict what has been authentically established while others contradict logic altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) <em>Imam Hasan’s Sermon</em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>He said, “The Apostle of God, may God bless him and his family, used to send him forward with his standard while Gabriel supported him on his right and Michael supported him on his left.”</li>
<li>He said, “I am of the House, from who God has sent away abomination.” [<strong>Comment</strong>: This implies that his household contained abominations until it was sent away.]</li>
<li>He said, “I am of the House for whom God has required love in his Book, when God, the Most High, said: Say: I do not ask for you any reward except love for (my) kin.” [<strong>Comment</strong>: This has been responded to thoroughly in our audio lecture <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/05/16/murajaat-verses-in-favor-of-ali/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.]</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) <em>Mu’awiyah’s Spies and Assassins</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the death of Ali, the narration of Lut bin Yahya Abu Mikhnaf suggests that Mu’awiyah sent spies who were to assassinate and provide intelligence. The narration contains several letters back and forth with Imam Hasan criticizing Mu’awiyah for his actions. He accuses him of being haughty about the death of Ali. However, Al-Mufeed disliked Mu’awiyah’s letter and decided not to mention it. He says: “Muawiya replied to him with his letter, which there is no need to mention.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon returning to Maqatil Al-Talibiyeen by Abu Al-Faraj Al-Isbahani (p. 250) (Zaydi historian) we find what Al-Mufeed did not want to share. The narration contains a firm Mu’awiyah who declared that “I was not saddened, nor happy, nor was I haughty, nor did I grieve.” He then included a line of poetry that suggests that Ali was an enemy, but that he admired Ali’s generous character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed chose to include this text in order to not share the shades of grey in Mu’awiyah’s character. Surely, to keep the Shia layman in the dark is preferred than to make Mu’awiyah appear as anything more than a one dimensional villain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) <em>In Accountant in the Court of Mu’awiyah bin Abi Sufyan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the title of this little section suggests, something fishy is going on in first century Damascus. Al-Mufeed narrates that Mu’awiyah sent Ju’da the wife of Imam Hasan a hundred thousand dirhams (538,000 SAR) in order to assassinate her husband. He also promised her the hand of Yazeed. A couple of pages back, Mu’awiyah sent Ubaidullah bin Abbas ten times the same amount (5,380,000 SAR) to leave the ranks of Imam Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refer to our other article <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/07/22/response-to-al-hadith-analysis-and-an-overview/" rel="external nofollow">here</a> about Mu’awiyah asking Samura to narrate a fabricated hadith for the price of (2,153,900 SAR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is not only that these fabrications are based on anonymous narrators, but that the numbers do not make any sense. Why would the assassination of Imam Hasan cost four times less than fabricating a narration? Why would his assassination cost ten times less than bribing Ubaidullah bin Abbas? Why was it so expensive to narrate a fabrication anyway?! People would fabricate narrations pro bono all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) <em>Conditions of the Settlement</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed details the conditions as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the cursing of the Commander of the faithful, peace be upon him, should be abandoned and the practice of using the personal prayer (qunut) in the formal prayer (salat) (as prayer) against him should be set aside; that his Shia, may God be pleased with them, should be given security and that none of them should be exposed to any evil; that each of them who had certain rights should attain those rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, Al-Mufeed states that Mu’awiyah betrayed Imam Hasan by saying in a sermon, “All of them (the conditions) are now under my foot. And from now on I will not fulfill anything.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, Al-Mufeed gives this explanation as to why Imam Hasan agreed to such a deal in the first place:</p>
<blockquote><p>Al-Hasan, peace be upon him, did not trust him. He was aware of his deception and his attempts at assassination. However, he could find no escape from assenting to his demands to abandon the war and bring about a truce because of the weakness of his followers’ understanding of his right, their corrupt attitude towards him and their opposition to him. (In addition, he was aware) of the view of many of them in declaring it lawful to shed his blood and to hand him over to his rival.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Hasan’s position according to Al-Mufeed contradicts the condition. Why would Imam Hasan ask for security of Shias that don’t believe in his Imamate and want him dead?! IMPORTANT: Al-Mufeed provides no source for his narration that detail the conditions of Imam Hasan.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Who Killed Imam Hasan?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed provides two narrations that detail the death of Imam Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The first narration</strong></em> is from Al-Mugheera bin Miqsam (d. 136 AH) who states that Mu’awiyah sent a hundred thousand dirhams to the wife of Imam Hasan to kill him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The second narration</strong></em> is from Umar [Umair] bin Ishaq, a contemporary of Imam Hasan. The Imam, in this narration rebukes Al-Hussain for wanting to know the identity of his killer. He then says, “Do you want to kill (my killer)? If it is who I think it is, then Allah will be more vengeful. If it is not, then I do not want my death to lead to the cause of the death of an innocent person!”<br />
The narration clearly shows that Imam Hasan had no idea who his killer was, unlike the previous disconnected narration that claims that Mu’awiyah did it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: The faulty translation provided on al-islam.org from the above quote is as follows: “If he may remain as he is, then God will be more terrible in His vengeance than you. If he may not remain as he is, then I should like to be free of any blame.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We provide the Arabic text for readers to determine which translation is the correct one:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إن يكن هو هو فالله أشد نقمة منك وإن لم يكن هو فما أحب أن يؤخذ بي بريء</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Imam Hasan’s Burial</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed provides a single account here. He narrates from Abdullah bin Ibrahim from Ziyad Al-Makharqi. There is not enough evidence to determine who Abdullah bin Ibrahim is, while nothing can be found in Shia books of Rijal about Ziyad Al-Makharqi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This far-fetched narration includes the following words from Imam Hasan to his brother: “Carry me on my bier to the grave of my grandfather, the Apostle of God, may God bless him and his family, so that I may renew my covenant with him. After that take me to the grave of my grandmother, Fatima the daughter of Asad, may God be pleased with her, and bury me there.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration ends with A’isha riding a mule, under the suspicion that Imam Hasan was going to be buried in her house.  She cries: “What is there between you and me that you should allow someone I don’t want to enter my house?” Marwan too appears to prevent this burial from taking place. This is the account provided by Al-Mufeed and an earlier Shia scholar Abu Faraj Al-Isbahani.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Faraj though, provides another narration in his Maqatil Al-Talibiyeen (p. 36) that states that Imam Hasan sent someone to request from A’isha to be buried in her house. She agreed. Bani Umayyah, upon hearing of this, gathered and brought weapons, for they would not allow this and said: By Allah, he is not to ever be buried with the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; ! Imam Hasan, upon receiving word, said, “There is no need for it, bury me beside my mother, Fatima – peace be upon her &#8211; .”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This second account is a more reasonable one that doesn’t insult the intellect, for it doesn’t contain any renewal of covenant to the Prophet (saw) after his death (which is unheard of), nor does it contain an Imam with knowledge of the unseen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…and praise be to Allah the Most Gracious Most Merciful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article entitled: “Mawia Drinking what was Prohibited by Holy Prophet”. The article can be found <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2010/07/18/mawia-the-drinkersahih-narration/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this short article, SoA quotes the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Abdullah bin Buraida said that I went to Mawia alongwith my father; Mawia made us sit on the floor with respect; food was brought for us; and that was followed by drink (wine); Mawia drank it; and gave it to my father; my father replied that he has not drink it from the time Holy Prophet has forbidden it; Mawia said that I was the most beautiful man of Quraish with smart neck; and did not enjoy anything other than milk and nice conversation</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the narration appears to imply that what was brought was indeed an intoxicant, there is an alternative interpretation that we would rather share. Firstly, the narration does not say that the drink that was brought was wine. It simply says that a drink was brought.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Buraida says that he didn’t drink “it” since the time of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), it appears as though he is talking about intoxicants in general. It is not necessary that he is talking about the drink that was brought to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems as though the drink that was brought was milk, since Mu’awiyah himself is praising milk and saying that it is his favorite drink ever since he was young. It is not likely for Mu’awiyah to be praising milk and saying that he enjoys nothing but milk while he is drinking an intoxicant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, even though this interpretation may seem farfetched, it is supported by the following tradition from Ibn Abi Shaybah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>حدثنا زيد بن الحباب عن حسين بن واقد قال حدثنا عبد الله بن بريدة قال : قال : دخلت أنا وأبي على معاوية فأجلس أبي على السرير وأتى بالطعام فأطعمنا ، وأتى بشراب فشرب ، فقال معاوية ، ما شئ كنت أستلذة وأنا شاب فأخذه اليوم إلا اللبن ، فإني آخذه كما كنت آخذه قبل اليوم ، والحديث الحسن.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My father and I entered upon Mu’awiyah, and he made us sit on the bed and brought us some food and drink. He then drank. Then he said: There is nothing that I enjoyed as a young man that I still consume today like <em>laban</em> (milk), for I consume today like I consumed it in the past, and a good conversation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the text shows, the first narration includes a conversation about intoxicants that isn’t present in the second narration. The second narration clearly dictates that it is milk that was consumed during this conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason to hold the view that Mu’awiyah did not consume intoxicants is because he is one of the Sahaba that ordered the lashing of those that drank alcohol. See Musnad Ahmad #16244, #16256, #16265, #16283, and #16318.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, it is not fathomable that he would narrate such narrations and drink it, while at the same time randomly be praising milk in the same narration.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shihristani suggests in his “The Prohibition of Recording Hadith” (p. 217-218) that Muawiyah has extended the limitations that were set by Omar in his reign. Like Uthman though, there are no evidences that he ever issued a ban on the documentation of Hadiths.  As for the limitation, Al-Shihristani quotes a number of reports to establish this belief:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Muawiyah ibn Abi-Sufyan (during his reign) said, “O People: reduce reporting from Messenger of Allah; and when you do, you must report traditions that were known during the reign of `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- It has been also narrated that al-Yahsubi said that he once heard Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan saying to the publics, “Beware of spreading the Hadith except those that were known during the reign of `Umar ibn al-Khattab for this man used to threaten people for the sake of Almighty Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Similarly, it has been narrated on the authority of Ibn `Adi that Isma`il ibn `Ubaydullah confirmed that Muawiyah (ibn Abi-Sufyan) warned people against circulating any tradition that is reported from the Holy Prophet excluding these which were known during the reign of `Umar and admitted by him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three narrations above are similar in meaning and the second narration was narrated by Muslim. As for the third narration, it includes weak additions, which are the words “admitted by him”. It is weak since Isma’eel bin Ubaidullah was born after the death of Muawiyah. See his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third narration also implies that all the Hadiths that are permissible for narrating are ones that were known and accepted by Omar. This is unlike the first two narrations that simply suggest that anything can be narrated as long as it was narrated during the reign of Omar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there are no issues with the first two Hadiths, since Muawiyah is simply forbidding people to narrate what was not narrated in the early years of Islam. Logically, this “ban” only affects narrations that have come into existence during the time of Uthman, Ali, and Muawiyah. In other words, Muawiyah is implying that narrations that were not known or heard by anyone during the time of the Prophet – peace be upon him – , or the first two reigns, should not be reported at all, since fabrications in Hadiths did not occur during that early era of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is echoed by Mohammad bin Sireen in Saheeh Muslim #27 when he said, “They didn’t ask about the chain of narrations before, but when the <em>fitnah </em>occurred (the death of Uthman), they began to say: ‘Name us your men (the narrators).’”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These words by Ibn Sireen tell the same story that Muawiyah does, that it was during the time of Uthman that fabrications started to occur. However, Ibn Sireen explains that there was a different methodology used, which was to ask for Hadith chains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muawiyah’s methods, on the other hand, seem to be stricter, or seem to imply that the narrations that were spread during the time of Omar were only the narrations of other companions that were known to all men in that generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, the words of Muawiyah in the narration are not to be taken as an outright ban, but rather, it is a warning to Muslims to not narrate narrations that came out of nowhere post-Omar, for they most likely contain fabrications. It is silly to assume that Muawiyah was running an Orwellian society that had spy-cams behind every nook and cranny for such a prohibition to be implemented. The proof is that many people both during his reign and after it narrated traditions that even condemn Muawiyah himself, and these are all recorded in our books today as neither he nor those who came after him had the ability to stop the fabricators from fabricating and spreading rumors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The question that begs to be asked is: Would relying on narrations that were strictly narrated during the time of Omar cause us to lose narrations?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is safe to assume, that in the eyes of Muawiyah, everything that was authentic or that falls within the realm of Islamic Law, was already in circulation during the time of Muawiyah, and that the religion will survive with it, for Allah promised that His religion will be preserved within the Qur’an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…and praise be to Allah – the most gracious and most merciful &#8211; .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article entitled: <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2010/08/26/prophet-asws-curses-mawia-sunnis-scholars-hide-the-name/" rel="external nofollow">Prophet asws Curses Mawia, Sunni Scholars Hide the Name. </a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, SoA quotes a narration several times, while admitting that all of them are weak. In the process, SoA makes the argument that Sunnis have tampered with the narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In short, the weak narration can be found in Musnad Abi Ya’ala, and within it we find that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) asks Allah to damn two men. In Al-Suyuti’s Al-La’aali’ Al-Masnoo’a, he damns Mu’awiyah and Amr bin Al-Aas. This has led SoA to the conclusion that Sunnis have tampered with their books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA argues:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">look carefully, in the very beginning sayooti said it is from abu yala </span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">and he mentioned the names as mawia and amr bin aas</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA doesn’t seem to be aware that Abu Ya’ala had more than one book. In fact, the published copy of Al-Musnad by Abu Ya’ala that has arrived to us today is a much shortened version of what was available to scholars in the past. See Siyar A’alam Al-Nubala’a 1/861.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there are other evidences that suggest that this is a different hadith, including the fact that there are variations in the text that are irrelevant to Nasibi inclinations. These include one version including that this happened during travels, when the other doesn’t. One version says that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) heard two people singing, while the other says he heard the sound of singing. One version includes a line of poetry, while the other doesn’t. Also, the second narration includes Ali bin Al-Munthir as the shaikh of Abu Ya’ala and the removal of Abu Hilal from the chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As any objective reader can see, this hadith is a different hadith from the first. Therefore, it is not fair to accuse modern publishers, scribes, or anyone for tampering with the book of Abu Ya’ala, since there are no evidences of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; was not known for <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/09/15/lanat/"><em>lanat</em></a>, which is additional proof that such narrations should not be accepted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article, which he entitled: “Mawia Charging a Sahabi with Madness upon hearing a Hadeeth: Authentic Narration.” The article was published on the 4th of March, 2012, and can be found <a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/mawia-charging-a-sahabi-with-madness-upon-hearing-a-hadeeth-authentic-narration/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA quotes:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">hazrat hunzila narrates that once i was sitting with mawia when two men came fighting. each of them said that he martyred hazrat ammar (r.a). abdullah bin amr said: each of you should congratulate eachother because i had heard holy prophet asws saying that ammar would be killed by rebel group. mawia said:why are you then with us? o amr (mawia is speaking to his father now)! why do you not make us free of his mad person of yours? he replied: once my father complained to holy prophet about me. and he told me to obey my father for whole of my life. and not to disobey him. that is why i am with you, but not there in fights</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">[musnad ahmad, urdu version, vol 3, page 641, narration 6929]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Then SoA comments:<br />
<span style="color: #800000;">so, what we learn from this is that mawia did not accept the hadeeth of sahabi just on the ground that he was sahabi</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">also, we see that he charged him with madness</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response we say: The narration does not indicate that Mu’awiyah rejected the narration of Abdullah bin Amr. His comments are made because he does not see the logic in Abdullah bin Amr’s actions. For one that believes himself to be on the side of the “rebels”, who is condemning his own party, would not usually stick with the same group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In another authentic narration, in Musnad Ahmad #17110, we find Mu’awiyah’s first reaction to the news that Ammar was killed and to the hadith, which in this case was narrated by Amr bin Al-Aas. He said, “We killed him?! It was Ali and his companions that tossed him upon our spears/swords that did it!” Since they allowed `Ammar to fight while he was above ninety years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As we can see in this narration, Mu’awiyah is not rejecting the narration, but using it as evidence against Ali. He does not accuse Amr bin Al-Aas either, for he believes that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said those words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span> We do not agree with Mu’awiyah’s interpretation of the hadith, but we have included it in order to show that he did accept the narration as authentic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following is a response to Wilayat.net’s article “Rasool Allah’s Curse upon Muawiyyah.” The article can be found <a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2660:rasool-curse-upon-muawiyyah-ever-hungry&amp;catid=187:muawiyyah&amp;lang=en" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The article opens with the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Sahih Muslim, Book 032, Number 6298:</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">Ibn Abbas reported: I was playing with children that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by (us). I hid myself behind the door. He (the Holy Prophet) came and he patted upon my shoulders and said: Go and call Mu&#8217;awiya. I returned and said: He is busy in taking food. He again asked me to go and call Mu&#8217;swiya to him. I went (and came back) and said that he was busy in taking food, whereupon he said: May Allah not fill his belly! Ibn Muthanna, said: I asked Umm Umayya what he meant by the word Hatani. He said: It means&#8221; he patted my shoulders&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authors at Wilayat.net go on to suggest that Mu’awiyah is a kaffir by providing external evidences. However, before moving on, there is a need to examine if this narration within itself is sufficient to reach this conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1- Does the Invocation upon Mu’awiyah make him a Disbeliever?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After scrutinizing the meaning of the Hadith and suggested interpretations by scholars, we failed to find evidences that this implies that Mu’awiyah was a kaffir. The narration simply states that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) invoked Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to cause Mu’awiyah’s belly to not be filled. It does not state that he invoked Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to damn Mu’awiyah to the hellfire. Surely, the offense that Mu’awiyah committed is not worthy of eternal damnation. Our Prophet (saw) was very merciful and caring, he was like a father to us, a mercy for all mankind, and he wouldn’t just go about cursing people for the smallest of offenses and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if a Shi’ee were to argue that disobeying a direct order from the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) will always warrant eternal damnation in all cases, then one can simply argue that disobeying Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) is a greater crime. In other words, every sin warrants eternal damnation according to their explanation from missing prayer to gazing at women lustfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, there is evidence that the Prophet’s (salalahu alaihi wa salam) invocations, even when coming to pass, is not conclusive evidence that a person is a kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read in Sharh Saheeh Muslim 13/192 that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A man ate in front of the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) with his left hand. He (the Prophet) said, “Eat with your right (hand),” He said, “I cannot,” He replied, “May you not! His arrogance prevented him (from obeying),” He said (the narrator), “He was not able to raise it to his mouth (ever again).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Nawawi comments:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>As for the opinion of Al-Qadhi Iyadh may Allah be pleased with him that the statement “his arrogance prevented him” is evidence that he was a hypocrite, is incorrect. Arrogance and going against an order does not necessitate hypocrisy, but it is a sin if he was required to obey. This Hadith is also evidence that one can invoke upon those that go against a religions ruling without an excuse.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the simple fact that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) invoked Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to prevent Mu’awiyah from being full does not mean that Mu’awiyah is a kafir, but rather, that he disobeyed an order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2- External Evidences that Mu’awiyyah was a Disbeliever </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wilayat.net quote the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 65, Number 308:</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">Narrated <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/01/11/abu-huraira/" rel="external nofollow">Abu Huraira</a>: </span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim eats in one intestine (i.e. he is satisfied with a little food) while a Kafir (unbeliever) eats in seven intestines (eats much).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authors of Wilayat.net quote this along with a statement by Ibn Katheer that Mu’awiyah used to eat seven times a day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, the statement by Ibn Katheer is free of any source and Sunnis do not accept 8th century reports about a first century individual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, it is ironic that Wilayat.net have chosen to become literalists in this specific occasion, when they are always accusing Sunnis of being shallow and literal. It is obvious that the narration is to be taken metaphorically and not literally, for there is no Muslim that is taken out of the fold of Islam for eating too much, nor has anyone seen as morbidly obese person being referred to as an apostate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3- Another Argument</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They quote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Due to this Curse of Prophet (saw), Muawiyyah became very fat and he used to fart in front of every one, every where. This cursed person even didn&#8217;t left the Minbar of Prophet (saw) and he farted there too in front of people who came there to pray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They then provided a quote by Al-Zamakhshari in which he mentions the above. The narration is disconnected since it is a testimony of a sixth century scholar and is therefore rejected.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article: “The Cursed Lineage – Sahih Sunni Sanad”. The article can be found <a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/the-cursed-lineage-sahih-sunni-sanad/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA in this article share scan while claiming that they have:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">we talked about this issue before, and that can be seen here</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/cursed-lineage/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/cursed-lineage-2/</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">let us share another sahih chain for it</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">we find in masnad abu yala&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, WE find the exact chain that they have previously provided in their article entitled: “Cursed Lineage 2.” Which can be found <a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/cursed-lineage-2/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We would like to think that they have forgotten that they have provided this narration in the past. However, they have linked to it in this article. This leads us to the conclusion that they don’t know what they are posting on their site in the first place, nor are they aware of the connection between Majma’a Al-Zawa’id and Sh. Muqbil’s Al-Saheeh Al-Musnad to earlier books of Hadith, or their purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See our refutation to that article <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/03/12/response-to-cursed-lineage/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then they finally end the article by cursing banu Umayyah many times, accusing them of being a cursed lineage. TO which I have to say a few words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does he know that `Uthman ibn `Affan, the husband of TWO of <a href="http://youpuncturedtheark.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/how-many-daughters-did-prophetsaw-had/" rel="external nofollow">Rasul-Allah&#8217;s daughters</a> (Ruqayyah  and Umm Kulthoum) `Uthman is from banu Umayyah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does he know that one of Rasul-Allah&#8217;s (saw) two daughters had a son from `Uthman called `Abdullah, is he claiming that Rasul-Allah&#8217;s (saw) grandson is from the cursed lineage?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does he know that Rasul-Allah (saw) himself married Umm Habibah Ramlah bint abu Sufiyan, a mother of believers was from banu Umayyah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does he know that Zaynab, Rasul-Allah&#8217;s (saw) other daughter married abu al-`Aas bin al-Rabi`, whose grandfather is `Abd-Shams father of banu Umayyah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does he know that `Ali ibn abi Talib married the daughter of abu al-`Aas who was called Umamah, and she was the daughter of Zaynab bint Rasul-Allah (saw)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And there&#8217;s a lot more where that came from but this is more than enough to answer the accusation of &#8220;cursed lineage&#8221;.</p>
