<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sunnis Version of the Martyrdom of Al-Hussain</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a translation of Husain bin Abdulrahman’s retelling of the events of Karbala, from the story of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/" rel="external nofollow">Muslim bin Aqeel</a> in Kufa to the very martyrdom of Al-Hussain in Karbala. The narration can be found in Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1028 through two chains provided by Al-Tabari. Al-Tabari’s first chain is weak due to the weakness of the narrator known as Abu Rabi’a, however, the second chain that he uses is authentic. Both chains lead up to one narration by Husain bin Abdulrahman. However, the first chain has a couple of additions that cannot be accepted as authentic. These additions are the conversations between Ibn Ziyad and his victims and Ibn Ziyad’s calling out to the knights for support. The rest of the narration is authentic and we have decided to include it with the additions to provide a better flow for the narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Death of Hani&#8217; bin Urwa</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabari said: Al-Husain bin Nasr narrated to me: Abu Rabi’a narrated to us, he said: Abu Awana narrated to us, from Ḥusain bin Abd Al-Rahman, he said: We were told that Al-Ḥusain…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Al-Tabari said:) and Mohammad bin Ammar Al-Razi said: Sa’id bin Sulaiman told us: Abbad bin Awwam told us that Ḥusain said: The people of Kufa wrote to Al-Husain bin Ali: “There are a hundred thousand on your side.” He sent to them Muslim bin Aqeel, who entered Kufa, then into the house of Hani’ bin Urwa, where the people gathered to him. Ibn Ziyad was then told of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Husain bin Nasr added in his narration: He then sent for Hani’, who came. He asked: “Didn’t I respect you? Wasn’t I generous with you? Didn’t I do such and such?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “How do you pay me back for that?” He said: “I pay you back by withholding from you.” He said: “You withhold from me?!” He said: He then took a cane and beat him, then he had him tied up, then he had him killed. Word of that arrived to Muslim bin Aqeel and he moved onwards with a large group of people. Word got to Ibn Ziyad, who ordered the gates of the palace to be closed, he then called out: “Forward! O’ knights of Allah!” Nobody responded to him, though it was thought that he had many people with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Death of Muslim bin Aqeel</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ḥusain said: Hilal bin Yasaaf told me:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I met them at night at the Masjid of the Ansar. Every time they passed by a road, towards the left or the right, a group of them around thirty or forty or so, would retreat. He (Hilal) said: When they arrived by the market, at that dark night, they entered the mosque. It was said to Ibn Ziyad: “By Allah, we do not see nor hear many people.” He then ordered that the roof of the mosque be ripped open. It was then ripped open. He then ordered them to carry sticks with fires lit upon them. They entered and saw around fifty men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Hilal) said: He entered and climbed the pulpit and said: “Split into fours!” They obeyed and split into fours, each of them to a leader of their own little group. Then, a group came and attacked them and Muslim was hurt badly. Some of his men were killed and they were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muslim left and entered a house that was owned by one of the Kinda tribe. A man came to Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath while he was with Ibn Ziyad, he whispered to him: “Muslim is at the house of so and so.” Ibn Ziyad asked: “What did he say?” He said: “Muslim is at the house of so and so.” Ibn Ziyad said to two men: “Bring him to me.” They entered upon him while he was with a woman that had lit him a fire as he washed his wounds. They said: “The governor calls upon you.” He said: “I want a promise (of safety).” They said: “We don’t have that authority.” He then left with them until they reached (Ibn Ziyad), where he was tied up. He then said: “Tell me something, dead man…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Husain added in his narration: “You son of a so and so! You have come to strip away my power?!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was then put to death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Hussain is Surrounded</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabari narrated using his previous chain from Husain: Hilal bin Yasaaf told me:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ziyad ordered to not let anyone in or out of the roads between Waqisa to the path of Al-Sham to the path of Basra. Al-Ḥusain came by without noticing until he saw a group of Bedouins. He asked and they replied: “We have no idea except that we cannot enter or exist.” He (Hilal) said: He then headed towards Al-Sham, towards Yazeed. The horses obstructed him at Karbala. He beseeched them by Allah and Islam. He (Hilal) said: ‘Umar bin Sa’ad, Shimr bin Thi Al-Jawshan and Husain bin Numair were sent to him, and Al-Ḥusain beseeched them by Allah and Islam to allow him to go to the Commander of the Believers and to put his hand onto his. They said: “No, Ibn Ziyad gets to decide what to do with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amongst them, upon a horse, was Al-Ḥurr bin Yazeed Al-Ḥanthali Al-Nahshali. When he heard them say this to Al-Ḥusain he said: “Don’t you accept from these men what they propose?! If the Turks and the Daylam requested this, it would have been impermissible to reject them!” They would not step down without the decision of Ibn Ziyad. Al-Hurr then turned his horse and headed towards Al-Ḥusain and his companions. They thought he was going to attack them. When he arrived close, he flipped over his shield, saluted them, then blasted towards the men of Ibn Ziyad and attacked them. He killed two of them, and was then killed, may Allah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Battle</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabari reported, using the previous chain to Husain: Sa’ad bin ‘Ubaida narrated to me:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some elderly men from the people of Kufa were upon a hill crying. They were saying: “O’ Allah, grant victory (to Al-Husain).” I (Sa’ad) said: “O’ enemies of Allah! Why don’t you come down and support him?!” He (Sa’ad) said: Al-Husain approached to speak to a messenger of Ibn Ziyad. He said: I saw him wearing a black cloak. He then spoke and then left. Then, a man from Bani Tameem, Amr Al-Tuhawi, struck him with an arrow. I saw that arrow stuck between his shoulders on his cloak. They continued to reject him and he left back to his men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I saw them and they were around a hundred men, from the children of ‘Ali bin Abi Talib were five, and from Bani Hashim were sixteen, one from Bani Sulaim, an ally, and a man from Bani Kinana, an ally, and Ibn Omar bin Ziyad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabari narrated using his previous chain from Al-Husain, he said: Sa’ad bin Ubaida told me:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were stationed within the water with Omar bin Sa’ad when a man whispered to him and said: “Ibn Ziyad sent Juwayria bin Badr Al-Tamimi and ordered him to kill you if you do not fight those men.” He (Sa’ad) said: He then got onto his horse, called for his gear, wore it, and then strode onwards with his men to battle. The head of Al-Husain was brought to Ibn Ziyad and placed between his hands. He then tapped it with his cane and said: “O’ Abu ‘Abdullah, you have grown some grey hairs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Sa’ad) said: His women, daughters, and family were brought in, and the best thing that he (Ibn Ziyad) did was that he isolated them, and provided them with an amount (of money) and some clothing. He said: Then two of the younger sons of Abdullah bin Ja’afar, or the son of the son of Ja’afar, came towards a man from Tay’, they came towards him and he killed them, and then he brought their heads to be placed in front of Ibn Ziyad. He (Sa’ad) said: He (Ibn Ziyad) considered killing him (for this action), but ultimately ordered his house to be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Al-Hussain was Martyred</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the very manner of which Al-Hussain was killed, we find an acceptable report that can be found in Mu’jam Al-Tabarani 2/704.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabarani narrated: Mohammad bin Uthman bin Abi Shayba told us: Furat bin Mahboob told us: Abu Bakr bin Ayyash told us: Aslam Al-Manqari told me: I entered upon Al-Hajjaj, then Sinan bin Anas, the killer of Al-Ḥusain, entered. He was an elderly dark man, with henna, a long nose, and discoloration on his face. He stood towards Al-Hajjaj and Al-Hajjaj looked at him. He said: “Are you the killer of Al-Husain?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “How did you do it?” He said: “I rammed my spear into him and cut him up with my sword.” Al-Ḥajjaj said: “You will not be united with him in one abode (in the afterlife).”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This narration is the most authentic narration about how Al-Ḥusain was killed, and it has a decent chain. Al-Furat bin Mahboob is an acceptable narrator. Refer to Ilal Al-Daraqutni 1/218. As for Moḥammad bin Uthman bin Abi Shayba, there seems to be a difference of opinion as to whether he should be accepted or not as a reliable narrator, though it seems that he is acceptable as Al-Mu’allimi has concluded in his Tankil 1/460-462 after he proved that most of the criticisms against him come from the path of Ibn ‘Uqda, who is accused of fabricating hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">We would like to point out that even though the amount of information regarding the events of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a> are not too detailed in Sunni sources, we can at least rest assured that the material is indeed authentic, as opposed to the material found in Shia sources, which is based upon disconnected reports that anyone can make up as well as anonymous narrators.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">History of Karbala &#8211; A Study of Sources</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our previous articles about certain events in the history of Karbala, we have taken a look at the major exaggerations that revolve around Muslim bin Aqeel, Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas, and Ali Al-Akbar. In this article, we will be taking a look at the source of exaggerations that played a role in shaping of the Shia view of the history of Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to give the readers a clear view of what has led to these developments in the history of Karbala, we have split this article as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Abu Mikhnaf and his Role in Shaping the History of Karbala</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Manuscripts of Maqtal Al-Hussain that have been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Published Editions of Maqtal Al-Hussain that has been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Introduction about the book Maqtal Al-Hussain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Al-Jbouri’s Refutation to those that accept the commonly Distributed Book</strong></li>
<li><strong>Abbas Al-Qummi View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf</strong></li>
<li><strong>Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi’s View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Mikhnaf and his Role in Shaping the History of Karbala</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may come as a surprise to most Shias that the vast majority of their views comes through what revolves around one man. Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya, was a second century historian that documented the history of Karbala. However, his book did not survive and Shias had to rely on another book for the history of Karbala. Strangely, that other book is also attributed to Abu Mikhnaf, and his words are used by all modern lecturers and authors that have wrote about the history of Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give an idea to the readers as to how much this erroneous version has been circulated, we provided quotes from an expert on the topic of Karbala, the Shia historian Kamil Al-Jbouri:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Manuscripts of Maqtal Al-Hussain that have been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kamil Al-Jbouri states (p. 32-34):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maqtal Al-Hussain has many manuscripts that can be found in the storage facilities of the world. They can be found under titles like Maqtal Al-Hussain, or Akhbar Maqtal Al-Hussain, or Masra’ Al-Hussain, and similar titles. We shall name some of these for the sake of providing examples, not for the sake of naming all of the available manuscripts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- A copy that was written in the year 988 Ah, which can be found in Petersburg under the number #1838, in 82 folios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Another copy which was written in the year 995 AH, in the Asian Museum in Berlin, in 111 folios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Another copy can be found from the 10th century AH / 16<sup>th</sup> century AD, though it is incomplete at the beginning and end, and can be found at Dar Al-Aathaar for manuscripts in Baghdad under the number #25768. It is 20.5&#215;12 in size and contains 11 lines per page. It is in 386 folios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Another copy was written in the year 1009 AH and can also be found in the Asian Museum in Berlin. It is registered under #9036 and can be found in 19 folios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Another copy is entitled “The History of the Maqtal of Abi Abdillah Al-Hussain – peace be onto him &#8211; ,” and it ends with the following: This is what has arrived us from the martyrdom of Al-Hussain. We have completed this on the twelfth of Thi Al-Q’ida. It was written by Ali bin Khalifa Al-Muqri, may Allah forgive them both. Amen.” It dates to the 11<sup>th</sup> century AH / 17<sup>th</sup> century AD, and can be found in a Russian library under 604 B.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Another copy was written in the year 1149 AH. It is stored at the Tehran University under #684 and is in 254 folios.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction about the book Maqtal Al-Hussain</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kamil Al-Jbouri (p. 30-32) of his edition of Maqtal Al-Hussain states:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0002-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3443 external nofollow"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3443 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg" alt="scan0002" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The most famous person who has narrated what occurred at Al-Taff, as well as the scenes of great struggles and sacrifices, is Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya bin Sa’eed Al-Azdi Al-Kufi. He passed away in the year 157 AH. Most of the books of biographies and indexes have mentioned his book “Maqtal Al-Hussain”. Al-Najashi mentioned it in his book of biographies p. 245. Ibn Al-Nadeem mentioned it in his Fihrist p. 136. Al-Tusi mentioned it in his Fihrist p. 155. Yaqoot Al-Hamawi mentioned it in his Mu’jam Al-Udaba’ 17/41. Ibn Shakir mentioned it in his Fawat Al-Wafiyaat 3/225.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aforementioned book, Maqtal Al-Hussain – peace be onto him &#8211; , which was quoted by and relied upon by the great scholars of old is now lost. This is the case with the rest of his (Abu Mikhnaf’s) books. All that is left are fragments that can be found here and there in books of history and narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for that which we find in front of us that has been attributed to him, then it is not by him. Not only that, but it is not by any of the relied upon historians. For it contains many narrations that Abu Mikhnaf had [no] idea about and are falsely attributed to the man. There are many that have lied upon him, which is evidence of his greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evidences of this falsehood are that the language used is not the language of his times and it contains grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we were to assume that the origin of this narration is by Abi Mikhnaf, then the one that we find, which has been attributed to him, has gone through late revisions. These revisions of the text, with time led to more revisions, until the text became irrelevant to the author’s original. Though, some truth in it, and in some areas texts that have not changed, and this is the view of Wustenfeld when he studied the two texts which were popular at that time “Maqtal Al-Hussain” and “Al-Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what has been documented by Al-Tabari about Maqtal Al-Hussain – peace be onto him &#8211; , in which he quotes from Abu Mikhnaf, and that what we find in this attributed book, we find that there is a similarity in both, especially in historical matters.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Jbouri’s Refutation to those that accept the commonly Distributed Book</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He states (p. 35-36):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that Abu Mikhnaf has another book (other than the one that was mentioned above), which includes chains of narrators and is continuous in format. However, there were those that removed the chains of narrators to make it a lighter tale, one without chains. It had to have been different from the language that we find in this (commonly distributed) book. Then, the hands of tampering and copyist errors for a hold of it and gave us what we find today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a serious attempt, I have gathered the narrations of Abi Mikhnaf that can be found in the early historical works and reorganized them, to be as closer to Abu Mikhnaf’s original work than what we find today. I have included titles under brackets like these [ ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have also relied on Tareekh Al-Tabari as my main foundation and added onto it what I found in other works to fill in the gaps, or a narration that has come with some variance, or an addition, which were attributed to him (Abu Mikhnaf).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>In order to provide readers with additional proof that the commonly distributed book does not belong to Abu Mikhnaf, we have provided the expert opinions of Abbas Al-Qummi and Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi below.</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abbas Al-Qummi View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said in his book on the history of Karbala “Nafs Al-Mahmoom” p.11 while listing his sources for his book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/?attachment_id=3463" rel="attachment wp-att-3463 external nofollow"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3463 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0001-1-150x150.jpg" alt="history of karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0001-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0001-1-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0001-1-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0001-1-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>And (I quoted) from the Maqtal of Al-Kalbi through Tathkirat Al-Sibt and Tareekh Al-Tabari. <strong>And (I quoted) from Maqtal Abi Mikhnaf from Al-Tabari. </strong>I would also refer to Al-Sayyid Ibn Tawus (may Allah have mercy on him) by Al-Sayyid. I would refer to Ibn Al-Atheer Al-Jazari as Al-Jazari. I would refer to Mohammad bin Jareer Al-Tabari as Al-Tabari. I would refer to Abu Mikhnaf as Al-Azdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I refer to the last person in that way, without using his (known) nickname for a reason. I did this so that mind would not assume that it is what has been published within the tenth volume of Bihar Al-Anwar. It has become clear to me that this is not the book of the known Abi Mikhnaf. Abu Mikhnaf is Lut bin Yahya bin Sa’eed bin Mikhnaf Al-Azdi Al-Ghamdi. He was a shaikh and a leader from amongt those of historical knowledge in Kufa. His narrations are relied upon and he narrates from Ja’afar bin Mohamamd Al-Sadiq – salutations be upon him &#8211; . His father was a companion of the Commander of the Believers, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain – peace be onto them &#8211; . Abu Mikhnaf has a lot of books, one of which is Maqtal Al-Hussain, which is quoted and relied upon by the great scholars of old. Those that review Tareekh Al-Tabari will realize that what he quotes from Maqtal Al-Hussain – peace be upon him – was mostly taken from Maqtal Abi Mikhnaf. <strong>Then, if we compare this attributed copy to him and the one that was quoted by Al-Tabari and other historians, we would realize that it is not by him (Abu Mikhnaf), nor is it by any of the relied upon historians. Due to this, I do not rely on this book when the information is exclusive to it.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi’s View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Nuri said in his Al-Lu’lu’ wal Marjan p. 187:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/?attachment_id=3462" rel="attachment wp-att-3462 external nofollow"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3462 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0002-150x150.jpg" alt="scanz0002" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanz0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya is one of the great hadithists and relied upon historians. His book “Maqtal Al-Hussain” is of the most reliable works due to the reliance of our great scholars from it along with his other works. Sadly, the original and correct version of the work does not exist. <strong>What we have is a version that has been attributed to him and it includes rejected views that go against the foundations of the school, which were added in by enemies or those that are ignorant, for some false goals. Due to this, Maqtal Al-Hussain is a book that is not reliable </strong>when it contains exclusive information that cannot be trusted, which is why we do not accept the story that Ahl Al-Bayt went to Karbala on the fortieth day, even though a similar statement can be found in Al-Lahoof.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain, that Shias have been listening to and reading, is a falsely attributed version. The common Shia view of the history of Karbala has been distorted due to this. The correct version of Maqtal Al-Hussain can be found in earlier works like that of Al-Tabari and early historians.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Ali Al-Akbar at Karbala</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following article examines Ali Al-Akbar, his biography, and his involvement at Karbala by comparing the Shia narrations and their development through time. Like our previous articles on Muslim bin Aqeel and Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas, we are have decided to provide the reader with the two versions of Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the sake of clarity, we have split the article into the following sections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<h3><strong>Who is Ali Al-Akbar?</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Karbala Sources for this Study</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Ali Al-Akbar at Karbala by Abi Mikhnaf (Original Version)</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Ali Al-Akbar at Karbala by Abi Mikhnaf (“Improved” Version)</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>A Brief Analysis and Conclusion</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who is Ali Al-Akbar?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is Ali bin Al-Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib. His mother is Layla the daughter of Abi Murra bin Urwa bin Mas’oud Al-Thaqafi. Her mother is Maymoona bint <strong>Abi Sufyan bin Harb bin Umayyah</strong>. (Refer to <strong>Zaidi </strong>source Maqatil Al-Talibiyeen).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, Ali Al-Akbar is the product of a marriage between Al-Hussain and the grand-daughter of Abi Sufyan. We can also come to the conclusion that this marriage occurred before the death of Uthman since Ali Al-Akbar was born before Ali Al-Asghar, who was born during the last years of the caliphate of Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This establishes that Bani Hashim and Bani Umayyah were initially on good terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ali is known as Ali Al-Akbar (the elder) because Al-Hussain had two sons named Ali. Ali Al-Asghar (the younger) is also known as Zain Al-Abideen, the fourth of the Twelve Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Sa’ad states in the biography of Ali Al-Asghar that Ali Al-Akbar passed away without having any children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Karbala Sources for this Study</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the previous articles about <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/" rel="external nofollow">Muslim bin Aqeel</a> and <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/21/abu-fadl-al-abbas-quest-for-water-at-karbala/" rel="external nofollow">Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas</a>, this article will be comparing both editions of Abi Mikhnaf’s Maqtal Al-Hussain, the most popular and oft-quoted book about the martyrdom of Al-Hussain and the tragedy at <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0002-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3443 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3443 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg" alt="ali al-akbar" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The edition that was relied upon was the Dar Al-Mahajjah Al-Baidha’ edition, which was edited and revised by Kamil Salman Al-Jburi. This edition was published in the year 2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This previous work will be put beside the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya, which was published by Mu’asasat Al-A’alami, one of the biggest Shia publishing houses. This edition was published in the year 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though it may seem as though we are studying the same book, it will become very clear soon enough that the work of Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya has been tampered with greatly. Kamil Al-Jburi has made this very clear in his introduction, in which he describes the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain to be inaccurately attributed to Lut bin Yahya. He does admit that there are many similarities as we will soon see below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3442 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3442 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Kamil Al-Jburi mentions that the original Maqtal Al-Hussain was preserved and quoted often by Al-Tabari, while the current version that has become widespread can be found in manuscript form in the Petersburg Library and only dates to the tenth century, which is pretty late compared to the former book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that we did not provide these narrations to give access to an authentic report of the martyrdom of Ali Al-Akbar, since none can be found. However, this article was written in order to show the readers the manipulations that have occurred in the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/24/history-karbala-study-sources/" rel="external nofollow">history of Karbala</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ali Al-Akbar at Karbala by Abi Mikhnaf (Original Version)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya (p. 138) quoting Zuhair bin Abdulrahman said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first person that was killed from the children of Abi Talib on that day was Ali Al-Akbar bin Al-Hussain bin Ali, and his mother is Layla bint Abi Murra bin Urwa bin Mas’ud Al-Thaqafi. That occurred when he was striving against the people while reciting:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am Ali bin Al-Hussain bin Ali – We, by the Lord of the Ka’aba, closer to the Prophet – By Allah, those that attribute themselves to fathers falsely shall not judge us</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then repeated that until Murra bin Munqith bin Al-Nu’man Al-Abdi Al-Laythi saw him. Then he said: Upon me are the sins of all the Arabs if I let him get away with that without making his father cry over his grave!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Ali Al-Akbar) strived against the people with his sword until Murra bin Munqith came in front of him. He (Murra) then stabbed him and he (Ali Al-Akbar) fell. The men then surrounded him and stabbed him with their swords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf (p. 139) quotes Abdulrahman bin Yazeed bin Jabir, who quotes Humaid bin Muslim, who provides a narration that is identical to the previous one with a little addition in the poetry. It also states that Murra struck Ali Al-Akbar with a spear and not a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ali Al-Akbar at Karbala by Abi Mikhnaf (“Improved” Version)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration allegedly attributes the following to Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya (p. 155):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ali (Al-Akbar) bin Al-Hussain then appear next and said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am Ali bin Al-Hussain bin Ali &#8211; We, by the Lord of the Ka’aba, closer to the Prophet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ll strike you with my sword until it gets sharper – With the attack of a young Hashimi Alawi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will pierce you with my spear through the shiny dust</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked the heretics and kept on attacking them until he killed a hundred and eighty knights. Then, an accursed man came out of hiding and struck him on his head, which caused him to fall to the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then sat up and started to call out: O’ father, salutations to you! This is my grandfather the Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him and his progeny &#8211; , my father Ali – peace be onto him – , and my grandmother Fatima, and they say: Make haste! Make haste! They miss you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Brief Analysis and Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, the “improved” version has greatly dramatized the events of that day as well as the actions of Ali Al-Akbar. The most obvious addition to the original is that Ali Al-Akbar obliterates a hundred and eighty knights. The original  report does not mention that he had any successes in killing any of his foes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another one of the main additions to the “improved” version is that Ali Al-Akbar sees his father in a vision. He also sees his grandfather and grandmother briefly before his death. The vision cannot be found in the original version of the events. To get audiences more emotionally attached to the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">tragedy at Karbala</a>, this development was added.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Abu Fadl Al-Abbas’ Quest for Water at Karbala</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we decided to provide readers with the Shia narratives of Abu Fadl Al-Abbas’ Quest for water at Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have broken down the article as follows for the sake of clarity:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Karbala Sources for this Study</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0002-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3443 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3443 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg" alt="abu fadl al-abbas" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Like our previous article on <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/" rel="external nofollow">Muslim bin Aqeel</a>, we chose to rely upon the most authentic rendition of the martyrdom of Al-Hussain, which is known as Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya. The edition that was relied upon was the Dar Al-Mahajjah Al-Baidha’ edition, which was edited and revised by Kamil Salman Al-Jburi. This edition was published in the year 2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This previous work will be put beside the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya, which was published by Mu’asasat Al-A’alami, one of the biggest Shia publishing houses. This edition was published in the year 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3442 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3442 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Even though it may seem as though we are studying the same book, it will become very clear soon enough that the work of Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya has been tampered with greatly. Kamil Al-Jburi has made this very clear in his introduction, in which he describes the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain to be inaccurately attributed to Lut bin Yahya. He does admit that there are many similarities as we will soon see below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kamil Al-Jburi mentions that the original Maqtal Al-Hussain was preserved and quoted often by Al-Tabari, while the current version that has become widespread can be found in manuscript form in the Petersburg Library and only dates to the tenth century, which is pretty late compared to the former book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to the authenticity of the report as per Shia standards, we can safely say that neither of the reports is authentic. The “improved” version cannot even be attributed to Abu Mikhnaf himself, while the original narration is the narration of Abi Mikhnaf from Sulayman bin Abi Rashid from Humaid bin Muslim. This narration is graded as weak in the eyes of Shias due to the anonymity of Sulayman. Refer to our article on Shia <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/24/history-karbala-study-sources/" rel="external nofollow">sources of Karbala</a> for more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of the article is not to provide Shia readers with the authentic version of events, but rather, to show Shia readers how the work of Abu Mikhnaf was manipulated over time and greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have chosen to start off by providing readers with the commonly known “improved” version of Abu Mikhnaf’s narration before providing them with the original Abu Mikhnaf report.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Fadl Al-Abbas at Karbala (“Improved” Version)</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf said (p. 106-p.111) :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the thirst became too much for Al-Hussain and his companions to handle, Al-Hussain (as) said to his brother Al-Abbas: O’ brother, bring your family and dig a well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They started to dig, but did not find any water. Al-Hussain (as) then said to Al-Abbas (as): O’ brother, head to the Euphrates and bring us some water. Al-Abbas responded: I hear you and obey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Abbas (as) marched alongside his men on his right and left until they arrived at the Euphrates. The companions of Ibn Ziyad (la) saw him and asked: Who are you? They said: We are the companions of Al-Hussain (as). They said: What do you want? They replied: We have been overwhelmed by our thirst and the hardest thing for us is to see Al-Hussain (as) thirsty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they heard this, they attacked them in one fell swoop, and Al-Abbas (as) and his companions started to attack them and killed some of their men. He then recited (poetry):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I fight them with a guided head – Protecting the grandson of the Prophet Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I strike them with a sword – Until they back away from fighting my master</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am Al-Abbas the befriended – The son of Ali the one who has received satisfaction and aid</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked them and caused them to split to the right and the left. He killed some of their men, then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do not fear death if it comes close – Until I am buried after meeting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I protect with my soul the soul of the purified – I am patient and thankful for that meeting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I strike the head and cause it to split – I am Al-Abbas who will cause a harsh meeting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He arrived at the water and came down with a pouch which he filled. He then brought his hand down to drink, but then remembered the thirst of Al-Hussain (as). He then said: By Allah I will not taste water while my master Al-Hussain is thirsty. He then let the water flow away from his hand and left with the pouch on his back. He recited:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">O’ soul after (the death of) Al-Hussain you should not last – After him you should not stay</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can Al-Hussain drink death – While you drink cold water?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I could never do this for it is not an act of my religion – nor is it an act of a true believer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then returned from the water when he got sprayed with arrows until his shield looked like a hedgehog. Al-Abras bin Shayban hit him on the right hand, and it flew off while attached to a sword. He then took up his sword with his left hand and attacked the men while chanting:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By Allah, even if you cut off my right – I will forever defend my religion</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And defend the true Imam – the grandson of the purified and trusted prophet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A true prophet that came to us with my religion – entrusted by the trusted one</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked the men again and killed some of their men. He defeated their heroes while the pouch was on his back. When Ibn Sa’ad (la) saw him, he said: Shoot the pouch, for if Al-Hussain (as) drinks it, then he will kill all of you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They then attacked Al-Abbas heavily, but he killed a hundred and eighty of their knights. Then, Abdullah bin Yazeed Al-Shaybani struck his left hand and cut it off. He then clenched onto the sword with his teeth and started to attack them. He then chanted:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">O’ soul do not fear the disbelievers – And be happy with the news of the mercy of the Almighty</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be with the Prophet, the master of the good – And with a group of the masters and the purified</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They cut off my left hand with their wickedness – so my Lord make them taste the heat of the fire</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked the men while his arms were leaking blood, and they attacked him together. He fought them heavily, and a man stuck him with a pole on his head which cut him and caused him to fall to the ground with his blood leaking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then cried: Ya Aba Abdillah! Peace be to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Al-Hussain (as) heard his voice, he cried: O’ my brother! O’ my Abbas! O’ my heart!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked the men and caused them to split away from him (Al-Abbas). He then carried him onto the back of his horse and entered his tent, put him down, and started crying heavily until everyone cried.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Fadl Al-Abbas at Karbala (Original Version)</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf (p. 143) said: Sulayman bin Abi Rashid told me: from Humaid bin Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the thirst became too extreme fro Al-Hussain to handle, he called for his brother Al-Abbas bin Ali. He then sent with him thirty men with horses and thirty footmen. He sent with him twenty pouches. They then got close to the water where Nafi’ bin Hilal Al-Jamali proceeded forward. Amr bin Al-Hajjaj asked: Who are you? He replied: Nafi’ bin Hilal. He said: Greetings my brother, what brings you here? He said: We came to drink from this water that you have blocked away from us. He replied: Drink up. He said: Nay, we shall not drink while Al-Hussain is thirsty. He replied: There is no chance that we will allow that, for we are placed here because we are to prevent you from the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When his (Nafi’s) men came closer, he said to them: Fill your pouches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The men then entered towards the water and filled up their pouches. They then left. Amr bin Al-Hajjaj and his companions then struggled with them. Al-Abbas bin Ali and Nafi’ bin Hilal Al-Jamali then attacked them and backed them off. Then, they left and told their men to leave. The men then entered upon Al-Hussain with the pouches.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Brief Analysis and Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, <strong>the narrative that surrounds what occurred to Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas bin Ali at <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a> has been twisted severely</strong>. Nowhere in the original version of the events do we find Al-Abbas taking on massive numbers of troops, nor do we find him fighting large forces in a solo suicide mission. The original Abu Mikhnaf version of the reports do not include that he was even killed at the time, but rather, that he successfully is able to return to Al-Hussain with the pouches of water. This version of events are a lot more believable than the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/26/battle-of-karbala-critical-study/" rel="external nofollow">“improved” version</a> that suggests that Al-Abbas was able to defeat a hundred and eighty knights single-handedly (since his right arm was cut off at the time).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much from the “improved” version raises red flags. Not only are the details of the battle too vivid for it to be believable, but it is simply unacceptable to believe that all this poetry was preserved. Are we to believe that his wretched and accursed enemies were memorizing his battle hymns?! Perhaps the most obvious fabrication is that he was chanting lines of poetry while clenching the sword with his teeth. How could his enemies even make out what he was saying?! Let alone bother to document the poetry! Let us not forget that he attacked his foes with the sword between his teeth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important for readers to be aware that the fabrications about Abu Fadl Al-Abbas do not end here. We have only provided a sample of the fabrications by providing two sources that are attributed to Abu Mikhnaf, only to give readers a little taste of how such falsehood develops. In recent times, much taller tales have been told about Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas. Murtadha Al-Mutahari, in 1969, in a group of lectures while speaking about such fabrications said, “Similar things are said concerning Hadrat Abu al-Fadl, that he killed twenty-five thousand men. I calculated that if one man were killed per second, it would require six days and fifty and odd hours to kill that many.” Refer to the <a href="https://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/vol13-no3/ashura-misrepresentations-distortions-part-1-mutahhari" rel="external nofollow">al-islam.org article</a> for more on this topic by Al-Mutahari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, we can only wish the best for the Shias that have been misguided into believing such tales. Truly, Abu Fadl Al-Abbas did not need such alterations to his history in order for him to be loved and respected. May Allah guide us all.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Muslim bin Aqeel: A Case Study of Fabrication in the Karbala Narrative</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we will take a closer look at the fabrications and exaggerations that have occurred in the main Shia texts that revolve around the martyrdom of Muslim bin Aqeel at the hands of Ubaidullah bin Ziyad. The article takes a look at the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/26/battle-of-karbala-critical-study/" rel="external nofollow">battle</a> that takes place after the failed revolution in Kufa, at the house of the old woman, right before Muslim bin Aqeel is detained and finally killed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have broken down the article as follows for the sake of clarity:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Karbala Sources for this Study</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0002-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3443 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3443 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg" alt="muslim bin aqeel" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>For this study, we chose to rely upon the most authentic rendition of the martyrdom of Al-Hussain, which is known as Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya. The edition that was relied upon was the Dar Al-Mahajjah Al-Baidha’ edition, which was edited and revised by Kamil Salman Al-Jburi. This edition was published in the year 2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This previous work will be put beside the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya, which was published by Mu’asasat Al-A’alami, one of the biggest Shia publishing houses. This edition was published in the year 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though it may seem as though we are studying the same book, it will become very clear soon enough that the work of Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya has been tampered with greatly. Kamil Al-Jburi has made this very clear in his introduction, in which he describes the commonly distributed version of Maqtal Al-Hussain to be inaccurately attributed to Lut bin Yahya. He does admit that there are many similarities as we will soon see below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/scan0001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3442 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3442 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scan0001-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Kamil Al-Jburi mentions that the original Maqtal Al-Hussain was preserved and quoted often by Al-Tabari, while the current version that has become widespread can be found in manuscript form in the Petersburg Library and only dates to the tenth century, which is pretty late compared to the former book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to the authenticity of the report as per Shia standards, we can safely say that neither of the reports is authentic. The <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">“improved” version</a> cannot even be attributed to Abu Mikhnaf himself, while the original narration is the narration of Abi Mikhnaf from Qudama bin Sa’eed bin Za’ida. This narration is weak because of an anonymous narrator according to Shias. Refer to our article on Shia sources and <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/24/history-karbala-study-sources/" rel="external nofollow">history of Karbala</a> for more. However, the purpose of the article is not to provide the reader with an authentic Shia version, but rather, to display the efforts of fabricators in order to exaggerate a narrative in order to appeal to Shia laymen.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim bin Aqeel’s Battle in the Original Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a translation of the original Maqtal Al-Hussain, edited and revised by Kamil Al-Jburi (p. 72-73):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Ibn Ash’ath got up to bring Ibn Aqeel to him (Ubaidullah bin Ziyad), he called for Amr bin Huraith, who was in the Masjid, representing him in front of the people. He wrote: Send with Ibn Ash’ath sixty or seventy men from the tribe of Qais. He did not want to send people from his own tribe, since he knew that they would not want to face Ibn Aqeel. So he sent with him Amr bin Ubaidullah bin Abbas Al-Sulami with sixty or seventy people from the tribe of Qais. When they reached the house that Ibn Aqeel was in, he (Muslim) hear the steps of the horses and the sounds of the men, so he came out with his sword as they broke in, so he attacked them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both him and Bukair bin Humran Al-Ahmari exchanged strikes, and Bukair struck the mouth of Muslim, cutting off his upper lip, and piercing his lower lip, exposing his two frontal teeth. Muslim then stuck him heavily, then again, between his neck and shoulder, which almost cut through him. When this was seen, they (the men) climbed the house and started tossing stones at him, and set some canes on fire, tossing them at him. When he saw that, he left the house with his sword, onto the street, and fought them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath approached him and said: Boy, we will allow you safety, so do not cause yourself to be killed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continued to fight them and recited (some poetry):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I vowed that I will not die except a free man – Even though I have seen death as a torment</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every man shall face evil someday – And mix the cold, the hot, and the bitter</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Push back the sunlight and make it stable – For I fear being lied to or to be fooled</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath replied: You will not be lied or fooled, for these men are your cousins, and they will not kill you or harm you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By then, he (Muslim bin Aqeel) had already been hurt by the stones, and was tired from the fighting. So he put his back to the wall. Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath approached him and said: You are safe. He (Muslim bin Aqeel) replied: I am safe? He said: Yes. The people said: You are safe. They all said this except for Amr bin Ubaidullah bin Al-Abbas Al-Sulami, who said: I have nothing to do with this. He then backed away.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim bin Aqeel’s Battle in the “Improved” Maqtal Al-Hussain by Abi Mikhnaf</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is the translation of the “new and improved” version that has become common today. The edition is, as stated previously, the A’alami Edition (p. 60-65)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Ubaidullah bin Ziyad) then called for Mohammad bin Ash’ath, then provided him with five hundred knights. He said: Move onwards, with this boy, and bring me Muslim bin Aqeel (as), dead or alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They moved onwards until they reached the old woman’s house, and she heard the neighs of the horses, the slapping of their halters, and the sounds of the men, so she told Muslim. Muslim said: They are looking for me only. He then said: Bring my sword. He then prepared himself, armored up, and faced the men while waving his sword. The old woman said: Oh master, are you preparing yourself for death?! He replied: Sure, there is no escape from death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, he moved towards the door and ripped it off, and it was large. He faced them and fought them hard, killing a hundred and eighty knights. The rest were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Ibn Al-Ash’ath saw the bravery of Muslim (as), he sent to Ibn Ziyad (la) a letter saying: Supply me with horses and men. He sent to him five-hundred knights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muslim bin Aqeel then came out and killed a lot of them, so Ibn Al-Ash’ath sent to Ibn Ziyad (la) a letter saying: Supply me with horses and men. Ibn Ziyad then wrote to him: May your mother cry upon you and may your people destroy you, a single man kills this many of you?! What if I sent you to someone who was more powerful – meaning Al-Hussain (as) &#8211; ?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath then wrote: Do you think that you have sent me to a Kufan vendor or a random man from Al-Heera? You have sent me to a hero, a lion, and a sword of the Messenger of Allah (saw).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Ziyad then sent five-hundred knights, and said: Promise him safety, or else he will kill you all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They cried onto him: Oh Muslim bin Aqeel, we promise you safety. He said: I will not give you any safety, O’ enemies of Allah and His messenger! He then fought with them harshly, and he exchanged two strikes with Bakr bin Humran. Muslim then struck him on the head and killed him. Then, he struck another person and killed him. They then, gathered onto the roofs, tossing flames at him, he then shouted:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I vowed that I will not die except a free man – Even though I have seen death as a torment</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For I fear being lied to or to be fooled – Push back the sunlight and make it stable</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will attack you and fear no punishment – The actions of a young man that will not flee</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every betrayer shall be betrayed – and will be punished in a scorching hell</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then attacked the men and fought them heavily, and killed a lot of them. Then, an accursed person came and said: I will lay a trap that he will not be able to escape from. They asked: How? He said: We will dig a well on the path and cover it, then attack him, then retreat, and I do not think that he will escape it. So, they did this while Muslim was unaware. They attacked him, then he attacked them, then they retreated, and he fell into a well. They gathered around the well and brought him out. Then Ibn Ash’ath (la) struck him on the face through his nose and mouth, breaking his frontal teeth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Brief Analysis</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, there are some extreme differences between the two renditions of the events. Even though both narrations are attributed to Abu Mikhnaf, we find a version that is much more reasonable in the original version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both versions state that Muslim bin Aqeel is at the house of an old woman during the time. Both mention that Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath is sent with men in order to capture him. Both narrations include attempts by his opponents to promise him safety. The outcome of him being secured and brought to Ubaidullah in Ziyad is the same, even though there are some major differences that are too apparent to ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, the original version states that Muslim bin Aqeel is tricked into believing that he will be given safety. The “improved” version shows a defiant Muslim bin Aqeel that would not accept the peace offering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other differences include the identity of the person that strikes his lip, as well as other minor details of his fight with Bakr/Bukair bin Humran, and some slight differences in the poetry that is attributed to Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most obvious alteration in the narration is that the original version states that Muslim bin Aqeel was fighting off sixty to seventy men. The narration does not mention how many people Muslim killed. In the “improved” version, Muslim faces five-hundred knights in the first round of fighting, and kills a hundred and eighty knights. He then faces another five hundred knights and defeats them. Then, he faces another five hundred, and defeats them, killing large amounts of men, but the narration does not state how many. <strong>In total, Muslim bin Aqeel defeats a thousand and five hundred knights, and kills <u>at least a hundred and eighty</u>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The language and tone of the “improved” version is a lot more emotional as well.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim bin Aqeel’s Battle in the Authentic Sunni Tradition</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those curious, we have included the authentic Sunni version of the above events. An authentic version will provide the reader with the Sunni alternative. The narration can be found in Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1028. It does not include any of the exaggerations found in either of the two versions above:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tabari, from Mohammad bin Ammar Al-Razi, from Sa’eed bin Sulayman, from Abbad bin Awwam, from Husain bin Abdulrahman said: Hilal bin Yasaf told me: I met them at night at the Masjid of the Ansar. Every time they passed by a road, towards the left or the right, a group of them, around thirty or forty or so, would retreat. He (Hilal) said: When they arrived by the market, at that dark night, they entered the mosque. It was said to Ibn Ziyad: By Allah, we do not see nor hear many people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He then ordered that the roof of the mosque be ripped open. It was then ripped open. He then ordered them to carry sticks with fires lit upon them. They entered and saw around fifty men. He (Hilal) said: He entered and climbed the pulpit and said: “Split into fours!” They obeyed and split into fours, each of them to a leader of their own little group. Then, a group came and attacked them and Muslim was hurt badly. Some of his men were killed and they were defeated. Muslim left and entered a house that was owned by someone from the Kinda tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man came to Mohammad bin Al-Ash’ath while he was with Ibn Ziyad. He whispered to him: Muslim is at the house of so and so. Ibn Ziyad asked: What did he say? He said: Muslim is at the house of so and so. Ibn Ziyad said to two men: Bring him to me. They entered upon him while he was with a woman that had lit him a fire as he washed his wounds. They said: The governor calls upon you. He said: I want a promise (of safety). They said: We don’t have that authority.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We often hear by Shias that Sunni scholars do not teach laymen about the history of Al-Hussain. Shias complain that his history and his death at <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a> are hidden away. However, we can clearly see above that the common rendition of the events that surround the martyrdom of Muslim bin Aqeel has been twisted in such a way that Shias should not be able to make such claims with a straight face. This is because Shia scholars are not teaching Shias the real version of the events. Not only that, but they are filling the hearts of the youth with the most exaggerated version. This is done in order to induce tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, we invite Shias to open their hearts to the more reasonable Sunni version of the events. <strong>The</strong> <strong>death of Muslim bin Aqeel was a tragedy, but it was not a tall tale.</strong> This view is more reasonable to the objective mind.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Karbala &#8211; the Facts and the Fairy-tales</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The martyrdom of Al-Hussain at Karbala has truly become a tale of epic proportions. It would not be an outrageous claim if one were to suggest that across the globe there is a continuous <em>matam </em>(seasonal mourning processions) event in which the story of Al-Hussain at Karbala is being told. The tragedy of Al-Hussain is a tragedy without a doubt, though, for the Shia, it is a tragedy for all the wrong reasons, for there is little doubt that Shias have no idea of what truly transpired at Karbala. Instead, they are fed with fairy-tales and fabrications that know no end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We request our Sunni readers to ask your Shia acquaintance to share with you the story of Karbala. There is little doubt that the zealous Shia will take this opportunity to share the tales that he has heard. Then, we request that you pop the most awkward question possible: Would you mind providing a source for this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are certain that the Shia will have nothing more to say other than: 1) this is what we were told at the <em>matam</em>, 2) everyone knows this, or 3) my mom told me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia has not yet realized the kind of predicament that he is in. This is because of their blind faith in those three “sources”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, most Shias have never read through a book about the martyrdom of Al-Hussain. Yes, they do have one lying on their shelf, but they have never attempted to read it. Instead, they’d rather “listen” to the events of Karbala at their gatherings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why would this be considered a dilemma though?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">We list out answers below in short and we will expand on them as we go along:</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1- Twelver Shias have no Idea what their “Real” Sources are in Regards to Karbala</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By sources, we mean books, or narrations, or texts. Receiving these narratives from parents or other family members is not sufficient. They simply weren’t there in the year 61 AH, nor were their grand-parents for that matter. The well-read English-speaking modern Shia, will most likely have picked up one of three books. &#8220;Nafsul Mahmoom&#8221; by Abbas Al-Qummi, &#8220;Maqtal Al-Hussain&#8221; by Al-Muqarram, or &#8220;A Probe into the History of Ashura&#8221; by Ibrahim Ayaati are<strong> the three most popular English books about Karbala.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, all three of these books are relatively modern, and can be considered to be contemporary works. A Probe into the History of Ashura is the weakest of the three. Originally, it was a collection of lectures about the lessons of Ashura, which was then collected as a book. Abbas Al-Qummi attempts to keep the analysis to a minimal. Al-Qummi focuses on actually providing the reader with the proper source material for what makes up the events of the battle of Karbala. Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram sticks to the middle path. Al-Muqarram provides both an analysis of events while providing a multitude of quotations from the earlier sources.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Source Material</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the source material, it is mainly based off four earlier works. They are Al-Irshaad by Al-Mufeed (413 AH), Ibn Shahrashoub’s (558 AH) Manaqib, Ibn Tawus’ (664 AH) Al-Lahoof, and Mohammad bin Abi Talib’s Tasliyat Al-Mujalis (10<sup>th</sup> century).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first two sources in the list are books that contain a lot of information about the twelve Imams, while the last two are specifically about Al-Hussain and his martyrdom in Karbala. Sadly, none of the four sources rely on chains of narrations. This is extremely problematic since the reader does not have the ability to judge which report is authentic. More importantly, none of these four men were at Karbala, nor were their parents or grandparents present. However, <em>shaikhs</em> at the <em>matam</em> today, feel obligated to preach what is found in these four books as if every single word was canon.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Solution</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the modern Shia preacher will not restrict themselves to what these four books contain without a doubt. Indeed, they will need to spice things up once in a while by providing their own exaggerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all cases, taking knowledge from sources that have been so disconnected from the reality of Karbala is hazardous. The status of Al-Hussain in the hearts of the Shia youth will allow for anything to flow in with the fabrications. This includes a corrupt ideology that has been entangled with the events of Karbala.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For further reading on this topic, be sure to check out <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/09/05/ashura-lies-and-fabrications/" rel="external nofollow">another one of our articles</a> on the topic of how Shia scholars accuse preachers at Hussainiyat of fabricating stories in order to appeal to their fanbase.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2- Statistics demonstrate Shia Manipulation of the Events of Karbala</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many ways for one to show how far Shia historians went in order to manipulate the events of Karbala to greater extremes. Below, we have included one set of statistics that display this fact. This was done when we compared the names of some of the companions of Al-Hussain and the number of those that they have killed during the battle of Karbala. To compile this little comparison, we relied on two sources: Al-Saduq’s (381 AH) Amali (p. 126-128) and Ibn Shahrashoub’s (558 AH) Manaqib (4/1006-1013). Notice that in a small time frame of two centuries, statistics have been distorted considerably over the coming centuries in favor of a more epic battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq in Al-Amali shows Al-Hurr bin Yazeed killing eighteen men (18), while Ibn Shahrashoub states that the number killed were “forty-something” (40+).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, Al-Saduq mentions that Habeeb bin Muthahir killed thirty-one men (31), while Ibn Shahrashoub mentions exactly twice as much as sixty-two (62).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Al-Saduq) mentions that Zuhair bin Al-Qayn killed nineteen men (19), while Ibn Shahrashoub adds a hundred and one more men to make the number: a hundred and twenty (120).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq mentions that Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel killed three (3), while Ibn Sharhashoub mentions that he killed ninety-eight (98)!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note, that is how disproportional things may get in a mere two hundred years. Imagine how bad has it gotten since then.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Children of Ali and Al-Hussain?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be noted that those that took part in Karbala that had names of the first three Caliphs were never given any attention. The sources mentioned earlier do refer to the participation of Abu Bakr bin Ali, Abu Bakr bin Al-Hussain, Omar bin Ali, and Uthman bin Ali, however, none of them were said to have killed anyone, with the exception of Omar bin Ali who killed one man according to one Shia narration. Perhaps it was their names that prevented the storytellers and fabricators from ascribing glorious feats to their names.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More fun facts from even earlier historians:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the early Shia historian Abu Mikhnaf (158 AH), only eighty-eight men (88) from Omar bin Sa’ad’s army were killed. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1053)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf also said that Omar bin Sa’ad’s army was four-thousand (4,000) men large. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1053)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Shahrashoub being a much later Shia author suggests that the number was thirty-five thousand (35,000) men!! (Manaqib Aal Abi Talib 4/1004)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3- One Single Twelver Shia Narration actually does have a Chain!<br />
</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the lack of a complete text that examines the events of Karbala from beginning to end, a contemporary by the name of Mohammad Jawad Al-Tabasi collected his &#8220;Maqtal Al-Husaini Al-Ma’thoor&#8221;, in which he built his book upon the traditions that have been attributed to the Imams directly. His effort was a solid one, though it was the lack of data that ultimately betrayed him, for there was only one narration in his book that provided any clear image of the events that transpired in Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From his collection, the closest thing to a direct narration of the events of Karbala can be found in Amali Al-Saduq (381 AH). The narration is nine pages long. The modern Shia <em>matam</em> preacher will be saddened by how limiting nine pages must be, but alas, this is all that Shias really have to work with, if they wanted to be loyal to the text. Objectively, nine pages is by no means “small” narration, though, it is not long enough to fill the time slots at Hussainiyat <em>matams</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately for those that do not read Arabic, we are not interested in putting in the effort to translate fabrications. Indeed, this narration is a fabrication according to the standards of Ahlul-Sunnah and Shias alike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chain goes as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq, from Mohammad bin Omar Al-Baghdaadi, from Abu Sa’eed Al-Hasan bin Uthman bin Ziyad Al-Tusturi, from Ibrahim bin Ubaidullah bin Musa bin Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq Al-Sabee’ee, from Mareesa bint Musa bin Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq, from Safiyya bint Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq, from Bahja bint Al-Harith bin Abdullah Al-Taghlabi, from Abdullah bin Mansour, from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chain Criticism</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the narrators in this chain are anonymous according to both Sunni and Shia rijali standards. Sunnis go the extra mile by accusing Al-Hasan bin Uthman of being a liar. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan where Abu Ali Al-Nisapuri and Ibn Adi both accuse him of lying. Even the Shia scholar Ni’matullah Salihi reached the same conclusion about Al-Hasan bin Uthman. (See Al-Shaheed Al-Khalid p. 346)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Textual Criticism</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the narration itself is extremely problematic for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The narration mentions that Utba bin Abi Sufyan is appointed as governor of Madinah, when in reality, Utba died in the year 44AH according to Ibn Zabr Al-Rib’ee 1/143.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain leaves Madinah and heads directly to Iraq. This contradicts the established fact that he went to Makkah where he spent months there before leaving to Iraq.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ubaidullah bin Ziyad kills Sinan bin Anas, the killer of Al-Hussain, when Sinan brings in Al-Hussain’s head. This is illogical and goes against the established fact that Sinan was alive and stayed alive until the time of Al-Hajjaj. (See Al-Tabarani’s Mu’jam 2/704)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration provided by Al-Saduq does one thing differently though. It contains exaggerations that cannot be found in earlier sources that have been provided by Sunnis. These include visions by Al-Hussain, his certain knowledge of his martyrdom, and tales about how he killed people by supplicating against them. Even though the modern Shia may reject that these are exaggerations, one needs to keep in mind that it is only because they have been used to the exaggerated narratives every time they walk into a <em>matam</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4- The Earliest “Shia” Sources</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps there are two other sources that may be interpreted to be “Shia sources”. We use that word loosely since we hold the opinion that these two have nothing to do with the Imami narrative. The first of these is a narration by Mohammad Al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam. In this narration, his student, Ammar Al-Duhani asks him to narrate to him the events of Karbala “as if he could see it.” The narration itself is not too long either and it can exclusively be found in Sunni sources. Scholars that often quote this report do so through Tareekh Al-Tabari, though it can be found elsewhere. Of course, Shias often shun this narration simply because it comes through a Sunni source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunnis shouldn’t blame Shias though, since we feel the same way about their sources. Ironically, Sunnis themselves take this narration with a grain of salt because it comes through the path of a narrator named Khaled bin Yazeed Al-Qasri, who is extremely weak in his narrations. Some Sunnis have flat out rejected this narration for the same purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other source is perhaps the most important complete early source about the events of Karbala. Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya’s rendition of Maqtal Al-Hussain has always been the skeleton of the Karbala narrative. Fabricators often would keep his narration as the base, but then add onto it. This is very clear in the actual battle of Karbala if one were to compare Abu Mikhnaf’s narration and the late sources that have been mentioned above.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3002 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3001 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s Reliability</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to the reliability of Abu Mikhnaf’s tradition, Al-Tusturi, in his Mu’jam Al-Rijal 8/620 says that “his book Maqtal Al-Hussain (as), that is narrated by Al-Tabari and Abu Al-Faraj, is the most authentic <em>maqtal</em> (retelling of the death of Al-Hussain), for he narrates these events usually through one single intermediary.” Al-Najashi, similarly, when speaking about Abu Miknaf p. 320, says, “There is an acceptance to what he narrates.” Ayatullah Al-Salihi makes a very similar statement in his Al-Shaheed Al-Khalid (p. 39), where he argues that Al-Murtadha and Al-Tusi both relied on Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s version through Al-Tabari. Al-Salihi continues to build the case for Abu Mikhnaf by saying that he was a student of Ja&#8217;afar. All in all, the man is considered reliable by their standards&#8230; but does that he mean his narration is authentic as they claim?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s Teachers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, such statements are never satisfying to researchers, which is why we took it upon ourselves to list the teachers of Abu Mikhnaf in his Maqtal Al-Hussain, in order to see if his narrations are reliable according to Shia standards:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Narrators that are weak according to Al-Jawahiri:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Abdulrahman bin Jundub – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 309.</li>
<li>Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 678.</li>
<li>Qudama bin Sa’eed – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 468.</li>
<li>Al-Harith bin Ka’ab Al-Wabili – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 124.</li>
<li>Aqaisa – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 376.</li>
<li>Isma’eel bin Abdulrahman Al-Suddi – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 67.</li>
<li>Al-Harith bin Husaira – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p 123.</li>
<li>Amr bin Murra – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 437.</li>
<li>Ata’a bin Al-Sa’ib – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 374.</li>
<li>Uqba bin Basheer – He is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri p. 375.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Narrators that cannot be found in early Shia Rijal books:</h4>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Al-Hajjaj bin Ali</li>
<li> Abu Al-Mukhariq Al-Rasibi</li>
<li> Numair bin Wa’la</li>
<li> Al-Saq’ab bin Zuhair</li>
<li> Al-Mu’ala bin Kulaib</li>
<li> Mujalid bin Sa’eed</li>
<li> Al-Hasan bin ‘Uqba</li>
<li> Yusuf bin Yazeed</li>
<li>Abu Janah Yahya bin Abi Hayya Al-Kalbi</li>
<li>Sulaiman bin Abi Rashid</li>
<li>Ja’afar bin Huthaifa Al-Ta’ee</li>
<li>Sa’eed bin Mudrik</li>
<li>Hisham bin Al-Waleed</li>
<li>Omar bin Khalid</li>
<li> Lawthan</li>
<li> Uqba bin Abi Al-Ayzar</li>
<li> Jameel bin Murthid</li>
<li> Al-Nadhr bin Salih</li>
<li> Abdullah bin Asim Al-Fa’ishi</li>
<li> Fudhail bin Khadeej</li>
<li> Ali bin Hanthala</li>
<li> Suwaid bin Hayya</li>
<li> Thabit bin Hubaira</li>
<li> Yahya bin Hani’ &#8211;</li>
<li> Al-Hussain bin Uqba Al-Muradi</li>
<li> Zuhair bin Abdulrahman</li>
<li> Amr bin Shu’aib</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Others:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Mohammad bin Qais – There are many people with this name and Abu Mikhnaf was not clear about the entity of his teacher, therefore, we cannot comment on his status and cannot accept his report.</li>
<li>Abu Ali Al-Ansari – There is not enough information about this narrator to identify him or accept his report.</li>
<li>Abu Al-Dahhak &#8211; There is not enough information about this narrator to identify him or accept his report.</li>
<li>Ja’far bin Mohammad bin Ali – <strong>6th Shia Imam</strong></li>
<li>Abu Hamza Al-Thamali – <strong>Trustworthy</strong> according to Shia.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, out of the forty-two teachers that Abu Mikhnaf has relied on, only two are reliable according to Shia standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the two narrations is by Abu Hamza Al-Thamali and it is about reactions to the death of Al-Hussain in Dimashq (Syria). Abu Mikhnaf narrates it from Abu Hamza, from Abdullah Al-Thamali, from Al-Qasim bin Bikheet. The latter two are both anonymous for they cannot be found in early Shia Rijal books.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">One Authentic Shia Narration</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That leaves us with one narration that could be considered authentic according to Shia standards. We are considerate of our choice of words too, since there are Shias scholars that may consider it weak since the path to Abu Mikhnaf is questionable. Regardless, we chose to translate in full. We have quoted it from Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1052:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3003 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-150x150.jpg" alt="Scan" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Abu Mikhnaf said: from Ja’afar bin Mohammad bin Ali:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Al-Hussain was killed, they found thirty-three stabs and thirty-four wounds. Sinan bin Anas used to forcefully approach anyone that would get near the body because he wanted to be the one that gets the head. He then did, and gave it to Khawli. Everything that was on Al-Hussain was taken. Bahr bin Ka’ab took his parts. Qais bin Al-Ash’ath took his cloak. Qais, then, became known as “The Cloak.” His sandals were taken by a Al-Aswad, a man from Bani Awd. His sword was taken by a man from Bani Nahshal bin Darim, and it reached Habeeb bin Budail at the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people came to his clothes, accessories, and camels, and they took all of it. The people came to the women, the booty, and his equipment, to the extent that a woman would fight over the clothes on her back until it was taken away from her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5- Popular Retellings of Al-Hussain’s Martyrdom Conflict with the Earliest Shia Versions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>a) Al-Hussain’s Reasons for  heading to Kufa </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one was to simply come across the events that led up to Karbala, one would have no doubt that Al-Hussain’s revolution was intercepted and quelled. His intention, as one can clearly see in the earliest reports, was to fill the land with justice and to politically reign over the nation. This also was the perfect time to do so since he had the support from the people of Kufa that he did not have when Mu&#8217;awiayh was in power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, according to the modern Shia interpretation, Al-Hussain knew that he was going to die by going to Kufa. In other words, he was sacrificing his own life for the sake of Islam. Twelvers hold this belief because it fits in with their ideology that the Imams know when they are going to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the staunchest supporters of this theory is <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram/al-husayn-s-prior-knowledge-his-martrydom" rel="external nofollow">Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram</a>. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">He made many such explicit and implicit statements in Medina, in Mecca, and on the way to Kufa, statements that you will read in this book in their entirety. They all testify that he (‘a), was fully aware of his being killed on the day with which he was familiar and in the land of Karbala’. So, can anyone doubt this fact if he reads his sermon in Mecca when he wanted to travel from there to Iraq? In that sermon, he said, “<em>I can see my limbs being cut to pieces by wild beasts in an area between al-Nawawees</em> <em>and Karbala’, so they will fill with my body empty stomachs and starved pouches;</em> there is no way to avert an event already decreed.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We beg to differ of course. There is no evidence that suggests that Al-Hussain knew of what was to come and there are too many evidences that suggest otherwise.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Response to Al-Muqarram</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are some points from the earliest version of the events of Karbala by Abu Mikhnaf:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When asked about where he wanted to go after fleeing Madinah, Abdullah bin Mutee’ asked Al-Hussain where he was heading to. Al-Hussain replied: Currently, I am going to Makkah, then I will make <em>istikhara</em> (a prayer in which one asks Allah for guidance when making a tough decisions) as to where to head off to next. He also mentions his intention of making <em>istikhara</em> to Ibn Abbas (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1012, 3/1025)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain writes a letter to the people of Kufa in which he states that he will send his cousin Muslim bin Aqeel to verify their need for him, and it is only then when he will make a move to Kufa. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1013)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muslim bin Aqeel had no idea that Al-Hussain knew that he was marching towards his doom until the last moments in his life. If Muslim held previous knowledge, he wouldn’t have requested sending a warning to Al-Hussain. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1022)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain spent four months in Makkah (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1024). He had no reason to spend all that time in Makkah if his purpose was to get killed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain justifies his leaving towards Kufa because of the letters that he received (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1025)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain asks Al-Farazdaq about the status of the people of Kufa in order to learn if he can trust them. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1028)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain heads to Kufa with women and children from his family. This is not an action that one would take if one believed that they would be massacred. His intention was to arrive in Kufa, live in Kufa, and reign over it. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1029)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>One More Piece of Evidence</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of all the above, this is the most important narration that solidifies the view that Al-Hussain had no idea what he was getting himself into:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf states: As for what was told to me by Mujalid bin Sa’eed, Al-Saq’ab bin Zuhair Al-Asadi, and others of the traditionalists, and this is the view of the community of the traditionalists, is that he (Al-Hussain) said: Choose one out of three things for me: Either I go back from whence I came, or I put my hand in the hand of Yazeed and we settle this ourselves, or you send me to a Muslim border town and I live amongst them. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1036)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This statement speaks volumes, it shows that when al-Hussein faced the army of Omar bin Sa’ad he wished to settle things peacefully and return safely with his family. It suggests that Al-Hussain was not only having second thoughts, but changed his mind about the rebellion once he realized that he was outnumbered and that he was marching towards not only his death, but the massacre of his own family.</p>
<h3><strong>b) The Actions of Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas in Karbala</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to popular retellings today, there is no character that is blown out of proportion as Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas bin Ali bin Abi Talib. The tragic story of his death during battle has captured the hearts and minds of all Shias around the world, to the extent that Al-Abbas is referred to by the extreme Shia as Bab Al-Hawa’ij (The Door to Needs). Extreme Shias, sadly, ask him for their sustenance and have turned him into a godly figure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The modern Shia, when asked about Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas will tell you that the army of Omar bin Sa’ad prevented Al-Hussain and his companions, who were dying of thirst, from drinking from a water resource nearby. Al-Abbas, headed over to gather some water and was confronted by the army of Omar bin Sa’ad. Al-Abbas bravely challenged thousands of men, killing tens, if not hundreds, if not thousands, depending on who you ask. Then, Al-Abbas’ arm was cut off during the battle. However, he continued to fight. Then, his other arm was cut off. Al-Abbas continued to head towards Al-Hussain’s camp with the container of water clenched between his teeth, but alas, the army of Omar bin Sa’ad killed him before he could make it back. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtCHMX56CjA" rel="external nofollow">This scene</a> has been translated into film and is seen as an accurate representation of the events by the modern Shia.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Original Version?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the narration of Abu Mikhnaf, the earliest Shia version, conflicts with this version completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3004 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>First of all, Al-Abbas does not go to retrieve water alone, but is accompanied by thirty riders and twenty foot-soldiers. Furthermore, there is no mention of any casualties, with the exception of one of the companions of Amr bin Al-Hajjaj, from the army of Omar bin Sa’ad. He was stabbed by Nafi’ bin Hilal. The narration ends with Al-Abbas and Nafi’ succeeding in retrieving the water. Al-Abbas never has his arms cut off, nor is he portrayed as a one-man army. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1036)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to be aware Al-Abbas is only mentioned in battle once more in the narration of Abu Mikhnaf (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1050) and there is no mention of any superhuman strength. He makes no other appearances or contributions.</p>
<h3><strong>c) Did Al-Hussain save Islam? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a question that Shias do not pose to themselves, even though it is often heard on pulpits that Al-Hussain’s rebellion saved Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The origin of this reasoning is the suggestion that Yazeed was so corrupt that his reign would lead to the complete destruction of Islam and the erasure of Shari’ah law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, such arguments cannot be supported with any evidence. Shias often attempt to provide narrations that suggest that Yazeed was a womaniser or a drunkard. However, neither sin is anywhere as severe as denying the Imamate of the Imam, let alone the usurpation of the position of the Imam. Hence, by Shia standards, Abu Bakr and Omar are infinitely worse than Yazeed, for the latter only came to power through inheritance, while Abu Bakr and Omar actively took Ali’s &#8220;divinely ordained rights&#8221;. In other words, Al-Hussain’s rise against Yazeed could not logically have anything to do with immoral behaviour by Yazeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we ask, how did Al-Hussain save the Shari’ah? Al-Hussain was not able take the reins of the nations from Yazeed, and eventually, a few years later, Yazeed died from natural causes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain’s rebellion did not cause a ripple in the ideology of the Muslims of the time, nor did it change the political situation. For the next ninety years, Bani Umayyah stayed in power. The rest of the Twelve Imams disappeared from the lime lights of early Islamic politics. It is not logical to conclude that Al-Hussain was politically victorious or that he was able to save Islam, nor was there anything special about Yazeed for one to assume that Islam was in a great new danger in the first place. The only victory for Al-Hussain is his martyrdom and the rewards that Allah will bestow upon him for  attaining that martyrdom.</p>
<h3><strong>d) Al-Hussain&#8217;s Final Advice to Sayeda Zainab</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the earliest narration by Abu Mikhnaf, when Al-Hussain realized that he was going to battle, he said to Sayeda Zainab: “O’ sister, do not break what I swore, for you shall not tear your pockets, scratch your face, or call for death upon yourself because of what becomes of me.” (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1039)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In modern times, <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram" rel="external nofollow">Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram</a> calls for the exact opposite. He says: “The things that remind people of al-Husayn (‘a), in their various methods, such as commemorative <em>majalis</em>, mournings, beating the cheeks at homes and in the streets&#8230;, help promote the sect.” He also provides late narrations to support this position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>6- The Real Tragedy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we have established two different accounts, examining the claims as to what makes a greater tragedy is necessary. As we have pointed out, the modern Shia position is that Al-Hussain knowingly sacrificed himself for the greater good. Not only that, but he sacrificed his family, by bringing them along with him to get sacrificed by the army.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary Shias like Al-Muqarram argue that Al-Hussain brought women with him as witnesses. Their role was to speak of what they saw, in order to expose Yazeed and his actions. Yet, this argument does not stand, for it cannot be applied to the children, like Abdullah the infant, as well as the children of Abdullah bin Jafa’ar bin Abi Talib, whom Al-Hussain brought along to be sacrificed along with him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni View</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni position states that Al-Hussain’s martyrdom was a tragedy due to the circumstances. The view held by Sunnis is supported by the earliest Shia position, as per the narration of Abu Mikhnaf,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain was enticed into joining the people of Kufa by the pleas of their people. Were it not for their pleas, he wouldn’t have been a victim. Continuing on, the people of Kufa ditched Al-Hussain out of fear for their own safety. Most importantly, as soon as Al-Hussain realized his predicament, he wishes for his safety and the safety of his family. He appeals to the religiosity of his opponents. Al-Hussain asks them to be sent to Yazeed directly, or to be left to go back from whence he came. However, the pride and tyranny of Umar bin Sa&#8217;ads army outweighed their humanity. Ultimately, they killed Al-Hussain, who did not wish for any bloodshed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hurr bin Yazeed puts it perfectly when he cries: “Don’t you accept from these men what they propose?! If the Turks and the Daylam requested this, it would have been impermissible to reject them!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is the tragedy and peace be upon al-Hussein our master.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to Yasser Al-Madani&#8217;s article entitled: &#8220;We Cry for Husayn (as) so did the Prophet of Islam (s).&#8221; The original article can be found on the <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/articles/we-cry-husayn-so-did-prophet-islam-s-yasser-al-madani" rel="external nofollow">al-Islam.org website.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We could focus on the actual liability of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">al-Husayn’s death</a> as attributed to Yazid personally, or Yazid’s character as an individual, but these issues are far less important than addressing some of the trumped up reports to “commemorate” his death. Al-Madani tells us that Shi’ites commemorate Ashura, the day on which al-Husayn was purportedly killed, to not only remember his passing but also to learn about Islam. If that is truly the case, than Islam teaches us to seek out the truth. Instead, we see al-Madani regurgitating the same unreliable reports as many other Shi’ites to discuss the event – and justifying a bid’a (marking this event as a yearly religious holiday) – something his sources don’t support. We can begin by addressing some absurdities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>an archer from the army of Yazid (may Allah’s curse be upon him) shoots a triple-headed arrow, which lodges into Imam al-Hussain’s (AS) heart. He pulls out the arrow causing blood to gush out. The Holy Imam is thirsty. He cries: “O Allah, I am thirsty”… Even when the accursed Shimr approached Imam al-Hussain (AS) to severe his blessed head, he said: “When I approached Hussain ibn Ali and my eyes fell on him, the light of his face so gripped me that I forgot my intention to kill him.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of exaggeration is remarkable. Not only are we to believe that al-Husayn’s heart was pierced by a three headed arrow, but that he pulled the arrow out himself and then even cried out in decibels audible to survivors (who are archers shooting from a distance). We are then to believe that al-Husayn remained alive with a heart and throat pierced long enough that a foot soldier &#8211; Shimr, one of ‘Ali’s own Shi’a prior to this incident &#8211; came over to kill him – implying that he wasn’t dead until Shimr beheaded him. Somehow al-Husayn was gushing blood from wounds to vital organs, but was still able to speak and remained alive until Shimr, his known killer, delivered the final blows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If these are the stories being told on the commemoration day of al-Husayn’s death, are we really learning about Islam or are we just being told fairy tales?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It is reported that when Imam al-Hussain was killed, the sky rained down blood. It has been recorded that Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (AS) has said: “…For no one the heavens wept for forty days save Yahya and Hussain…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are then told to believe that the Heavens wept literal blood, which filled jugs, for a period of forty days. Forty days – the skies rained blood but no account of these wells and jugs of blood exist in a single authentic report? No temporally contemporary non-Muslim chronicler noticed the sky raining blood for forty days? No authentic report of this remarkable phenomenon somehow reached us? Is that even plausible?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the sources al-Madani uses, Agha Pooya – a Shi’I scholar, even tries to diminish the traditions by interpreting the sky raining blood to mean that the moon was red. But the traditions, which are clearly absurd, suggest entire wells were filled with blood (as per the citation from ibn Hajar). Madani cites both, but which is it? Was the moon just red or did we have over a month of raining blood?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Madani states, &#8220;<strong>Show me such a spectacle of human greatness in an event other than <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a> and I will commemorate its memory instead of Karbala!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sure, in Badr 300 men aided by angels overcame an army of well-equipped soldiers in battle and protected Islam. A true spectacle of human greatness such that even the Qur’an mentions it, and yet our Shi’ite brothers revile the very men who participated with the Prophet in this historic battle for the survival of Islam. And how many of them yearly celebrate this victory of Islam?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to al-Madani&#8217;s argumentation, he asks, &#8220;<strong>Let me ask you a question, if a Muslim cries over the passing away of their own relatives, then how can they not cry over the grandson of the Messenger of Allah (S)?</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is because we’ve been taught that there is a fixed period for mourning after the passing of a person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narrated Um−`Atiya: We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days except in the case of a husband… (Bukhari)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s one thing to hear a story and cry over the circumstances. But setting aside a particular day for wailing about an unlawful killing, after mourning beyond three days was declared impermissible, is against the teachings of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Madani continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Holy Qur’an praises crying and those who cry for a legitimate cause. The Holy Qur’an describes many of the Prophets and their followers when they cried, “When the verses of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ayah deliberately deprived of context by the author is about people who cry in awe of the Qur’an and its miracle. The man is literally comparing the crying of a person hearing the Qur’an to crying over make-believe accounts associated with the death of al-Husayn. If it was Allah’s intent that this ayah be a justification for commemorating martyrdom, and not an ayah about the awe of wahi, it would’ve said so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most importantly, al-Madani says, &#8220;<strong>Moreover, we cry over the martyrdom of Imam al-Hussain (AS) for the Holy Prophet (S) wept for Imam al-Hussain (AS).</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Traditions of this nature were reported through different chains. Al-Husayn would’ve been aware of this Prophetic tradition before embarking on his journey. And if al-Husayn was aware that he was actually going to die while approaching Kerbala at that point in time, then he led women and children to their death knowingly. What sort of man takes women and children to be murdered? To become ‘sacrifical lambs’ (Madani’s words) in an unsuccessful campaign to allegedly overthrow Yazid’s government? What lessons are these people deriving from such absurdities? In the author’s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>He looks around, searching for members of his family and his companions, only to find them brutally slaughtered and slain like sacrificial lambs, lying there on the ground soaked in blood. He hears the innocent crying and wailing of the children and the women. Tears flow down his holy face.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And this very aspect of al-Husayn’s martyrdom points to the reality that he wasn’t aware he would be martyred or that he was actually marching into a battle that day. That he wasn’t fomenting a rebellion, and that his motives at that point, far be it to fight the government of Yazid, were very different. Because it is one thing to set out and seek death against a tyrant. It’s another to take your family, women and children to the slaughter. It is one thing for the willing martyr to give his own life for Allah – but another entirely to lead women and children into death with you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further, one of the traditions cited by Madani reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ummul Fadhl the daughter of al-Harith said that she entered on the Messenger of Allah (S) and she said: “Oh! Messenger of Allah, I saw a strange dream last night. He said: And what is it? She said: It was difficult. He said: And what is it? She said: I saw, as if, a piece of your body was severed and was put in my lap! The Messenger of Allah (S) said: You saw well &#8211; Fatima will give birth, God willing, a boy so he will be in your lap. Then Fatima gave birth to al-Hussain (AS) and he was in my lap &#8211; just as the Messenger of Allah (S) said. So I entered one day on the Messenger of Allah (S) and put him in his lap, but I noticed that the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (S) pouring tears! So I said: Oh! Prophet of Allah, my parents are your ransom, what is with you? He said: Gabriel (AS) came to me and informed me that my nation (ummah) will kill this son of mine.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we accept this tradition as true, it contradicts another point made by the author. The author is angered at the thought that the people who opposed and ultimately led to the battle that Husayn died in were non-Muslim. This tradition however implies that they were Muslim as it has Gabriel suggesting that the Prophet’s own Ummah will kill Husayn. Madani wants to have his cake and eat it too. If al-Husayn was a martyr and not somebody who was simply killed unlawfully, he must’ve been killed by non-Muslims – but the very traditions he uses to suggest Prophetic awareness of this event contradicts this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Madani concludes that &#8220;<strong>we cry for Imam al-Hussain (AS) because so did the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (S). Every year we continue and revive the message of Karbala by mourning.</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, based on Madani’s own statements, the marking of this event appears to have less to do with learning about Islam and more about spreading exaggerated stories that have no merit about a renowned Sahabi’s demise. How do we learn about Islam in this commemoration if we’re telling unbelievable fantasies of men ripping arrows out of their hearts and continuing to live?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And even though the Prophet cried for al-Husayn, he did so on one occasion according to this report &#8211; when news of the death reached him. He didn’t turn it into a yearly commemoration. So the argument of our friends holds no weight. If the Prophet wanted us to commemorate this event yearly – and he was aware of it – he would’ve told us to do so. Case closed.</p>
