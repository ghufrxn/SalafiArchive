<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[sa] (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>



<p>Earlier in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the expositions</a> of Answering-Ansar’s lies, it was shown how even a narration found in one of the most prominent Islamic texts, <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, became a target of their deceptive methodology of argumentation because it proves the marriage of `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb with Umm Kulthūm bint `Alī (ra). Of course, those who are familiar with Answering-Ansar and the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> paranoia concerning this marriage know that their deception would not simply end at blatantly lying about the text of the narration.</p>



<p>That narration is:</p>



<p>قال ثعلبة بن أبي مالك إن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قسم مروطا بين نساء من نساء المدينة فبقي مرط جيد فقال له بعض من عنده يا أمير المؤمنين أعط هذا ابنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم التي عندك يريدون أم كلثوم بنت علي فقال عمر أم سليط أحق وأم سليط من نساء الأنصار ممن بايع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال عمر فإنها كانت تزفر لنا القرب يوم أحد</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik said: ‘`Umar (ra) divided up some garments among some of the women of Madīna. One excellent garment remained and one of those with him said: ‘Commander of the believers! Give this to the (grand) daughter of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) to whom you are married—meaning Umm Kul<u>th</u>ūm the daughter of `Alī. `Umar (ra) replied: ‘Umm Salīţ is more entitled. Umm Salīţ was one of the people of Anşār who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allāh (saws).’ `Umar (ra) added: ‘She carried waterskins for us on the day of Uĥud.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 3, page 222 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>After disapproving the text of this narration by lying and advancing a barrage of inane and poorly constructed linguistic arguments, the Answering-Ansar team moves on to criticize its chain of transmission.</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The people of knowledge can identify the deceptive nature of this argument as soon as they first read it. In fact, even a student of knowledge can. But for those who do not know, this analysis concerning the chain of transmission by the Answering-Ansar team is based on transparent dishonesty.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar has stated that the chain of transmission of this narration is unreliable because it is related by Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra). To support this claim, they have proposed the following points about Tha`laba (ra):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is not mentioned in any of the texts pertaining to <em>r</em><em>ijāl</em> [narrators of <em>ĥadī<u>th</u></em>].</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Dhahabī, who includes “all manner” of narrators in his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, has not mentioned him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is a completely unknown person.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, let us examine these claims and observe how much truth there is to them:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One – Tha`laba (ra) in the Texts of <em>Rijāl</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik’s “name is extant from the texts of rijjal.” This, unfortunately, is a barefaced lie because Tha`laba (ra) is mentioned in both <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts of narrator-biographies [<em>rijāl</em>].</p>

</ul>



<p>And in case there remains any doubt, let us also quote some of the abovementioned works so the readers know what the texts of <em>rijāl</em> say about him under his biographical&nbsp;entry&nbsp;[<em>tarjama</em>].</p>



<p>The author of the <em>Şaĥīĥ</em>, Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī himself, writes in <em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي المديني كان كبيرا امام بني قريظة سمع عمر وحارثة بن النعمان وعن ابن عمر سمع منه ابن الهاد والزهري وابنه مالك</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī al-Madīnī: He was great; <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža. He heard narrations from `Umar, Ĥāri<u>th</u>a ibn al-Nu`mān and Ibn `Umar, and Ibn al-Hād, al-Zuhrī and his son Mālik heard narrations from him.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 2, page 174 [Diyarbakir]</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the head <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī, writes in his <em>Rijāl</em> while listing the Companions (ra) who narrated from the Prophet (saws):</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk, the Quražī.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Rijāl al-Ţūsī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460), page 31 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī, who was a renowned <em>Sunnī</em> scholar and master of narrations, also mentions in <em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي المديني إمام مسجد بني قريظة أخرج البخاري في الجهاد وغير موضع عن الزهري عنه عن عمر بن الخطاب وقيس بن سعد قال الكلاباذي له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá, al-Quražī al-Madīnī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī has documented (his) narrations in the (book of) <em>Jihād</em>, and another place, from al-Zuhrī, and from `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>aţţāb and Qays ibn Sa`d. al-Kalābā<u>dh</u>ī said: ‘His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ li man <u>Kh</u>arraj `anh al-Bukhārī fī al-Jāmi` al-Şaĥīĥ</em>, of Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī (d. 474), volume 1, page 447 [Marrakech]</li>
</ul>



<p>In his voluminous and illustrious work on narrators, the <em>Sunnī</em> pinnacle Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī states:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي حليف الأنصار أبو مالك ويقال أبو يحيى المدني إمام مسجد بني قريظة له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá—al-Madanī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Kamāl fī Asmā’ al-Rijāl</em>, of Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī (d. 742), volume 4, page 397 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the major <em>Sunnī</em> scholar of narrations and expert in the field of its narrators, Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī, also writes in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي له رؤية وسمع عمر وعنه ابناه منظور وأبو مالك والزهري</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: His vision (of the Prophet) is proven. He heard narrations from `Umar. His two sons Manžūr and Abū Mālik, and al-Zuhrī heard narrations from him.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if fī Ma`rifat man lahu Riwāya min al-Kutub al-Sitta</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 284 [Jeddah]</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Mīrzā Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī, a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and expert in the field of narrators, writes in <em>Manhaj al-Maqāl</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Manhaj al-Maqāl fī Taĥqīq Aĥwāl al-Rijāl</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī (d. 1028), volume 3, page 130 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author of one of the main texts of <em>rijāl</em> among the <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>, al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī writes in the same work:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي من أصحاب الرسول صلى الله عليه وآله</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: He is from the Companions of the Messenger (saws).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī (d. 1044), volume 1, page 317 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> al-Astarābādī’s and al-Tafrishī’s printed works have&nbsp;a diacritical point missing from “al-Quražī” but the correct word is with a point as elucidated by <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> editors.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī also writes:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Jāmi` al-Ruwāt fī Izāĥat al-Ishtibāhāt `an al-Ţuruq wa al-Isnād</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī (d. 1101), volume 1, page 140 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in short, the famous and major texts of <em>rijāl</em> separately&nbsp;mention&nbsp;Tha`laba (ra) with words that prove nothing but his praiseworthiness. But the Answering-Ansar team confidently “refutes” the chain of transmission by deceptively misleading their readers into thinking that the texts of <em>rijāl</em> do not even mention the <em>name</em> of Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two – al-Dhahabī and his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em></h2>



<p>Answering-Ansar states about Tha`laba:</p>

<p>This is what one calls mixing the truth with falsehood. al-Dhahabī has mentioned the biography of Tha`laba (ra) in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>, <em>Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Islām</em> and <em>al-Tajrīd</em>. A quote from <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em> has already been cited and the following is what al-Dhahabī states about him in his dictionary of the Companions of the Prophet (saws), <em>al-Tajrīd</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي إمام بني قريظة ولد في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وله رؤية وطال عمره روى عنه إبنه أبو مالك وصفوان بن سليم له حديثان مرسلان</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá,</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe. He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and his vision (of him) is proven. He lived a long age. His son Abū Mālik and Şafwān ibn Sulaym narrated from him. He has two dispatched narrations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tajrid_sahaba_1_69.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Tajrīd Asmā’ al-Şaĥāba</em>, of <u>Sh</u>ams al-Dīn al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 69 [Beirut]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What the Answering-Ansar team did is that they deceivingly left all these works behind and jumped to <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, while covering the act by lying that the author has mentioned the biographies of “all manner” of narrators in it. The truth, however, is different. It is a known fact that al-Dhahabī has not included all types of narrators in his <em>Mīzān</em>. In fact, <em>Mīzān</em> is a work on narrators whose reliability has been questioned and therefore he has not included many narrators in it, including the Companions of the Prophet (saws).</p>



<p>He explicitly states about the Companions (ra) in the introduction of the work:</p>



<p>ولا أذكرهم في هذا المصنف فإن الضعف إنما جاء من جهة الرواة إليهم وكذا لا أذكر في كتابي من الآئمة المتبوعين في الفروع أحدا لجلالتهم في الاسلام وعظمتهم في النفوس</p>



<p><strong>“I will <u>not mention</u> them in this compilation, for the weakness has come from the sub-narrators that are linked to them. Similarly, I will not mention any of the followed <em>Imāms</em> in this book, such as Abū Ĥanīfa, al-<u>Sh</u>āfi`ī and al-Bu<u>kh</u>arī due their majesty in Islam and essential greatness.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl fī Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 3 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The highly praised <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar al-Mīrzā Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339) also confirms this while criticizing both <em>Sunnīs</em> and al-Dhahabī:</p>



<p>هذا الذهبي على إمامته وجلالته عندهم تأنف من ذكر الصحابة في كتابه</p>



<p><strong>“This al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī, despite of his scholarly leadership and loftiness according to them, utterly detested the mention of the Companions in his book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Qawl al-Şurāĥ fī al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī wa Şaĥīĥih al-Jāmi`</em>, of Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339), page 42 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus, the reason why al-Dhahabī has not included Tha`laba (ra) in his <em>Mīzān</em> is because he is a Companion, as mentioned by him in <em>al-Tajrīd</em>, not because he is unknown, and Answering-Ansar’s claim that al-Dhahabī has included the “biographies of all manner” of narrators in it is yet another example of their dishonesty and misrepresentation of <em>Sunnī</em> texts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three – “Completely Unknown”?</h2>



<p>It has been shown above that the biography of Tha`laba (ra) has been mentioned in over a dozen <em>Sunnī</em> and <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts of narrator-biographies. If someone actually goes through other texts such as compilations of narrations, commentaries and genealogical works,&nbsp;there is no doubt that a lot more can be read about Tha`laba (ra).</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) writes in <em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>Th</u></strong><strong>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk:</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> [al-Ţūsī] has mentioned him among the Companions of the Messenger (saws). This is how the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> has named his father, ‘Abī Malīk.’ However, it is ‘ibn Abī Mālik’ in <em>al-Ţabaqāt</em>, <em>al-Istī`āb</em>, <em>Usd al-<u>Gh</u>āba</em>, <em>al-Işāba</em> and <em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Muĥammad ibn Sa`d said in <em>al-Ţabaqāt al-Kabīr</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh ibn Sām, and <u>Th</u>a`laba is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ Abī Mālik came from Yemen and said: ‘We are from the tribe of Kindah which is on the Jewish religion.’ He then married into the Ibn Sa`ya (family) of the Qurayža tribe and confederated with them; thus it was said: ‘the Quražī.’ He has narrated from `Umar and `U<u>th</u>mān. He used be given the cognomen of ‘Abū Ja`far.’ <u>Th</u>a`laba was <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža until he passed away. He was great and did not narrate many narrations.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in <em>al-Istī`āb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws). The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh, and he—meaning, <u>Th</u>a`laba—is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá’ from Kindah. His father came from Yemen, on the Jewish religion. He was accommodated by the Qurayža tribe and thus he is ascribed to them. He was not one of them, so he accepted Islam. He narrated from `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān and all the Companions.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in </strong><strong><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ His vision (of the Prophet) is proven</strong><strong>. He narrated from the Prophet (saws), `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān, Jābir, Ĥāritha ibn al-Nu`mān and a large group. His two sons Abū Mālik and Manžūr, al-Zuhrī, al-Miswar ibn Rifā`a, Muĥammad ibn `Uqba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, Şafwān ibn Sulaym and others narrated from him. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī said: ‘He was great,&nbsp;<em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža and&nbsp;on the Jewish religion. He married a woman from the tribe of Qurayža and thus he was ascribed to them, while he was (originally) from Kindah. Tha`laba used to lead the tribe of Qurayža in his youth. Abū Ĥātim said: ‘He is from the predecessors.’ al-`Ijlī said: ‘A trustworthy predecessor.’ And Ibn Ĥibbān mentioned him in <em>al-<u>Th</u>iqāt</em> [“The Trustworthy Narrators”].’</strong><strong>’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is not known whether he falls under the condition of our book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn (d. 1371), volume 4, page 22 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up all of the aforementioned information about Tha`laba (ra) present in <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, it is known that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His ancestors were from Yemen.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and lived a long life.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a Companion of the Prophet (saws).</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His cognomen was Abū Mālik—others also said Abū Yaĥyá.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a confederate of the Anşār.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He narrated from `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb, `Uthmān ibn `Affān (ra), and others.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His sons, al-Zuhrī, and others narrated from him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was the <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe until his demise.</li>
</ul>



<p>In spite of this information that is spread throughout innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, the Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is “a completely unknown personality.”</p>



<p>Can this be called anything but outright lying?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>It has been evidently shown that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is not an unknown or unreliable narrator, rather a Companion of the Prophet (saws) whose biography is present in innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, and particularly the texts of <em>rijāl</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to explicitly say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Once again, it has been shown how Answering-Ansar chooses deceptive methods of argumentation by blatantly lying about narrators and Islamic texts for the sole reason of denying a narration that goes against their view.</p>



<p><strong>Is this what the Answering-Ansar team means by their motto, “Revealing the Truth”?</strong></p>



<p>We will let the readers decide.</p>



<p>As for the “Undh” absurdity, that has been covered in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the earlier expositions</a>.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

In such examples, one is exposed to the epitome of textual criticism and the meticulousness of Sunni scholarship with regards to the transmission of hadith. The examples become even more fascinating when the hadith critics provide a story and/or the context behind their verdicts, which allows us to fully grasp their reasoning.</p>
<p>Around a year ago, I came across a very interesting example of this phenomenon. It involved a 4th century Shi&#8217;ite transmitter known as Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath. Muhammad was a Kufan transmitter who eventually settled in Egypt in the vicinity known as <em>Saqifat Jawad</em>. The hadith critic, Al-Daraqutni (d. 385) described him saying: &#8220;He was a wonder among Allah’s wonders. He fabricated that book, <em>Al-‘Alawiyyat.</em>&#8221; (Al-Sahmi 101)</p>
<p>Though Al-Daraqutni&#8217;s statement is sufficient and insightful, it does not provide much context behind his verdict. Fortunately, however, another notable hadith critic witnessed and documented the entire story behind Muhammad&#8217;s exposé. This critic, in fact, was a direct student of Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>How the Forger was Identified</strong></span></p>
<p>In his book, <em>Al-Kamil fi Du&#8217;afaa&#8217; Al-Rijal</em>, the 4th century hadith critic, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy (d. 365) relayed his own account regarding the forger in question today. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I transcribed hadith from him. His staunchness in Shi’ism led him to disseminate a transcription that consisted of around 1000 reports transmitted from Musa b. Isma’il b. Musa b. Ja’far, from his father, from his grandfather, from his fathers, with a soft handwriting and new parchment. Most of it consisted of disapproved reports (مناكير).</p>
<p>We then brought this up to Al-Husain b. ‘Ali b. Al-Husain b. ‘Umar b. ‘Ali b. Al-Husain Al-‘Alawi, the <em>sheikh</em> of Ahlulbait in Egypt. He stated that Musa was his neighbor in the city for 40 years and that he never mentioned that he had transmission from his father or anyone else. (Ibn &#8216;Adiyy 7/565)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Adiyy then concluded his entry saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have copied this book from him, and it consists of around 1000 hadiths written in soft handwriting. I have copied most of it from him  along with these hadiths and other disapproved reports in this book. It contains some reports that match the contents of the reports of truthful transmitters, and he was suspected of fabricating this book. I did not find an <em>Asl</em> for him in this book. He used to simply present it to us in soft handwriting and new parchment. (Ibn &#8216;Adiyy 7/567)</p></blockquote>
<p>In Muhammad&#8217;s biographical entry, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy listed some of the preposterous forgeries he observed in the book, which clearly are fabricated Prophetic traditions.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What Happened?</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to dissect Ibn &#8216;Adiyy&#8217;s account and direct the reader to the subtle and explicit indicators this hadith critic appealed to when issuing his verdict.</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Adiyy began his account by stating that he had actually transcribed hadith from Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath. This is a valuable piece of data, as we now know that Ibn &#8216;Adiyy knew him on a personal level and that he was acquainted with his practices in transmission. Ibn &#8216;Adiyy is not simply criticizing someone he knows nothing about. As a student and acquaintance of Muhammad, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy then made note of his staunch Shi&#8217;ite leanings. This too is a valuable bit of information, since it informs us of a motive and a bias this transmitter may have possessed in the context of hadith transmission.</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Adiyy then mentioned that Muhammad&#8217;s staunch Shi&#8217;ite leanings led him to disseminate an entire book of 1000 hadiths he had allegedly transmitted from Musa b. Isma&#8217;il b. Musa b. Ja&#8217;far. Perhaps some context is needed to clarify this point: Musa b. Isma&#8217;il is an absolutely unknown and obscure transmitter in both the Sunni and Shi&#8217;ite traditions (Al-Jawaheri 624). It is indeed very bizarre that such an absolutely unknown figure would be a prolific transmitter of reports, since frequent transmission usually granted transmitters exposure to various authorities who would be able to identify them. The fact that Muhammad exclusively transmitted 1000 reports from this obscure and allegedly prolific transmitter is a major red flag.</p>
<p>Another notable point is that the obscure Musa b. Isma&#8217;il was the grandson of the 7th Shi&#8217;ite imam, Musa b. Ja&#8217;far, and the great-great-grandson of the 6th imam, Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadeq. Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath ascribed the reports in his book to Musa b. Isma&#8217;il → Isma&#8217;il b. Musa → Musa b. Ja&#8217;far → Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadeq. We are aware of Muhammad&#8217;s theological leanings, which would entice him to ascribe reports to the following figures. We can thus conclude that Muhammad&#8217;s transmission in his book is in-line with any theological motive he may have possessed in that context.</p>
<p>More than once, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy made note of the fact that Muhammad&#8217;s book was written on new parchment. This, in light of the other indicators, is another red flag. It means that the text was only recently written, and that the transcription was not an aged document which had been preserved by Muhamamd years after his transmission from Musa b. Isma&#8217;il. Ibn &#8216;Adiyy similarly made note of the fact that the reports in the book are bizarre and disapproved traditions (مناكير).</p>
<p>These major red-flags (rightfully) were enough of a reason to arouse suspicion in Ibn &#8216;Adiyy. Since Muhammad had exclusively ascribed ~1000 reports to Isma&#8217;il b. Musa, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy consulted a member of Isma&#8217;il b. Musa&#8217;s household: Al-Husain b. ‘Ali Al-‘Alawi, the <em>sheikh</em> of Ahlulbait in Egypt at the time. Al-Husain b. &#8216;Ali confirmed Ibn &#8216;Adiyy&#8217;s suspicions: he was Musa b. Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s neighbor for over 40 years, yet he never heard him transmitting anything from his father or anyone else!</p>
<p>At that stage, it became apparent that Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath was a forger who had fabricated the entire book and ascribed its contents to Isma&#8217;il b. Musa. It probably was easier for him to ascribe the book to an obscure figure, like Isma&#8217;il, since ascribing it to a more eminent figure of many students would have probably lead to his immediate exposé.</p>
<p>Note: Ibn &#8216;Adiyy importantly noted that some of the contents in the book were taken from the reports of truthful transmitters and then arbitrarily ascribed to Muhammad&#8217;s chain of transmission. Thus, the fact that some of the reports in Muhammad&#8217;s book may be found in other sources does not absolve him from the forgery of this book.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Blunder of Shi&#8217;ite Biographical Sources</strong></span></p>
<p>Muhammad&#8217;s own student, Ibn &#8216;Adiyy (d. 365), assessed a variety of significant textual indicators  and thus accused Muhammad of forging the book. The great hadith critic, Al-Daraqutni (d. 385), similarly concluded that he was behind its forgery. What is surprising, however, is that later Shi&#8217;ite biographical sources ended up endorsing the reliability of Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Al-Ash&#8217;ath!</p>
<p>Al-Najashi (d. 450) described him saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>He is reliable and among our companions in Egypt. He authored <em>Kitab Al-Hajj</em>. In it, he mentioned the reports the <em>&#8216;Ammah</em> (Sunnis) transmitted from Ja&#8217;far b. Muhammad regarding Hajj. (Al-Khoei 18/200)</p></blockquote>
<p>Al-Tusi (d. 460) described him saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>He is nicknamed Abu &#8216;Ali, and his residence was in Egypt in <em>Saqifat Jawad. </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He transmitted a transcription from Musa b. Isma&#8217;il b. Musa b. Ja&#8217;far, from his father: Isma&#8217;il b. Musa b. Ja&#8217;far, from his father: Musa b. Ja&#8217;far (as). </span>(Al-Khoei 18/200)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p>In conclusion, we have Muhammad&#8217;s own contemporaries meticulously evaluating his transmission and concluding that he cannot be relied upon. More than one hundred years later, Shi&#8217;ite authorities who never met Muhammad mysteriously (and ambiguously) concluded that he was a reliable transmitter! It is evident, however, that Muhammad is a problematic transmitter (to say the least). Ibn &#8216;Adiyy&#8217;s account gives the reader a brief glimpse into the critical methods espoused by the competent hadith critics of the past.</p>
<p>Indeed this example is but another reason to cast doubts upon the reliability of Shi&#8217;ite biographical (<em>rijali</em>) sources and their respective verdicts. What is further damning is that this forged waste of paper has survived till this day, and it has been printed and circulated in some Shi&#8217;ite circles as a valid primary source. The book is now referred to as الأشعثيات or الجعفريات.</p>

<p>I have amassed a list of analogous instances where Shi&#8217;ite sources have endorsed known liars, forgers, and weak transmitters, and perhaps I shall publish it here soon, God willing.</p>
<p>And Allah is the best of witnesses.</p>
