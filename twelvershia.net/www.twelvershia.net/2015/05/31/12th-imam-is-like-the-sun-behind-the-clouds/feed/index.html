Bro,

Your comment makes no sense, first of all these aren&#039;t the words of an &quot;Ayatullat&quot; this is from a Shiite Hadith which they attribute to the Prophet (saw). Secondly, that Hadith compares the benefit derived from a hidden leader to that of the sun behind the clouds, so you come and tell me that if the sun was out then this is also damaging? You&#039;re basically further destroying your own corrupt narration, in addition I say that those who believe that a hidden un-available leader is beneficial are &quot;not smart enough&quot;, heck any leader is more useful than a hidden un-available leader. As for those places you mentioned like Canada and the UK and whatever (seems you clearly haven&#039;t lived there) , maybe you don&#039;t realize that they get a lot of sunlight and have never been deprived of the sun for 1,200 years. As for Wilayat al-Faqih this is a recent Shiite invention and many Shiite scholars opposed it and still oppose it to this day, it wasn&#039;t an order of the hidden un-available leader.As for Shiites being safe from Fitnah, maybe you should think about Iraq the Shiite heartland which is engulfed with Fitnah, or Iran the biggest factory of atheism and atheists in the region.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;With no solar radiation to provide for photosynthesis, most plant matter would rapidly die. The people would have no grain to make bread, no fruits and vegetables. Animals dependent upon plants would die, and within the space of a few years, humanity would face a catastrophic food crises, leading to mass starvation and famine. The progression of civilisation as we know it would come to a crashing halt, and the extinction of the entirety of humanity would rapidly follow.&quot;

If that is so, will you please explain why places like the whole continent of Africa, that receives solar radiation all year round is suffering from drought, famine, mass starvation and civil wars? And places like Scandinavia, Canada, United Kingdom, Iceland and Siberia, where the sun is covered by clouds all year round are one of the most advanced, civilized, pluralistic and literate nations in the world? Can you provide scientific and logical explanations for that?

Either you did not wholly udnerstand what the Ayatollah said or not smart enough.

And despite having Imams who are visible and accessible you are dealing with problems like Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, ISIS, Tehrik-e-Taliban while thanks to Allah SWT the hidden Imam left us with an earthly representative to guide the Ummah, in a concept known as Wilayat-e-Fiqh. Admitted that political turmoil in the Middle East, Arab vs Persian competition, European colonialism and globalization has led to confusions and disagreements but nevertheless the entirety of Shia have been safe from the fitna engulfing the whole Muslim Ummah.]]></description>
