If you do not believe that Islam was triumphant/glorious in the first century, then you and other Shias should stop using this hadith as evidence for your Imams. Problem solved.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How was Islam triumphant/glorious when:
1) the daughter of 1st caliph is thirsty for the blood of th 4th caliph? and waging jamal war against him resulting in more than 20,000 deaths?
2) muslims wage 3 civil wars with up to 40-50,000 killed in a period of 4 years during Imam Ali (as) caliphate?
3) some sahabas burn Ali&#039;s house, kill his wife and force him to give allegiance to the 1st caliph?
4) a lot of the sahaba and muslims wanted their 3rd caliph dead and seized his house for days and eventually brutally killing him?
5) it was sunnah to curse the 4th caliph on pulpits for decades?
6) your 6th caliph was thirsty for the blood of the 4th and and 5th caliph?
7) the Prophet (pbuh) curses the 6th caliph, during his lifetime.
8) the 7th caliph orders the brutal killing of Hussain (as) son of the 4th caliph and brother of the 5th caliph?
9) none of these 12 caliphs claimed to be a member of the 12 caliphs the Prophet (pbuh) referred to.]]></description>

Sister, you sound like you come from a Shia background, even if you do not adopt their views right now. I assume this since you say, &quot;Islam is lost no matter what sect you belong to.&quot; Be aware that Sunnis do not believe that all Twelve Shia Imams were scholars. We only hold that view for the first six. The other six were not known by us to be significant at all. Other Shia sects will agree that the late Imams were not as significant, since many Shia sects were formed in Abbasid era that did not accept the last few Imams. 
Due to the this, the narration makes especially no sense if we assumed the Shia understanding was the correct one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my point of view. Islam is lost no matter what sect you belong to. There is no real leader. Who has the right word or fatwa. Now its all based in studies of hadeeth and opinions. But the message and connection with Allah is lost.
And this is exactly what this hadeeth talks about. Its not about Glory or success. Its about Upright. The Pure Islam without alterations will remain until 12 caliphs will pass. All of them from Quraish. So for the Shia view it does have sense. All Imams of Shia were known even by the sunni for their knowledge. Instead the corruption in Sunni leaders started right after Muawiya and Yazeed.
Our Prophet Muhammad saaw was our best leader. The pure Islam existed with him. He was the city of knowledge and Ali was his gate. The first muslim. The one who was raised up with him and knew him better. And his descendants passed on that knowledge. Imam Jaafar was teacher of many important sunni scholars. How to deny that knowledge wasnt in their family.

But after Imam Mahdi disappeared, the pure Islam was lost.

Now our religion.. and the fatwas leaders make its based on their opinions. Its all lost. We can just ask Allah to accept our practice. I wish Prophet Muhammad saaw was with us. We need him so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have gathered pretty much all of its texts and translated the variations in the narration of Samura bin Jundub:

-Simak:
لَا يَزَالُ الْإِسْلَامُ عَزِيزًا إِلَى اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;Islam shall remain strong until twelve caliphs.&quot;

-Ibn abi `Umar from `Abdul-Malik:
لَا يَزَالُ أَمْرُ النَّاسِ مَاضِيًا مَا وَلِيَهُمُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ رَجُلًا
&quot;The people&#039;s affair shall progress as long as they&#039;re led by twelve men.&quot;

-Ibn Mahdi from `Abdul-Malik:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الْأَمْرُ صَالِحًا حَتَّى يَكُونَ اثْنَا عَشَرَ أَمِيرًا
&quot;This matter shall remain good until twelve chiefs (rule).&quot;

-Abu `Abdul-Samad from `Abdul-Malik:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الدِّينُ عَزِيزًا أَوْ قَالَ لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ، شَكَّ أَبُو عَبْدِ الصَّمَدِ إِلَى اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This religion shall remain strong OR he said the people shall remain in goodness (the narrator was unsure) until twelve caliphs.&quot;

-Dawoud from Sha`bi:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الْأَمْرُ عَزِيزًا إِلَى اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This matter shall remain strong until twelve caliphs&quot;

-Mujalid from Sha`bi:
إِنَّ هَذَا الدِّينَ لَنْ يَزَالَ ظَاهِرًا عَلَى مَنْ نَاوَأَهُ، لَا يَضُرُّهُ مُخَالِفٌ وَلَا مُفَارِقٌ، حَتَّى يَمْضِيَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This religion shall remain victorious over its opponents, unharmed by those who oppose it or leave it, until twelve caliphs from my nation come to pass.&quot;

-Ibn `Awn from Sha`bi:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الدِّينُ عَزِيزًا مَنِيعًا إِلَى اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This religion shall remain strong and fortified until twelve caliphs.&quot;

-`Amir bin Sa`d:
لَا يَزَالُ الدِّينُ قَائِمًا حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَةُ أَوْ يَكُونَ عَلَيْكُمُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً كُلُّهُمْ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ
&quot;The religion will remain to be upright until the hour or you are ruled by twelve caliphs all from Quraysh.&quot;

-Isma`il bin Hurmuz from Hurmuz:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الدِّينُ قَائِمًا حَتَّى يَكُونَ عَلَيْكُمُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً كُلُّهُمْ تَجْتَمِعُ عَلَيْهِ الْأُمَّةُ
&quot;The religion will remain to be upright until you are ruled by twelve caliphs, the nation shall gather united around them.&quot;

-Fitr from Hurmuz:
لَا يَزَالُ هَذَا الْأَمْرُ مُؤَاتًي أَوْ مُقَارِبًا حَتَّى يَقُومَ اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This matter shall continue to be appropriate or adequate until the rule of twelve caliphs.&quot;

-Hosayn:
لا يَزَالُ هَذَا الدِّينُ قَائِمًا حَتَّى يَقُومَ اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;The religion will continue to be upright until the rule of twelve caliphs.&quot;

-Hosayn:
إِنَّ هَذَا الأَمْرَ لاَ يَنْقَضِي حَتَّى يَمْضِيَ فِيهِمُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ خَلِيفَةً
&quot;This matter shall not come to pass until twelve caliphs rule them.&quot;

-Musayyib:
إِنَّ هَذَا الأَمْرَ لا يَزَالُ ظَاهِرًا لا يَضُرُّهُ خِلافُ مَنْ خَالَفَهُ حَتَّى يُؤَمَّرَ اثْنَا عَشَرَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي كُلُّهُمْ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ
&quot;This matter will remain to be victorious, unharmed by the opposition of any opponent until twelve from my nation receive authority, all of them from Quraysh.&quot;]]></description>
