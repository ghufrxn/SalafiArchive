					<description><![CDATA[O People of the Ahadith! Shias and Sunnis! Why can&#039;t you understand that the reason why the first Khalifas wanted to destroy the Hadiths is because they were True Mu&#039;mineen, and they knew that the ahadith were not to be considered a source of the religion of Islam because in them there could be much falsehood? Allah in the Quran warns us, but the sects hide and distort these warnings.
Our prophet has left us the Quran from Allah as our light and guidance.

Why don&#039;t you read this article which I found interesting, if Allah wills you will get some light: [LINKING TO OTHER WEBSITES PROHIBITED]]]></description>
