					<description><![CDATA[The Shia Hadiths of Tahreef are not muttwatir.  All Hadiths are corrupted. I believe the early Shia were faced with an identity crisis and these reports of Tahreef crept into the writings. I saw this because the famous hadith Al-Thaqalayn says &quot;Hold fast to the Quran and MY family&quot;.  This means the Quran has to be protected no if ands or buts about it. The Shia hadiths definitely were contaminated especially Qummi where he says believers become believers because of the clay they were made from. This means people don&#039;t have a chance they are born evil or good. Obviously this is in direct conflict with Islam. So even though some early Shia authors have Tahreef traditions, they should obviously be ignored.]]></description>
