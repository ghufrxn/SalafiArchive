Wa `Aleykum al-Salam,

Yazid was an oppressive king who did whatever it took to keep himself in the seat of authority (which lasted for four years). That&#039;s the view of the majority of scholars and it is popular and famous. The historical controversy is regarding whether Yazid gave direct orders to execute al-Husayn and his household or not. Either way, he is surely responsible and accountable for his decisions and Allah will judge him with absolute justice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

From reading your articles on Ahlul-Bayt (a.s) I get the impression that all Jihad and good deeds done by Imam Ali (a.s) and his Children (a.s) who were given Imamate are fairy tales or myths created by Shias. 

Anyways, I have a question about Yazeed.

Muawiya&#039;s son Yazeed.. for some he is also pious believer who would be sent to Paradise to be with his ancestors. 

There is a narration of Hadhrat Umar (r.a) on accountability of Caliph of Muslims, &quot;Even if a dog dies hungry on the banks of the River Euphrates, Umar (r.a) will be responsible for dereliction of duty.&quot; 

I don&#039;t know if this accountability is applicable on Yazeed or not as during his period of Caliphate... Imam Hussain (a.s) grandson of Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) was purportedly killed, forces was sent against people of Medina and burning of Holy House Kaaba. 

If these 3 events are true and did happen during caliphate of Yazeed... does that mean Yazeed would be held accountable or not as he was Caliph during that period and being a Caliph is no joke... that is when good happens Caliph should be given due credit but when bad happens people are responsible. Caliph Umar (r.a) narration proves Hadhrat Umar (r.a) himself believed in the Accountability of Caliph for Bad &#038; Evil events both in this World and Hereafter.]]></description>
