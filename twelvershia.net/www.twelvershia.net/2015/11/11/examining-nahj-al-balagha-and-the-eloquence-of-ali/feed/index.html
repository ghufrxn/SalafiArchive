Salam,

Sorry for cutting your comment short, your original comment was four times the size of what we accepted above. We are going to be strict in accepting long comments from now on and we will urge all to make their points brief and simple. As for your claim, nobody here said the Nahj was not eloquent. We said that eloquence does not mean that `Ali actually said these things. A large amount of Arabs were eloquent and many were poets who could come up with texts just as eloquent easily and we&#039;ve provided some examples in previous comments. As for your claim that we can&#039;t compare Nahj&#039;s eloquence to authentic prophetic-sayings, this is where you fail, because the Nahj contains texts that are a lot more eloquent than most prophetic-sayings whether in Sunni or Shia books. The words written in the Nahj seem to be at variance with the language of the simple Arabs in the time of the Prophet (saw), Arabs used to express themselves with short simple and precise language for the most part and so did the Prophet (saw). The eloquent sermons attributed to Ibn `Awf, `Umar, `Ali etc... are usually shaky in their chains, some are authentically attributed but many are not. Our issue is that Shia accept them as `Ali&#039;s words simply because they sound good, this is un-academic and plain stupid. Thank You.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Talking of eloquence in the early Islamic period then is hardly much to compare with the Nahjul Balaghah, apart from the Quran (which set the standard) and Prophetic hadeeth (which again is a prime example). There are other examples of early Islamic Arabic eloquence which have come down to us. However, the Arabic of Nahjul Balaghah is undoubtedly eloquent, and recognized by both non-Muslims and non-bigoted, open-minded Muslims (naasibis are an exception, of course!), It&#039;ll be stupid to compare it with, for example, the Quran or the hadeeth since all Muslims believe that the Quran set the standard of eloquence and Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (brought up in the Prophet&#039;s house by he himself) always said that whatever he knows he does so because of what the Prophet taught him so comparing it to authentic hadeeth is futile....

					<description><![CDATA[Any Arab school-child of today could write a sermon without dots. Just hop in a time machine and travel back to before the Arabic alphabet was dotted, and they can use every letter! How do Shi`ah not realize this?]]></description>
