					<description><![CDATA[Dear all

Message of Islam and all school of thoughts is &quot;salam&quot; peace. I think its a great discussion but do we really need to call each other, dumb, blind etc.

its 1 million or 10 million or 100 million. At the end its a great ceberation of what imam Hussain did for the religion. He does not belong to shia or sunni. Its one the greatest story of human dignity and steadfastness for doing the right thing.

We should all base our evaluations on fact and no matter what pls lets debate with respect and humility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you 12shia.net for such a great information. I really did not know about all these gold stuff. Seriously I start believing in miracles. If Karbla cannot accommodate even a million people then how is it possible that every year the number of pilgrims are more then 5 million on Ashoura and more the 20 million on Arbaen. It is such a miracle.
Secondly, you mentioned about shrines are made up of GOLD!! Seriously? Wallahi I want to visit Karbla Again.
Labaik Ya Hussain (a.s)
Seriously if anyone wants to see miracles on earth should visit KARBLA.
Thank you 12shia.net for telling us all these miracles.
And Alhamdulillah I was part of ASHOURA 2017, and next year I will be a part of Arbaen. So next year the number of Arbaens will be 20 million and “1”.]]></description>

Oh and by the way, you kept claiming that Karbala does not promote extravagance and that Makkah is occupied by forces of greed who waste money whereas Karbala requires humility etc...

Your argument would make a little bit of sense if your Shia Shrine wasn&#039;t made of SOLID GOLD!!! Are you mentally deficient!? Criticizing the extravagance in Makkah when we&#039;re discussing your golden shrine!?

Here, let me remind you of the history of your shrine:

1384 ce	The two minarets were reconstructed of gold by Sultan Ahmad ibn `Uways. The courtyard was also extended.

1796 ce	Aghā Muhammad Shāh Qājār covered the dome with gold. He also decorated the Min’ar and gold plated it.

1817 ce	Fat&#039;h ‘Alī Shāh Qājār reconstructed the screens by plating with silver. He also replated the dome with gold and therefore repaired the damage caused by the Wahhabis.

1939 ce	Syedna Taher Saifuddin, of the Dawoodi Bohra community presented a set of solid silver screens with gold which were attached to the shrine. This set is made of 500 gold coins (each coin consisted 12 grams weight) and 200 thousand coins of silver, beautified with precious gems.

1941 ce	The western minaret was rebuilt by Dr Syedna Taher Saifuddin. He spent a considerable amount gold plating all the Min’ar.

So The first dome is 27 meters high and completely covered with gold.

Please, have some shame before you start criticizing other governments for their mistakes.]]></description>

What is ISLAM? Twelver Shia ideology and writings are the furthest from true and pure Islam. You&#039;d have to be very blessed to be a Shia and still know what is Islam, if you were blessed you wouldn&#039;t be a Twelver in the first place.

I leave you with this image of the northern entrance to Karbala&#039;:
http://www.non14.net/filestorage/contentfiles/2015/01_15/030115093245_140_1.jpg

Also, what will going there accomplish? We have clear aerial images and satellite scans of the location as well as accurate numbers for the total area of the two shrines,  why do you want us to go there ourselves? Scientifically speaking, going there is not helpful at all. Unless you Shia can fly in space or have huge stadiums underground, there&#039;s no way the numbers mentioned by your leaders are accurate, so you can go dream about your 17 million and 22 million, you Shia have been living in a dream since your 11th Imam died.]]></description>
