Salam Alaykum,

One comment I think is important: As far as I know, the traditional Sunni belief is that Prophets are alive in their graves. In fact if anything, I think this is one important points against Shias, as this is the reason why for example, why their (AS) wealth is not inherited, also why the concept of the &#039;Occult Imam&#039; is superfluous - since we already have a Guide [the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam] who has a connection to this world even while he is in the Barzakh.]]></description>

Didn&#039;t Abu Bakr say in the authentic report: &quot;Whoever worshiped Muhammad, Muhammad is dead but whoever worships Allah, He is eternal never dying.&quot; Therefore, is Abu Bakr a Najdi beast? I doubt it especially since all Sahabah accepted it from him and no one objected, this means they&#039;re all Najdi beasts. Also Allah&#039;s book says {Indeed, you (O Muhammmad) are to die, and indeed, they are to die.} [39:30] is Allah not saying the truth? Finally, if you believe the Prophet (saw) is actually physically alive on this earth, then it is quite rude that he&#039;s being kept prisoner underground, why don&#039;t you go and dig him up?
Please distinguish between a person who died but is alive with his Lord in the heavens and between people who are now living physically in this worldly-life.]]></description>
