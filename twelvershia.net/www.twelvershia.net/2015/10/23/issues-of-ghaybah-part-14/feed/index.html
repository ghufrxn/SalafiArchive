					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2015/10/23/issues-of-ghaybah-part-14/#comment-25843&quot;&gt;Sayyedah&lt;/a&gt;.

Ah, so you&#039;re blaming it on Allah then. According to you, Allah willed for humankind to receive its only guidance from this 12th Imam then Allah at the same time willed for this 12th Imam to disappear without a trace. Gotta say, this makes a lot of sense, very wise indeed. Just as advice for next time you debate, your scholars don&#039;t say that Allah is the cause nor the Imam, they say that it&#039;s the people&#039;s fault for scaring him away.
As for using &quot;Allah&#039;s will&quot; as excuse, that&#039;s not really an explanation because I can claim ANYTHING and say &quot;It&#039;s Allah&#039;s will&quot;. Heck, we Muslims say the Prophet (saw) never appointed anyone after him and this was Allah&#039;s will, so how does that sound?
As for your comparison of this matter and the story of the devil, the devil&#039;s story is a matter of Ghayb which we know not most of it so you can&#039;t be sure that most of what you said didn&#039;t take place. Secondly, the devil is a unique creature with a different nature, bowing for him is unlike bowing for you as a human, we human&#039;s worship by bowing but devils and angels are creatures from fire and light and they don&#039;t physically bow like you do. Thirdly, the scholars of Tafsir differed on the interpretation of that verse and the meaning of prostration within it so refer to their books to know why you can&#039;t use this story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaamu alaykum,
You seem to forget that the Imam did not go into ghaybah of his own will (nauzbillah!) - It was Allah&#039;s (swt) will that he (may Allah&#039;s peace be upon him and may Allah hasten this reappearance) went into ghaybah. 

As for it being illogical that a 5 year old be the leader and all your proofs and logics against it - was it logical that shaytan who&#039;d worshipped Allah (swt) in the most eloquent manner bow to Adam (a.s)? It was Allah&#039;s (swt) will. It was Allah&#039;s (swt) order. Did Allah (swt) give shaytan an explanation for His (swt) divine order? Did Allah (swt) prove to shaytan the superiority of Adam (as)? If yes, please acquaint me with that incident as I am not aware of it. If no, you have your answer as to how and why a 5 year old can be an Imam of the whole humanity. 

May Allah guide me and guide you.
Peace.]]></description>
