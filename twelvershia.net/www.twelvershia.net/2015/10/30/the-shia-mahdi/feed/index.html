					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2015/10/30/the-shia-mahdi/#comment-25929&quot;&gt;Ijtaba&lt;/a&gt;.

As far as Shia sects, many died out and many new ones emerged, just look at a group of them today as they call themselves &quot;Ansar-ul-Mahdi&quot; and believe in a 13th Imam called Ahmad al-Hasan al-Yamani and his supporters are by the thousands in `Iraq and Yemen and a few in Egypt who have sufficient funding that they were able to buy lands and build a base for their Da`wah there. The Waqifi sect of Shia was recently revived by an ex-Twelver and he now has popular writing and a good group of followers. So you have new sects emerging, others dying out and some being revived.

The factors are many as to why a certain belief system would survive and why another would die-out, for instance as far as the legitimate schools of thought such as the Madhab of al-Awza`i or the Madhab of al-Tabari and others schools died out, also major deviant sects and intellectual movements are almost extinct such as the Mu`tazillah. Out of the many reasons:

1- The attractiveness of the teachings: This plays a big role, if you have charismatic speakers and preachers who call people to something that sounds pleasant such as &quot;Rejecting blind Taqleed&quot; (Salafi slogan) or &quot;Love for Ahlul-Bayt&quot; (Shia slogan) or &quot;Removing the disbelieving tyrants&quot; (Khariji slogan) then these groups will attract a good number of laypeople.

2- The activity of the students and followers: If the ideology is written down on paper and transmitted to later generations then it has a great chance of survival. Many schools will die out simply because the learned ones did not author books.

3- The politics: If a government chooses to adopt the Maliki Madhab and then places Maliki Imams and judges in a Hanafi city, then the laypeople in that city will eventually switch to that Madhab out of convenience and there is no harm in that. An extreme example of this would be the forced conversion of Iran by the Safawi government from Shafi`i to Ithna-`Ashari.

4- The funding: This is the life support especially for small deviant sects and minorities, if there were men of power and wealth (such as many Hashemites) then they will be able to spend on their followers and preachers. Israel for instance was only able to survive due to financial support from allied countries and rich successful Jews living abroad.

5- The Wars: Military force could tip the balance in many cases for instance if the Mongols invaded an unfortunate city where a certain sect thrives they will destroy them completely and erase them from existence.

And the list goes on to cover even natural disasters etc...

As for the three major groups of Shia groups today, each one was a majority in their own time, the Zaydis were a major force and had the support of most Shia at some point, they then formed their kingdoms and ruled them and rebelled against their enemies. The Ithna-`Ashari Shia survived not because they were less ridiculous in their beliefs than other deviant sects who are extinct, they just happened to survive since the majority had no choice other than moving on and riding the boat after al-`Askari died, they competed with other sects and outlived them and were then supported by the Buwayhid government and later by the Safawi government. The Isma`ili Shia were also a major force with a great number in their own time, they were supported by the Fatimi govenment of north Africa. Out of all of these the Zaydi Shia have the most sound beliefs and are the closest thing to the traditional Shia of the Salaf, as for the rest whether they be `Ali-Ilahiyyah, `Ithna-`Ashariyyah, `Alawiyyah or whatever one you choose from a long list, they all have very foreign ridiculous beliefs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2015/10/30/the-shia-mahdi/#comment-25929&quot;&gt;Ijtaba&lt;/a&gt;.

Answering the first question: The value of the story, is to inform the Muslim nation that they will pass through great trials and hardships, that their future generation will endure much injustice and oppression but in the end Allah will grant them victory so they must not lose hope and they must continue striving in Allah&#039;s path. When the Prophet (saw) said that at the end of times there shall emerge a guided leader following his example, he was referring to what he had previously told them: &quot;There shall be prophet-hood, then leadership upon the guidance of prophet-hood, then oppressive kingdoms, then it shall return to be upon the guidance of prophet-hood.&quot; As for details about this guided leader, you will find that most of it is fabricated by story tellers and bored desert-Arabs who had nothing better to do. In other words what is known about this guided leader through authentic reports is nothing more than his name, his father&#039;s name, his reign, his generosity and maybe four or five other things. The importance of the &quot;Mahdi&quot; was blown out of proportion at the beginning of the political struggle between banu Umayyah and banu Hashim and then banu al-`Abbas, at that point people strive to fabricate personalities such as the Sufiyani, such as the Mahdi being this or that person, al-Mukhtar claimed Ibn al-Hanafiyyah was the Mahdi and that he was appointed by him, the supporters of al-Nafs-ul-Zakiyyah claimed he was the Mahdi to gather support against banu Umayyah etc... The phenomenon took place because Allah closed the door of prophet-hood by clearly stating that it has ended in the Qur&#039;an, so the deviants looked for alternatives, some claimed Mahdawiyyah, others claimed to be al-Khadir (as), some Shia claimed to be emissaries for the Mahdi or Abwaab, whatever could grant them authority, wealth and influence. In the end, the &quot;Mahdi&quot; is just one from the many signs of the hour and major sign for the coming of `Isa (as) and the end of the world. As for the innovation of the Shia and the belief in &quot;awaiting&quot; for his appearance in sadness and supplicating for Allah to bring him out, this is unheard of in the time of the Prophet (saw). Rasul-Allah (saw) did not teach us to await endlessly for anyone or to cancel the Friday prayer and the struggle in the cause of Allah and dismiss people&#039;s affairs and politics until this man appeared, these are Shia innovations; We were taught to work for our day as if it were the last day we live and do good and benefit humanity and look forward to Allah&#039;s rewards and blessings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

Reading your article few questions came into my mind.

Q1. You said that our Prophet (s.a.w.w) promised about just ruler al-Mehdi (a.s) who would come in end times ruling only for 7 years. What was so important that our Prophet (s.a.w.w) made us aware of this prophecy? That is to say at present Islam has existed more than 1400 years and great leaders have passed such as Hadhrat Abu Bakr (r.a), Hadhrat Umar (r.a) in whose Caliphate Muslims defeated Super Powers of their time, Hadhrat Uthman (r.a) and Imam Ali (a.s) and after him many other Muslim Caliphs, Warriors and Scholars came who benefitted Muslim Ummah with their Knowledge and Bravery. But Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w) singled out Imam Mehdi (a.s) from them and mentioned him by name and his leadership. What was so special about him? Was it because in his leadership Hadhrat Isa (a.s) was to come and mentioning about Imam Mehdi (a.s) and leadership was to help Muslims recognize Hadhrat Isa (a.s) and nothing more i.e. Imam Mehdi (a.s) is ordinary Muslim Imam in whose 7th year of Leadership Hadhrat Isa (a.s) would descend?

Q2. In this article you mentioned throughout Shia history there had been lot of confusion regarding who really was/is Mehdi (a.s) and Shias split in many groups. So could you enlighten me as to how Shia Imami Ithna Ashariya and Shia Ismaili survived and rest died out. About Seveners Shias I am not aware of their existence. They may exist but they are not prominent as 12ers or Ismail is are. About Zaydi Shias there are more like Sunnis. I am particularly interested about 12ers and Ismailis as to how did they survive when according to you they were always surrounded by confusion regarding their Imams (a.s) and Mehdi (a.s)? Specially 12ers as they believed in a so-called myth according to you.12ers group should had easily died out after the death of Imam Hassan Askari (a.s) as lot of confusion arose after the 11th Imam&#039;s death as there was no apparant Imam after him and many people started to leave Shiism. But on the contrary we see 12ers group survive and their numbers increased. Can you explain what factors caused this to happen?]]></description>
