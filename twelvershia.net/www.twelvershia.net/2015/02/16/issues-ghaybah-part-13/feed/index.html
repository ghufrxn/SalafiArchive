					<description><![CDATA[Indeed, shi&#039;ism has no leg to stand upon. 

I wish and hope we keep inviting them to the deen with best manners and sound logic.

So far I have managed to help 2 sisters revert to Islam. Alhamdolillah.

Sisters are more sincere in listening and looking at the evidences.
There were some shi&#039;a males who also accepted the fallacy of imamate having no basis in the Quran. I usually start with that &#039;article of shi&#039;ite faith&#039; and no shi&#039;a can dare respond to the &#039;Quran challenge&#039;. 
Alhamdolillah.]]></description>
