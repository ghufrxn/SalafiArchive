					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2015/02/19/companions-believed-mutah/#comment-29123&quot;&gt;Ijtaba&lt;/a&gt;.

Abrogation will sometimes create confusion. This is common in the books of Tafseer and law. Scholars differed as to whether a ruling was abrogated or not. One doesn&#039;t need to understand how Ibn Abbas formulated his opinion to arrive at the conclusion that he was mistaken. We don&#039;t even need to know what led Ibn Juraij to abandon mut&#039;ah after practicing it for a long time. All we know is that he was mistaken and that he repented from his actions. 

Another possibility is that Ibn Abbas never heard the Prophet - peace be upon him - declaring mut&#039;ah halal or haram, rather, it was second-hand information that he got from another Sahabi, whoever it may be. Decades later, he is introduced to this alternative opinion, and it is not a common thing for one to assume that his early source was wrong after believing in something for so many years. 

As I said, we could keep theorizing about his reasons for a while. Though, in the end, all we will be doing is theorizing. 

Also, please don&#039;t refer to mut&#039;ah as zina. Ibn Abbas didn&#039;t call people to zina, nor did the Prophet - peace be upon him - make zina permissible temporarily. Anyone who says otherwise is plain wrong.]]></description>

Thank you for answering my questions. It is hard to assume that ibn Abbas (r.a) heard Prophet (s) declaring Mutah to be halal and not did not hear the Prophet (s) declaring Mutah to be haram as according to hadiths 3 days after Mutah was declared halal it was clearly forbidden by the Prophet (s) and those Sahabas (r.a) who were engaged in Mutah stopped in engaging it and never did Mutah again.

Similarly there are hadiths which state that Prophet (s) banned Mutah permenantly after allowing Mutah for the second time. 

Even if we assume ibn Abbas (r.a) not to have heard the Prophet (s) declaring Mutah to be haram then still it is somewhat strange on the part of ibn Abbas (r.a) not believing the words of other Sahabis like Imam Ali (a.s), Omar ibn Khattab (r.a), Uthman bin Affan (r.a) and Abdullah ibn Zubayr (r.a) on Mutah being banned by the Prophet (s). Not only did ibn Abbas (r.a) reject their words but was preaching permissibility of Mutah to Muslims. 

I am not questioning ibn Abbas (r.a) actions but I find it quite confusing that a man like ibn Abbas (r,a) would preach to people about a thing declared haram by the Prophet (s) as halal. Its like ibn Abbas (r.a) is calling people towards zina (God Forbid) saying that its halal.]]></description>

Good question. This needs to be examined in a separate article. We have been considering writing an article on the banning of the Mutah of Hajj. Inshallah we will do so in the near future.]]></description>

Wa alaykum alsalam,

It is hard to say what Ibn Abbas had in mind. The only clear matter is that he did not believe that there is clear-cut proof of Mutah being forbidden. Perhaps the most likely scenario is that he heard the Prophet - peace be upon him - declaring that it is halal, but never heard him saying that it was haram. He may have assumed that those that said that it was haram misunderstood the Prophet - peace be upon him - . The possibilities are plenty. As Sunnis, it is not our duty to speculate one&#039;s reasons for their beliefs. Our duty is to simply follow the opinion that has the strongest evidence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Second thing... you stated in your article following about Imran bin Husain:

&quot;A narration that is often used to support the attribution of this view to Imran bin Husain is the narration of Al-Bukhari #4156 where he says that the verse of mutah was revealed in the book of Allah and it was practiced by him with the Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him -, and that nothing forbidding it was revealed until his death, but then a man banned it.
The narration can be found in the chapter of the pilgrimage, which leads us to believe that this is not about the mutah marriage, but the mutah of the pilgrimage.&quot;

The question I want to ask is similar to the first question. Can any person besides the Prophet (s.a.w.w) ban an act which was never forbidden by the Quran and was considered permissible by the Prophet (s.a.w.w)? 

In Surah Tahrim* ... ALLAH (SWT) even did not allow Prophet (s.a.w.w) to prohibit himself a thing which was never forbidden in the Quran so how can non-Prophet ban an act not forbidden by the Al-Quran.

*Surah Tahrim verse 1:
&quot;O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful for you, seeking the approval of your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

I read your article and found it interesting. There are two things which are confusing me. First thing... In your article you stated about ibn Abbas (r.a) :

&quot;The reasoning of Ibn Abbas is a mystery. One can only speculate as to why he stuck to his opinion when the majority of the companions sided with the clear evidences for the prohibition of mutah. Perhaps the most reasonable possibility is that Ibn Abbas accepted that the Prophet – peace be upon him – prohibited mutah, but since he permitted it more than once it meant that it can be permitted during dire conditions. Of course, this ijtihad has no weight since the text from the Prophet – peace be upon him – is clear, and the text always takes precedence over ijtihad.&quot;

I am not knowledgeable about matters concerning Ijtihad... but can a Sahabi do or is allowed to do Ijtihad on matters which have been clear-cut prohibited by the Prophet (s.a.w.w)?

And Mutah is somewhat consider zina by some of the opponents of Mutah... why would Sahabi like Abdullah ibn Abbas (r.a) promote the permissibility of Mutah even in dire conditions among the followers of Islam?

Some weak and evil minded people could use this reasoning and do rape, incest or homosexual wicked act by stating that there were in situation where there was no woman with whom they could have legal halal relationship. There is possibility of such people existing as it is said that in the end of times people would interpret Al-Quran according to their desires rather than following teachings of Al-Quran.]]></description>
