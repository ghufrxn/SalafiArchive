Salam `Aleykum,

Dear sister, you can register on our forum &quot;forum.twelvershia.net&quot; where a group of good people will help you with advice and suggestions. A girl from my family (also Shafi`i) had a Shia fiancee, she broke it off since she found out he was already doing Mut`ah with a bunch of other girls during their engagement. My advice is to try and convince him to leave Tashayyu`, the Ja`fari faith is very problematic and it will cause you headaches in the future if he doesn&#039;t abandon it altogether and embrace Qur&#039;an and Sunnah. We know another girl who was in love with a Shia, all her friends advised her to stay away from him, she said &quot;It&#039;s okay he&#039;s moderate&quot; after she married him he became an extreme Shia which ended up in a disaster for her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mashallah, when I was shia I knew a few religious Shias who did mutah. It didn&#039;t end well with one of them (don&#039;t know about others), because of him bringing his &#039;wife&#039; (a bad influence) to the home his younger sisters stopped wearing Hijab and went farther from their shia faith I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s happened to them now. :(]]></description>
