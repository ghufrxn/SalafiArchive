					<description><![CDATA[Alhamdulillah I have read your translation of Minal Qalb Ilal Qabl, that is From heart to the heart,.. Alhamdulillah I have printed and gave a free copy to my friends and colleagues... It will be of great importance if the book of Usman Alkhamis &quot;&quot; HUQBATUN MINAT TAARIKH &quot;&quot; will be translated for us into ENGLISH... There many of our friends here in Nigeria that we want them to have access to that book to have true understanding of history of Islam especially about the calamities that befall ISLAM during the life of SAHABA, but the major problem is that they can&#039;t understand Arabic... Many of the books that black mail the history of those Great Companions like THEN I WAS GUIDED, TO BE WITH THE TRUTHFUL, THE RIGHT PATH written by SHI&#039;A scholars were given to our friends here and it&#039;s causing a great problem now... Please and please we are In a dare need of English translation of HIQBATUM MINAT TAARIKH... Thank you,, looking forward to hearing from you soon...]]></description>
