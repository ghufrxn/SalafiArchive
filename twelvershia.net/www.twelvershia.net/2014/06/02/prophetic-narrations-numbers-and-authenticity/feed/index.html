					<description><![CDATA[religion for Iranian is not an act of worship it is an act of identity and nationalism. you can give them all the reason and evidence still they don&#039;t believe you and they will curse the companions more and more and curse Aisha (ra). and those who follow them . after living six years in Tehran i found out that if someone asked about my religion just smile and not get sucked into there pitiful arguments. because they curse the companions and ahhle sunnah . corruption is in all time high in iran . and most of the people know about economical corruption and still choose to not rise their vice because they&#039;re indoctrinated by a religion that teaches hate and therefore the people are isolated from Muslims and teaching of our prophet(peace be upon him )and the whole world. Iranian society has never been so divided. some who receive monthly salary from iranian government always show up for demonstration and mischief and betrayal . and use their false religion to justify their wrong doings . most of shias in iran do not believe in islam but when we talk about islam they assume we talk about arab superiority and because im not an arab they call me ISIS or vahabi or terrorist .
  i want to thank you anyway for spreading the knowledge . one day when i see someone whose really interested in islam not shiaism i will use your arguments to guide him . thank you so much for your beautiful website may allah reward you .]]></description>
