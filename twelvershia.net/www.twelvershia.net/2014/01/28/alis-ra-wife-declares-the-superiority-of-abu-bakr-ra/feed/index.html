I am from a pure sunni family. Since you are from Pakistan you must be aware of the fact how Zarb e Azab resulted in martyrdom of above 150 children in APS Peshawar. Imam Ali bin Abu Talib RA was of the view that if he immediately avenges the death of hazrat Usman RA, it would have led to chaotic condition in the empire. So it was the necessity of the hour first to establish peace in empire and then go for revenge. Imam Ali was right in his stance and ijitahad of Hazrat Ameer E Muawiyah RA was wrong. As far as Aisha RA is concerned, again Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Aisha both were right and the situation was pacified but the war started due to hypocrites.   Secondly it comes in a hadith that we should not discuss matters of contradiction. But please brother u have come to the right path by realizing the importance of the Sahaba. Verily Abu Bakar RA had no parallel followed by Umar RA, Uthman RA and then Ali RA after which there is no discrimination. The thing is speaking even a single word againt Ali Mawla RA also can disqualify us from being a Muslim. Umar RA used to say that in our time we used to judge hypocrisy of people due to hatred towards Ali RA. So with out Abu Bakar RA u cant be a muslim neither without Mawla Ali RA.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being too neutral in my prospective I&#039;m from a shia family and we live in Pakistan I just 18 years old I have been educated Shariuah for two years in shia religious school then I left for Pakistan I joined a well known Sunni religious school in Raiwiand (Tabligi Jammat) and studied there for next three years.
I have degrees from both Shia and Sunni Schools
my prospective is &quot;it is true that most of us shai tries to exaggerate charges against Hazrat Uthman ibn Affan (R.A) actually if we study books critically of both Sunni and Shia we will find most the references that shia got are weak at sandah with respect that of Sunni. There are clear evidence that Islamic State was not in complete control of Uthman (R.A) but there is no rule in Shariuah that allows to ask him to leave his place. He could only be asked to look at the cases and go for Justice. Aisha (R.A) was not against Uthman (R.A) at all. Yes it is true that she was critical about the acts of Marwan and few other government officials. She asked Uthman (R.A) in prophets Mosque clearly for justice and made him realize he was not doing great job. Letters that are usually referred to her actually did not belong to her because if we look at Aisha (R.A) we shall find that she was too brave and she liked to speak on face even she liked to speak bravely in front of Muhammad (P.B.U.H). There is no clear evidence has been found that can show even a single letter was written by Her. As long as Muhammad bin Abu Bakar is concerned one of our brothers wrote in a early reply that we cannot say anything about him because he was son of Hazrat Abu Bakar (R.A). My brother you are wrong yes he was son of a great man but blood has nothing to do with acts and reputation according to Quran and Sunnah of Muhammad (P.B.U.H). He was a young man that the time of that worst event. He was misguided and letter about which he claimed to find was never shown to public in Medinah. When he had recognized the writing of Marwan he should had left with his men but he did&#039;t and attacked house of Uthman (R.A). Yes it is true he did not killed Uthman (R.A) but left at very moment and Allah knows best about his Imaan. One thing that I use to say a few years before that Muhammad bin Abu Bakar was great because he fought for Ali (R.A) is actually wrong. No matter how great and pious Hazrat Ali (R.A) was but he was a human and only Prophets are those creatures of Allah subhana-talha that never go for mistake. Every other creature even if he was Ali (R.A) can commit mistake. I have quires in my mind when Ali (R.A) knew that who started armed rebellion against Uthman (R.A) why he kept them in his army and in his ranks when he got enough power to catch them and treat them according to Islamic law.If claim of Ammer Mawiuah (R.A) was not right that he was asking Ali (R.A) to give him killers of Uthman (R.A) then why Ali (R.A) didn&#039;t punish them even when he had power to punish. Ali (R.A) did same as Uthman (R.A) did but in different manner we provided only those people with governing posts and power who served him personally. Note that I&#039;m not asserting or accusing I&#039;m asking questions.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, may Allah reward the team of twelvershia.net, ameen!

The irony is that many Shias actually boast around saying that Muhammad bin Abi Bakr was a true Sahabi (of course only because he was a good Sahabi to Ali and not because of our Prophet!!!), many of them even use the username &#039;Muhammad Bin Abi Bakr&#039; on forums and social media, yet what the dumb Shias don&#039;t know is:

1. Acc. to the majority opinion he was not a Sahabi (he was too little and never interacted with the Prophet peace be upon him).

2. He was a Nasibi acc. to Shia beliefs because although he suported Ali, yet he loved Abu Bakr and believed (just as the absolute majority of the Ummah including Ali and the major Bani Hashim personalities) that no one is superior than Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Quhafa.

It&#039;s a shame that the likes of Yasser al-Habib and other Shia scholars chose to go for fabrications (in Shia and Sunni books) such as narrations where Muhammad Bin Abi Bakr gave allegiance to Ali with the condition to curse Abu Bakr (this is what Yasser al-Habib said in one of his lectures I listened to)!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is part of the miraculous taqiyya of the Imams. 
Their taqiyya was so good, even their own families were fooled, not to mention virtually all the Muslims.
The only way to penetrate behind the veil of taqiyya is to ask the turbaned clerics in places like Qum what the Imams really meant. *Those guys* can tell you for sure.]]></description>
