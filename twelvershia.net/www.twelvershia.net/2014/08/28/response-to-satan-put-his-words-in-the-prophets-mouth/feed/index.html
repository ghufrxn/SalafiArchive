Dear Jarod,

It is not academic to give the tall man a name simply because it provides more details to the story.

In Islam, the strengths of each narration is determined separately, and only the narrations that are of a certain level will be accepted. It was very common for fabricators to invent tales that surround factual events. That being the case, one should be extra careful with detailed narrations that revolved around acceptable facts, especially when the details come from questionable sources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jest like in any religion there will be times when you compare scriptures or surahs or hadiths together that some will controdict itself, or at least give more then one path or story about things.
So I feel that you can use both those hadiths about the tall man, and usually you would go with more of the story that give more info and names.all this disputeing does is prove that there is what muslims say there isnt with quran and sunnah, and gives non muslims reasons not to believe.]]></description>
