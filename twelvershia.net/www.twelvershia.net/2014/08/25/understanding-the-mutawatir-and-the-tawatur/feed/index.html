Brother Shadi, 

The Mu&#039;atazili conditions that you have mentioned at the end of your comment are problematic as well. As you are aware, narrations of different schools do exist in the books of opposing sects. I am sure you are aware of the Shi&#039;ee narrations in the Sunni library. 

We&#039;re glad you continue to visit us and we are patiently awaiting your arrival to the dark side. 

Eidkum mubarak.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The mutazila didn&#039;t have their own hadith collection so they didn&#039;t fabricate as they would have nothing to fabricate. The Mutazila were mostly hanafis, including the grandson of Abu Hanifa who believed in the creation of the Qur&#039;an, his name is isma3il ibn hamad ibn nu3man. Furthermore I agree with you that the conditions of something falling in the category of tawatur with just these conditions as the shii scholar mentioned is not strong evidence, this was also my exact opinion even before studying the subject. Beliefs can be spread even without the people holding these beliefs meeting each other due to an event or a debate taking place with in the ummah. However in terms of the conditions for the mutazila, their conditions were not just a large number but also the hadith must use the same wording (not just tawatur of meaning), reported by different schools of thoughts, and reported in various lands all at the same time, this brings absolute certainty to them.]]></description>
