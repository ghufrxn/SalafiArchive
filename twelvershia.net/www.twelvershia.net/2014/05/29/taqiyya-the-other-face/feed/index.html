We didn&#039;t use the expression &quot;Shia Madhab&quot; as opposed to Shafi`i, Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki Madhab. Rather we used it in its linguistic meaning, as in &quot;The way of the Shia&quot;, this &quot;way&quot; could be complete and utter deviance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do you consider Shia as a madhab? In your conclusion, you said &#039;“Taqiyya” as a name is shared by both the Sunni and Shi`ee Madhab&#039;. Shi&#039;aism has a totally different dogmas and doctrines as compared to Islam therefore it cannot be considered as madhab of Islam. The madhaheb of Shafiee, Hanbali, Maliki and Hanafi do not consider cursing Abu Bakr r.a., Umar r.a., Aisha r.a. and Hafsah r.a. as a way to Jannah. Nor do these madhaheb consider all Sahabas as apostates and liars nor do they consider the Quran as corrupted and not preserved nor do they consider eating dung and drinking urine of Imams as a ticket to Jannah nor do they modify the 5 Pillars of Islam and include Imamah as one of the 5 pillars, do they? The proper term to use when referring to Shia is DEVIANT CULT, never a madhab of Islam. Kindly modify your article. Thanks and regards...]]></description>
