Many of your scholars believe it&#039;s corrupted, and your other scholars still consider them Shia and believers, therefore what he just said about the Shia belief in the Qur&#039;an is fairly accurate although it cannot be generalized.]]></description>

Have you lost it? Couldn&#039;t hope for a more ignorant reply on an ignorant piece of writing. You have been completely brainwashed by the people close to you. It can be concluded from the fact that you believe we shias do not believe in Quran. We believe in The holy book more than you. Where does any shia say that is Islam is not complete? Stop with your ignorant thoughts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do not  converse with shias . Because shia can &#039;t be satisfied by true arguments and evidance ... all shias are ignoring the facts of Quran  and thus an ignorant  can&#039;t be satisfied . If they assumes theirself muslim they should have to bleive in Quran and sunnah. Quran can prov the facts of  caliph Abu bakr Usman and Umer so  if any shiite cinsiders himself to be a muslim they shold have to beleive in Quran .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shia are not muslims . Because the do not beleive in Quran. And   the Islam is completed  no one will come after Hazrat muhmmad S.A.W  so then why the 12th imam of shia will come in future ?  The  Islam is completed by the Hazrat muhammad s.a.w so there is nothing in short or need for someone else like 12th imam.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Comment: Thus we find that Ahlelbayt(ra) named their children “Abubakr” due to their immense love for “Abubakr Siddiq(ra)”. It should be noted that Abubakr was the not the real name of Abubakr Siddiq(ra), it was his nick name. His real name was “Abdullah” as stated by Imam Nawawi in his Tahdheeb. And we don’t find any other companion of Prophet(saw) who shared the nick name Abubakr, and this wasn’t even a common kuniya during the lifetime of Abubakr(ra). Thus we ask the unbiased Shias to ponder over the fact that why did so many members of Ahlelbayt gave this name to their Children? Which Abubakr was so virtues that it compelled Ahlelbayt to name their children Abubakr? Can the Shia bring forth another Abubakr(ra) other than Abubakr Siddiq(ra) who had countless virtues? Some deceptive Shias have tried to portray the name “Abubakr” was a very common name in Arabia and they provided few names to support this deceit. But the fact is that none of these men who had the name “Abubakr” were born before Ali(ra) named his son Abubakr. So the question still remains that who was that personality with the name Abubakr, who had so many virtues that Ahlelbayt named their children on his name? Please refer this article which refutes the Shia arguments regarding the issue of Ali(ra) naming his son Abubakr.{Response to: The Names of Imam Ali (as)’s Sons} [&#8230;]]]></description>
