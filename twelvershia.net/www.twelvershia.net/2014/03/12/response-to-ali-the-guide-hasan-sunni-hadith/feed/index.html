					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2014/03/12/response-to-ali-the-guide-hasan-sunni-hadith/#comment-18559&quot;&gt;Yousif&lt;/a&gt;.

Musnad Ahmad? Did you know that in Musnad Ahmad it says: &quot;The warner and the guide is a man from Banu Hashim&quot;? The narration doesn&#039;t mention `Ali. There is no mention of the above text in Musnad Ahmad (And it&#039;s weak either way).

Secondly, you wrote Khasa&#039;is of al-Nasa&#039;ee and I never found it there.

Thirdly, you wrote &quot;Kenz Al-Oman&quot; It&#039;s called Kanz-ul-`Ummal, which means you never even opened this book since you don&#039;t know its title, which means you copied it from somewhere else. FYI, this book has no chains so everything in it is not acceptable.

Fourthly, ibn al-Maghazili&#039;s Manaqib contains the worst quality of Hadith, the author collected everything he could get his hands on without verifying its authenticity. I also couldn&#039;t find this narration in the page you specified.

These sources aside, this narration is found elsewhere and its chain is weak.]]></description>
