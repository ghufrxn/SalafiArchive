al-Hakim&#039;s grading in al-Mustadrak is very unreliable, he was an old man when he wrote it so he included loads of weak narrations, even fabricated like this one.

The Hadith doesn&#039;t begin with Suffiyan al-Thawri. It begins with Ahmad bin `Abdullah bin Yazid al-Harrani who narrates it from `Abdul-Razzaq who then narrates it from Suffiyan al-Thawri.

So the first narrator, Ahmad al-Harrani, al-Dhahabi refers to him as &quot;Dajjal Kazzab&quot;, meaning &quot;great liar&quot;. So whoever gave you what you wrote above, tricked you.]]></description>
