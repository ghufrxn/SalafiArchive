<p style="text-align: justify;">The question of who holds onto the Thaqalayn is a common one that is often brought up in Sunni-Shia polemics. Even though there is much to say about the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/10/26/hadith-of-thaqalayn/">exact wording</a> of the narration, this article sheds light on the fact that it is Ahl Al-Sunnah that hold onto the Thaqalayn, the Qur’an and Ahl Al-Bayt, and not the Shias.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Holding onto the Qur’an</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the untrained eye, it may seem that both sects do in some manner or form hold onto the Qur’an. Shias, in order to suggest that Sunnis do not hold onto the Qur’an, attempt to provide specific verses, like the verse of ablution (which has been <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/10/16/washing-of-the-feet-in-wudu-answering-shii-contentions-part-1/">explained here</a>), to suggest that they are the orthodox “holders” of the Qur’an. However, this form of nit-picking does not suffice for one to make such a claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/القرآن.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4029 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/القرآن-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Shias cannot say that “the Sunnis do not hold onto the Qur’an at all,” because that statement would simply be untrue and unrealistic. However, the claim that Shias do not hold onto the Qur’an is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one that can be made and proven</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the majority of the Muslim world recites the Qur’an in the recitation of Hafs from Asim. In Morocco and Mauritania, Muslims recite in the recitation of Nafi’, while Muslims in Sudan recite the Qur’an in the recitation of Abu Amr bin Al-&#8216;Alaa&#8217;. Sunnis believe that these recitations were all taught by the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most Shias are simply not aware that these recitations of the Qur’an are not endorsed by their Imams. By returning to their authentic sayings, we find the Imam saying, “The Qur’an is one and it is from the One, and these difference are from the recitors.” 2/348-349 In other words, these recitations, although permitted by the Imams, are <strong>not</strong> considered legitimate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Top Shia scholars, in the present and the past, have echoed these feelings, claiming that the current recitation that is adopted by all Shias today, the recitation of Hafs from Asim, is false. Al-Tusi in Tahtheeb Al-Ahkam 1/53, for example, states that the common recitation of the verse of ablution is <strong>not permissible</strong>. <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/09/19/response-to-the-collection-and-preservation-of-the-quran/">Al-Khoei</a>, too, has severely criticized Hafs from Asim, the main recitors of the recitation relied upon by Shias. He also goes as far to say that one cannot take rulings from these recitations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, it becomes undeniable that Shias do not hold onto the greater of the two-weighty things (Thaqalayn).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Holding onto Ahl Al-Bayt</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of holding onto Ahl Al-Bayt may seem synonymous with Shiasm, yet, the claim sometimes seems like nothing more than a marketing gimmick to reel Sunnis in. According to the Shia understanding of the narration, one is supposed to hold onto the Twelve Imams from Ahl Al-Bayt. However, there is nothing in the narration that limits it to those Twelve. If that was the intended purpose of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , he would have said, “Hold onto the Imams from Ahl Al-Albayt,” or perhaps, &#8220;hold onto the twelve from my Ahl Al-Bayt,&#8221; instead. Besides, it is not possible for one to follow the Twelve Imams due to their countless contradictions due to <em><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/taqiyya-the-other-face/">taqiyyah</a>. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be known that Ahl Al-Sunnah do not believe that notable scholars like Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq ever practiced <em>taqiyyah</em>, and that they were god-fearing men that would rather die before teaching their followers false rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that we are led to believe that the proper understanding of the narration is to hold onto Ahl Al-Bayt as a whole, instead of limiting Ahl Al-Bayt to a small group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should come as no surprise that the Sunnis abide by this teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only do Sunnis take knowledge from Ali bin Abi Talib, Al-Hassan, Al-Hussain, Zain Al-Abideen, Al-Baqir, Al-Sadiq, Al-Kathim, etc, but they took knowledge from<strong> all the scholars of Ahl Al-Bayt.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hakim Al-Nisapuri (Ma’rifat Uloom Al-Hadith p. 221) said, “There are authentic narrations from the children of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , from Fatima, Al-Hassan, Al-Husain, Al-Hassan bin Al-Hassan bin Ali, Abdullah, Hassan, Ali, and Zayd bin Al-Hassan bin Al-Husain bin Ali, Amr bin Al-Hassan bin Ali, Muhammad bin Amr bin Hassan bin Ali, Al-Hassan bin Zayd bin Hassan bin Ali, Musa bin Abdullah bin Al-Hassan bin Al-Hassan, Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Al-Hassan bin Al-Hassan bin Ali, Ali bin al Husain bin Ali, Fatima bint Al-Husain bin Ali, Muhammad, Abdullah, Zayd, Omar, and Al-Husain bin Ali bin Al-Husain, Jafar bin Muhammad bin Ali, and Al-Hussein bin Zayd bin Ali are those that have authentic narrations, and we have over <strong>two hundred </strong>narrators from Ahl Al-Bayt both men and women.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/اعلام.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4028 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/اعلام-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Sunnis were also known to have taken knowledge from the scholars of Ahl Al-Bayt that happened to be scholars from the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/02/hanafi-scholars-from-ahlul-bayt/">Hanafi</a>  (108 scholars), Maliki (168 scholars), Shafi’ee (200 scholars), and Hanbali (143 scholars) schools of <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note: </strong>The full list and biographies of these scholars can be obtained in the following works: A’alam Al-Hanafiyyah min Ahl Al-Bayt by Wa’el bin Mohammad Al-Hanbali, A’alam Al-Malikiyya min Ahl Al-Bayt by Rizq Mohammad Abdul-Haleem, A’alam Al-Shafi’eeya min Ahl Al-Bayt by Bassam Abdul-Kareem Al-Hamzawi, and A’alam Al-Hanabila min Ahl Al-Bayt by Mohammad Yusuf Al-Muzaini.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In total, Ahl Al-Sunnah took knowledge from over <strong>eight-hundred­</strong> members of Ahl Al-Bayt.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no doubt in mind that Shias cannot claim to hold onto the Qur’an since the orthodox view is the rejection of the recitations. They have also misinterpreted the act of “holding onto Ahl Al-Bayt” as well by limiting the members of Ahl Al-Bayt to twelve.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Calamity of Thursday (Intentions of the Companions)</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following article is a continuation of our previous article on the Calamity of Thursday (Raziyyat Al-Khamees) in which we focused on the content of the will of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . In this article, we will be focusing on the intentions of the Companions and their hesitation. Shias often claim that the Companions intended to prevent the Prophet – peace be upon him – from appointing Ali, and thus, caused the nation to fall into misguidance. The narration is also used to suggest that the Companions disbelieved by accusing the Prophet – peace be upon him – of losing his mind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">These arguments are made with little understanding of the context as we shall soon see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Note:</strong> We would like readers to keep in mind that we have established in the previous article that the content of the will was unknown to the Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas narrated:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was `Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; said, &#8220;Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; `Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarreled. Some said &#8220;Go near so that the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while the others said as `Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211;  said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4432)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this topic, we will be taking a deep look at the following aspects and sections of the “Calamity of Thursday”:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He is Delirious!” </strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Book of Allah is Sufficient”</strong></span></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to Sunnis?</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to the Shias?</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“He is Delirious!” </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps the most common claim that Shias raise is that Omar accused the Prophet – peace be upon him – of being delirious. First of all, we do not find this statement being attributed to Omar in any of the narrations. The narration does not determine who made this statement, but only states that some of the Companions did. Moreover, the terms used differ in the narrations. In some narrations, we find them saying, “The Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him &#8211;  is delirious.” (Al-Bukhari #3053), though in most of the narrations, we find it posed as a question, in which they ask, “Is he delirious?” (Al-Bukhari #3168, #4431, and Muslims #1637).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though in the coming centuries it has become accepted among the scholars that it is impossible for the Prophet – peace be upon him – to become delirious, it was not a view that had achieved consensus during the time of the Companions, for they were not exposed to these philosophical discussions. Rather, they understood the religion as it was presented to them and did not partake in such discussions seeing as to how it was unnecessary when they had a prophet from Allah among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In other words, those that have uttered those words had no issue with reconciling the idea that the Prophet – peace be upon him – can be delirious, without it contradicting his status as a prophet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some Shias like to claim that holding such a view is disbelief. We would like them to provide their proof that one who testifies that “there is no god but Allah and Mohammad is His Messenger” is a disbeliever if they believe in the <strong>possibility</strong> of a prophet becoming delirious when suffering from an extreme ailment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is also important to keep in mind that the specifics of the “Calamity of Thursday” incident have not been narrated in a detailed manner. At face value, one would make the assumption that the statement, “Is he delirious?” was uttered at the mere suggestion of the writing of a will. An assumption like this is due to a shallow reading. The hesitation of the Companions was due to their uncertainty of what the Prophet – peace be upon him – was intending to say due to his fatigue. Readers with relatives that have suffered from terminal illnesses will be able to relate to this. If we keep in mind that the Prophet – peace be upon him – was suffering twice as much as the common man (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5648 and Saheeh Muslim #2571), it is understandable how his fatigue would affect his speech and how that would cause confusion to the Companions. This is the observation of Omar as well who clearly stated that “the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – pain has overtaken him.” Ibn Abbas himself says in the beginning of the narration that this event took place when the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – pain and suffering had increased. (Al-Bukhari #114)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Book of Allah is Sufficient”</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps one of the more confusing statements that were uttered in the gathering was the statement of Omar, “The Book of Allah is sufficient for us.” So, why did Omar say this? The most obvious answer is that it is because this is what the Prophet – peace be upon him – said several weeks ago during the pilgrimage. Jabir narrated (Saheeh Muslim #1218), “You shall not go astray if you hold onto what I have left among you: The Book of Allah.” As we can see, the wordings are extremely similar, and thus, Omar knew that his answer was correct.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, we do not believe that this was what the Prophet – peace be upon him – intended to dictate, for he had already stated this in front of a hundred thousand pilgrims a few weeks before. There was no need to have it written down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">So even though we do believe that Omar’s answer was the correct one, we do believe that his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other assumption</span> was incorrect, which was that the Prophet – peace be upon him – would get better, which leads us to our next point.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Omar’s Mistake</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A point that many people overlook is that Omar had no idea that the Prophet – peace be upon him – was going to pass away. The most obvious evidence for this is his extreme denial upon hearing the news. He shouted, “By Allah, the Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him – did not die!” (Al-Bukhari #3667)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only did Omar have no idea, but Ali was oblivious as well (Al-Bukhari #4447):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">`Ali bin Abi Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. `Ali)! How is the health of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  this morning?&#8221; `Ali replied, <strong>&#8220;He has recovered with the Grace of Allah.&#8221;</strong> `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him, &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the above in mind, we come to the conclusion that those that opposed the writing of the will did not do so because they had an issue with the content, but rather, had an issue with the circumstances. In other words, they would have been all for the writing of the will as soon as the Prophet – peace be upon him – got better. Little did they know that his health would not improve and that he would pass away a few days later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Omar’s mistake was not that he believed that “the Qur’an is sufficient,” since those are the words of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . Omar’s mistake is that he believed that the Prophet – peace be upon him – would dictate the teachings after he got better.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to Sunnis?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">No. According to the Sunni view, the Muslims did not go astray. The Prophet – peace be upon him – was referring to the Muslims in a general sense, and the majority of the Muslims, from his time to modern times, are upon the correct path.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Muslims held onto the Book of Allah, which kept them on the right path. As we have mentioned above, the Prophet – peace be upon him – himself said that holding onto it will cause one to not go astray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As for the will, even though it wasn’t written, the majority of the Muslims followed it as we have pointed out in our previous article on the subject of the “Calamity of Thursday.”</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to the Shias?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes. According to the Shia view, the majority of Muslims went astray because the Prophet – peace be upon him – was not “allowed” to write his will. The actions of a small group of people that could barely fit into his humble abode, caused the whole Islamic system to collapse, since Ali’s name couldn’t be written down on paper, even though a public declaration of his appointment allegedly took place a few weeks ago in front of ten thousand. That is the Shia view.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Like in our previous article, the misconceptions that surround the topic are due to the preconceptions of Shias, may Allah guide them. The preconceptions in the “Calamity of Thursday” event are that the Companions knew the content of the will, as we have debunked in the previous article, and that they purposefully attempted to neutralize the attempt to write it down. By the grace of Allah, we have proven that both preconceptions are baseless in the light of the historical context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like to remind readers again that the event cannot be found in authentic Shia literature, yet, their bias allows them to accept this as an absolute historical fact because it appeals to their views.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Calamity of Thursday (Content of the Will)</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this two part article, we will be taking a look at one of the most common allegations brought up by Shias in polemical discussions. The “Calamity of Thursday” (Raziyyat Al-Khamees), referred to by many as the Pen and Paper incident, has been abused as the bread and butter of such discussions for a long time. In this portion of the article, we will be examining the question of the content of the will. In the next section, we will be looking into the actions of the Companions on that day and what their actions entail. Even though the two arguments stem from one hadith, we have chosen to divide our response into two sections since these are two separate lines of argumentation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The text of the narration:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas narrated:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was `Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; said, &#8220;Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; `Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarreled. Some said &#8220;Go near so that the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while the others said as `Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211;  said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4432)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this topic, we will be taking a deep look at the following aspects and sections of the “Calamity of Thursday”:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assumptions Regarding the Will</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Were the Companions Aware of a Clear Appointment for Ali?</strong></span></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sunni Perspective of the Will’s Content</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assumptions Regarding the Will</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main issue with the Shia perspective of the Calamity of Thursday hadith is the sheer amount of baseless speculation. According to the Shia narrative, two main unfounded assumptions are made. The first is that the Prophet – peace be upon him – wanted to appoint Ali as his successor. The second is that the Companions knew of the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – intentions. However, nowhere in the narration do we find clear cut evidences that this was the case. The assumptions are based on Shia preconceptions and the hesitation of the Companions in writing the will.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Were the Companions Aware of a Clear Appointment for Ali?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically, Hadith Al-Ghadeer is perhaps the greatest evidence that both assumptions are flawed. Firstly, if Hadith Al-Ghadeer was indeed an appointment of Ali, then there is no reason to even write a will. <strong>Surely, a statement of appointment by the Prophet – peace be upon him – in front of over ten thousand of his Companions, has much more weight than a written document.</strong> As we all know, documents can be forged, while the testimony of ten thousand eye-witnesses cannot be rejected under any circumstances. It makes absolutely no sense to put it in writing when such an appointment has already been established. It makes even less sense to assume that the Companions assumed that the will was about the appointment of Ali, since such an appointment was allegedly already made publicly, as per the Shia claim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The only way to even argue that the Calamity of Thursday was about the appointment of Ali is by suggesting that the Companions did not understand the event at Al-Ghadeer to be an appointment, which is the Sunni point of view.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ibn Abbas’ Comments on the Appointment</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is furthermore ironic that the very person that has narrated this narration is completely oblivious to the preconceptions and claims of the Shias. As it is historically recorded, Ibn Abbas was one of Ali’s closest allies. Not only did Ali have him lead battalions during wars, but he also had him in charge of Basra and the pilgrimage in the year 37 AH. (See Tareekh Khalifa bin Khayyat for example) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas, in the very narration that is quoted above, is describing the misfortune of the “Calamity of Thursday” since he does not know what the Prophet – peace be upon him – wanted to dictate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ibn Abbas does narrate some of the other orders that the Prophet – peace be upon him – made before his death (Saheeh Muslim #1637). These do not include anything about an appointment of Ali. It is also clear from Ibn Abbas’ reactions that what the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; wanted to be written down was different from the other orders that Ibn Abbas narrated:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with them.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">If Ibn Abbas knew of the Prophet’s – peace be upon him &#8211; intentions he would not have been saddened, nor would he have continuously display his allegiance to Abu Bakr and Omar who allegedly robbed Ali of his position.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also narrates as we find in Saheeh Al-Bukhari (#4447):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">`Ali bin Abi Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. `Ali)! How is the health of Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him –  this morning?&#8221; `Ali replied, <strong>&#8220;He has recovered with the Grace of Allah.&#8221;</strong> `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him, &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him – and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new ruler to take care of us.&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him – for it.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The above narration does not only display that Ibn Abbas was oblivious to what the Prophet – peace be upon him – intended in his will, but that Ali and Al-Abbas were also oblivious.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Sunni Perspective of the Will’s Content</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sunnis do not hold the position that the writing of the will was an obligation upon the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . If it were an obligation, the Prophet – peace be upon him – would have written the will whether the Companions liked it or not. He wouldn’t have punished the whole Ummah for the mistakes of a few men. Even in the hadith of Ibn Abbas, only a group of the Companions acted in this manner, while the rest wanted the will to be written down immediately.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, the Prophet – peace be upon him – told the Companions to leave on Thursday, but passed away four days later on Monday (Al-Bukhari #1205). He had ample time to write the will. In that time, he instead told the Muslims to give gifts to foreign delegations and to remove the pagans from the peninsula, as per the hadith of Ibn Abbas that we have previously quoted. In another hadith, as per the narration of Abdullah bin Abi Awfa, he orders the Muslims to hold onto the book of Allah (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2740). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though we are certain that no will was written, we do find in Saheeh Muslim #2387 a narration that gives us an idea of what he – peace be upon him – intended to write:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger – peace be upon him &#8211; in his (last) illness asked me to call Abu Bakr, her father, and her brother too, so that he might write a document, for he feared that someone else might be desirous (of succeeding him) and that some claimant may say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I have better claim to it, whereas Allah and the Faithful do not substantiate the claim of anyone but that of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the likely Shia argument that A’isha fabricated this report, we can only appeal to those of sound minds by pointing out that A’isha denied that the Prophet – peace be upon him – didn’t appoint anyone in the end (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2741). She did not believe that he &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; appointed Ali or Abu Bakr.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We would like readers to also be aware that the <strong>Calamity of Thursday event is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not authentic</span> in Shia sources</strong>, however, Shias accept it simply because it supports their views. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The average Shias will of course reject our evidences and narrations as Sunni propaganda. However, we would like to remind them that we are bound by our sources in the same way that they are bound by their sources. Sunnis cannot simply accept portions of narrations while ignoring the complete historical context through other narrations. Remember, the Sunni view is based on an understanding of the complete picture through the authentic sources. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For those curious as to why the Sunnis don’t reject their own hadith compilations in their first place and adhere to the Shia narrative, we would like to redirect readers to <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/06/02/shia-hadith-vs-sunni-hadith/">our articles on the subject.</a></span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Examining Nahj Al-Balagha and the Eloquence of Ali</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long before anyone even heard of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/12/12/nahjul-balagha-contradicts-shia-teachings/" rel="external nofollow">Nahjul Balagha</a>, it was eloquence of the Qur’an has always been a testimony for the authenticity of the message of Islam. As soon as the Qur’an was made public, it won the hearts of men and women, while simultaneously filling the souls of the arrogant with fear and discomfort. Their dreams, hopes, and economy were laid to waste by words that are neither poetry nor prose. Mohammad &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; exclaimed that these are the words of the Creator… and his message was accepted by the masses ever since.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no surprise that even we in today’s standards are in awe of Allah’s words. The unattainable eloquence of the text serves as a reminder of the temporal world that we live in, and that to Him we return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article though, is not about the eloquence of Allah, but of the eloquence of Ali, for Shias claim that he was so eloquent that his words too pierced the hearts of the masses and pulled in converts to Islam. However, they have not stopped at that, but rather, they have exaggerated his eloquence and have claimed that it is “above the speech of the creation” (Ma Huwa Nahj Al-Balagha p.5 by Al-Shihristani) and that his speech is the “brother of the Qur’an.” (See Al-Tharee’a by Agha Buzurk 14/111) It goes without saying that such statements put him above the rest of the Sahaba, Abu Bakr included.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked for proof of this, Shias usually provide two evidences. They would either provide the Sunni with a copy of Nahj Al-Balagha (The Peak of Eloquence) or they would present the Sunni with a sermon by Ali that does not contain any dots.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who Collected Nahj Al-Balagha?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though it is popular opinion today that Shias believe that Nahj Al-Balagha was collected by Al-Shareef Al-Murtadha, we find that the earliest Shia scholar held the view that it was in fact penned by his brother Al-Shareef Al-Radhi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This view is held by the top Rijali scholars like Al-Najashi (p. 398) and Muntajab Al-Deen (p. 176). Furthermore, Al-Radhi himself states that he is the author of Nahj Al-Balagha. See Masadir Nahj Al-Balagha 1/103-111.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed states in the introduction of his famed exegesis that Al-Radhi was indeed the compiler.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nahj Al-Balagha: Authorship and Eloquence</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nahj Al-Balagha is a collection of sermons and sayings that have been attributed to Ali. I specifically use the word “attributed” because that is all that it is. According to popular Shia opinion, the collection was gathered by Al-Shareef Al-Murtadha (d. 436) or his brother Al-Radhi (d. 406).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Thahabi writes in Al-Murtadha’s biography in Siyar A’alam Al-Nubala’ 2/2774:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He is the compiler of Nahj Al-Balagha that contains words that have been attributed to Imam Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). It contains no chains. Some of it is false and within it is some truth. However, it contains fabrications that the Imam would never speak of, god-forbid.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Thahabi is correct. Nahj Al-Balagha, is after all, a collection of sayings, and sayings do not have any weight without chains of narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Al-Shareef Al-Murtadha and Al-Radhi were fifth century scholars with no direct access to Ali or his words anymore than any of their contemporaries. That being said, academically, it is far greater a crime to accept everything that has been attributed to Ali in this book than it is to reject it completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in light of this that the Shia scholar Al-Sayyed Abdul Zahra’ Al-Hussaini authored his “Masadir Nahj Al-Balagha wa Asaneeduh”. This four volume work is a collection of Nahj Al-Balagha itself along with commentary that includes other references for the attributed speeches one by one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it is not surprising that many of the sermons and sayings in Abdul Zahra’s book do not contain chains of narrations. One does not need to look further than the very first sermon. After Abdul Zahra’ provides six additional sources to the sermon 1/297, he then claims that it is impossible that these sources came together to fabricate this sermon (even though its chainless).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately for Abdul Zahra’, the claim is not that Al-Shareef Al-Radhi, concocted these sermons himself, but rather, that these sermons are fabricated. The earliest source that Abdul Zahra’ provides for this sermon is Mohammad bin Al-Hasan Al-Harrani, a fourth century scholar. Since that is the case, how could anyone be so lenient in accepting a narration simply because it existed in a fourth century source?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abdul Zahra’ then admits that the eloquence of “text does not require a chain.” In other words, this admittance suggests that it is the biases of Abdul Zahra’ that leads him to accepting the report as authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, this level of scholarship is the best any Shia scholar can do. Truly, they cannot do anything more than to claim that: This is so eloquent; it must have been said by Ali!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second sermon cannot be verified either. It is also documented in two later sources and only the last sentence or two can be found in an earlier fourth century source. None of these include chains either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, what is one to do with short pieces of sermons and texts? Take for example what we find in Word of Wisdom #169: It is wiser to abstain then to repent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How about Word of Wisdom #186: Death is never very far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refer to the chapter of <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/articles/various-sayings-imam-ali-ibn-abi-talib-imam-ali-ibn-abu-talib#sayings-imam-%E2%80%98ali-nahjul-balagha" rel="external nofollow">“Saying of Imam ‘Ali (A.S.) from Nahj Al-Balagha”</a> for many more examples of these short saying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Truly, there is wisdom in these words. Yet, could these not have come from any wise person? The Arabic books of literature are loaded with the most eloquent of sayings of wisdom. Surely, a biased Shi’ee will say, “Only Imam Ali could have uttered such pearls.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To such weak-minded opinions a response is not warranted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very ironic that Shias will jump in the defense of Nahj Al-Balagha, when virtually every Shia will argue that there is no authentic book other than the book of Allah. It is as if they only say such a thing when criticizing Sunnis, but among themselves, they believe in the complete authenticity of Nahj Al-Balagha. Shias need to free themselves from such a double-standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I add, most of these long sermons cannot be found in their final form in which they are found today in al-Nahj. Scholars are able to find bits and scraps of sentences used in different narrations but they aren&#8217;t the full sermons as we know them, so where did al-Radhi get those specific sermons in their entirety? This isn&#8217;t just in one or two sermons, but in a big number of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What casts further doubts on their honesty, is that `Ali has a few popular sermons that are known yet these sermons were not included in Nahj-ul-Balaghah. He even has a long sermon in praise of Abu Bakr which was obviously omitted even though it has a chain. Even big shia scholars such as al-Kulayni did not include these sermons in his encyclopedia al-Kafi and acted as if he never heard of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed. One could simply end a debate with Shias that affirm the authenticity of Nahj Al-Balagha by asking the following questions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Is there any other book authentic other than the book of Allah?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- How do you know that Nahj Al-Balagha is authentic when it has no chains and comes from a fifth century source?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- How can you attribute a text to Ali simply on the basis of eloquence when it is mostly a subjective matter? Perhaps the words of wisdom belonged to the Prophet peace be upon him, or to another Imam. An even likelier scenario is that some of these words of wisdom were by others, but were erroneously attributed to Ali. An even likelier scenario is that many of these sermons were in reality fabrications by eloquent Arabs who wanted to attribute their views to Ali in the same way that fabricators have fabricated narrations in jurisprudence and ideology to the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; and the Twelve Imams.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Sermon without Dots </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An additional piece of evidence of the semi-divine eloquence of Ali is his sermon that does not include any dots. Laymen Shia take great pride in this, assuming that only one with that only Ali may be able to accomplish such a feat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea behind this is that the sermon does not contain any of the following letters:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ب – ت – ث – ج – خ – ذ – ز – ش – ض – ظ – غ – ف – ق – ن – ي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The exclusion of fifteen letters from Arabic alphabet, more than half of the letters, is indeed a severe handicap, which makes it especially difficult to come up with an eloquent speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon can be found on <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/articles/various-sayings-imam-ali-ibn-abi-talib-imam-ali-ibn-abu-talib#sayings-imam-%E2%80%98ali-nahjul-balagha" rel="external nofollow">al-islam.org.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the attribution of the sermons to Ali in the first place needs to be confirmed, but yet, the emotional Shi’ee refuses to even consider that man has the ability to attain such brilliance, and thus, no academic research is required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, we have found that Ibn Al-Jawzi in his Ajeeb Al-Khutab (See Majmu’ Rasa’il Ibn Al-Jawzi p. 99-134), has included a sermon authored by himself, in which he has excluded all the letters with dots. He states in his introduction:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was discussing with some of my friends regarding the Arabic alphabet. One of them argued that any discourse or term cannot be fully viable unless all the letters of the alphabet exist within it. He spoke of a sermon with him where the letter: “Alif”, is omitted from it. I got excited and decided to write sermons. From each I omit a letter from the alphabet. I wrote twenty-nine sermons based on the letters of alphabet’s number; then I added a sermon that doesn’t contain any dots. The sermons reached the number of thirty. I collected them in a book entitled: “The Astonishing Sermons”. (p. 99)</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">الحمد لله الواحد الأحد، وكل أحد سواه مطلع الأعداد، العادل الصمد، ولا والد ولا ولد، ملك وصور وحكم، ولا مساعد ولا إسعاد، وأمهل وأهلك أهل الرد والإلحاد، وسمك السماء ومسك ولا حامل ولا عماد، وسطح المهاد وأوسع ولا أوطار ولا وساد، وكل طامع حاد عما سمع حال حاله لما حاد، ولا وصول إلا لواله صد لأمل الوصال حلاوة الوساد، ولا ورد إلا الساهر وأورد طعم المورود مرار السهاد، إله وعد أهل السعادة أعلى محل وأكرم مراد، وهدى أهل الإهمال سوء المرصاد وهول المعاد، عالم سامع مدرك مسمع لا عمل لعامل إلا ما أراد، الملهد هالك والموحد مالك ومسلك السلامة سعادة الوراد، أحمده وأوحده حمدا أعده للأهوال الحداد، وأمدح رسوله أكرم العموم وأكرم الآحاد، سلام الله واصل ما لاح لامع وأدلهم سواد، مواصل صدور أهل الكمال والسداد، وسلم وكرم. وصلى على محمد المكرم .ـ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just in case, a cheeky Shi’ee tries to point out the dots in the “Taa Al-Marboota” at the end of words like Al-Sa’ada (السعادة), we simply counter by pointing out that the sermon attributed to Ali does the same:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The falsely attributed sermon includes:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">وها هو إمامكم وحل حرمكم مملكا، عروسكم <strong>المكرمه</strong>، وما مهر لها كما مهر رسول الله أم <strong>سلمه</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The text is translated as: “<em>your domain will thus be rightful, your brides <strong>honored</strong>, and let her [bride] dower be just as the Messenger of Allah (</em><em>ص</em><em>) had paid to Umm <strong>Salamah</strong>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have bolded the words that in reality do include dots, for Al-Mukaramah (المكرمة) and Um Salama (أم سلمة) are correctly written with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another scholar that also was known for his eloquence was Ibn Al-Batookh Al-Hanbali, who also wrote sermons without certain letters and has a sermon without any dots. See Masadir Nahj Al-Balagha 1/269.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, there is no evidence that the sermon of Ali that is free from dots is authentically attributed to him. Al-Radhi not including it in his book is sufficient proof that it either did not exist at his time, or that he recognized it to be a fabrication. I add, Arabic words at the time did not have dotted-letters either-way, old manuscripts of political letters, documents or Qur&#8217;anic scripture did not have dots below or above letters, these were only added much later by abu al-Aswad al-Du&#8217;ali in order to make the recitation easier for non-Arabs.</p>
