<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: </p>



<p>This paper evaluates the historical authenticity of a prominent ḥadīth that is regularly cited amidst Sunnī-Shi&#8217;ite polemical discussions, the long ḥadīth of Abū Balj regarding`Alī&#8217;s merits. The significance of this Prophetic tradition stems from several clauses within it that are perceived to be aligned with Shi&#8217;ite theology and relevant to debates on the successorship of the Prophet. A careful study of this tradition, however, will demonstrate the presence of various defects in its transmission that ultimately undermine and dispel its historical authenticity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nad-e-Ali&#8221; is a famous supplication that is popular among certain Twelver communities today. To the average Muslim, the duaa is a clear and apparent manifestation of <em>ghuluww</em> (extremism) in the status of &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb, which has unfortunately been normalized in Twelver theology. Similarly, it is an example of how <em>shirk</em> had been appropriated in the name of Twelver Shi&#8217;ism.</p>
<p>The duaa is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call upon &#8216;Ali, the manifester of wonders</p>
<p>You shall surely find him an aid during your difficulties</p>
<p>Every sorrow and distress shall disappear</p>
<p>by your Wilayah. Ya Ali ! Ya Ali ! Ya Ali !</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, this famous supplication is not even authentic according to Twelver hadith standards. The author of the first Shi&#8217;ite source to ever allude to this supplication died in 1111 AH, a whopping 1000+ years after the death of the Prophet. The book is no other than <em>Bihar Al-Anwar </em>by Al-Majlisi. What is further damning is that the late Majlisi did not even list an isnad for this supposed supplication, so it is a baseless report according to Shi&#8217;ite standards, let alone Sunni standards.</p>
<p>What did Al-Majlisi say as he listed this supplication in his compilation?</p>
<p>Al-Majlisi simply commented saying: &#8220;It is said that Messenger of Allah was told on that day [Badr]: &#8230;.&#8221; and he proceeded to list the duaa known as Nad-e-Ali (Majlisi 20:73).</p>
<p>Even the Shi&#8217;ite editor of <em>Bihar Al-Anwar</em>, Ali Akbar Ghifari, made note of the report&#8217;s bizarre wording. In the footnotes, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last sentence [in the report] is weird, and it does not fit with the previous sentence. It seems as though it is an addition by some ignorant folk or the misguided Sufis who claim that such statements are supplications. Thus, they mention them as dhikr and repeatable prayers. Some of them even believe that repeating these statements has a virtue that is not even found in Salah! May Allah protect us from innovations and followers of their desires. (Majlisi 20:73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One may find himself asking, &#8220;What is the source of this baseless fabrication?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Afghan Sunni theologian, Mulla &#8216;Ali Qari (d. 1014) was the first individual to ever cite this alleged supplication. In his collection of fabricated reports, <em>Al-Asrar Al-Marfu&#8217;ah fi Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu&#8217;ah</em>, he said: &#8220;Another appalling fabrication of the Shia is the hadith: call upon &#8216;Ali the manifestor of wonders&#8230;.&#8221; (Qari 385). One hundred years later, the report &#8220;magically&#8221; appears in the Shi&#8217;ite collection, <em>Bihar Al-Anwar</em>, without an isnad with a 1000+ year-long gap in its transmission.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is that Mulla &#8216;Ali Qari and Al-Majlisi came from the same era, and they both came from proximate Farsi-speaking regions. Thus, it is evident that this report was first circulated in Khorasan and surrounding Farsi-speaking provinces by the tenth/eleventh century, which unsurprisingly coincides with the rise of the Twelver Safavids in Persia. Hence, the report is exclusively found in collections from that era.</p>
<p>Twelver prayer books today contain various renditions of this fabricated supplication, with some spanning multiple pages. This <a href="https://www.duas.org/Misc/nade_ali_kabeer.htm" rel="external nofollow">website</a> provides an example of a distorted redaction of this hadith that is recited by the Shia today.</p>
<p>Those who opt to base their faith on 11th century Shi&#8217;ite Safavid fabrications from Persia will cling on to this report (and similar fabrications), but those who follow Allah&#8217;s commands will remember his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When my servants ask you about Me, tell them that I am very close. I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls Me; therefore, they should respond to Me and put their trust in Me, so that they may be rightly guided. [Quran 2:186]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Allah is the Witness of Abu Al-Abbas.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">by Abdullah Moataz</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p id="h.p_upC2hPFIV261" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">One of the more profound hadiths regarding the superiority of ‘Ali b. Abi Talib and his virtues, is a hadith found in Sahih Muslim. Shi’ite polemicists constantly use the hadith in their proselytizing efforts with Sunnis. The hadith in Muslim is worded as follows:</p>
<p id="h.p_lWTs_sszV262" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">‘Ali b. Abi Talib said, “I swear by Him who split the seed and created people, it is the illiterate Prophet’s promise to me that none shall love me except a believer, and none shall hate me except a hypocrite.”</p>
<p id="h.p_kMEPkXbuV262" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Before going directly into the issue, I will give two introductions that, by the permission of Allah, will facilitate a better understanding of the issue at hand. The first issue is directly related to Sahih Muslim as a book, and the second issue relates to Al-Daraqutni’s criticism of the hadith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_ToRmzUtMV263" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim’s Methodology in his <em>Sahih</em></strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_LEO0QVfMV263" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Unlike many other compilers of hadith, Muslim b. Al-Hajjaj wrote an introduction to his Sahih. Besides the historical value of it, as well the wealth of information contained in it regarding hadith method, Muslim also details his methodology in compiling his Sahih. One of the important aspects of Muslim’s Sahih is his inclusion of defective reports in their relevant chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_Pw-UTpKxV264" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Essentially, and without going in too much detail on the topic, Muslim typically begins the chapter by mentioning the most authentic reports on the issue and following it up by mentioning reports of lesser transmitters, and then ending occasionally with a defective hadith. A more detailed study of this aspect of Muslim’s Sahih can be found in Hamzah Al-Malibari’s “<em>’Abqariyyat Al-Imam Muslim fi Tartib Ahadith Musnadihi Al-Sahih.” </em></p>
<p id="h.p_ydzNHFczV264" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">All that needs to be understood from this is that, not only is it possible that an inauthentic hadith appears in Sahih Muslim, but that it is likely that Muslim included it in his Sahih simply to demonstrate its inauthenticity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_4Ao0KVw-V265" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Daraqutni’s Criticism</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_G8p7haJOV265" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In <em>Al-Tatabbu’</em>, where Al-Daraqutni compiled a selection of ahadith he considered to be weak in the two Sahihs, he includes the hadith in question. Al-Daraqutni, however, didn’t expressly state what he found problematic about the hadith. This left the door wide open for academics and researchers to determine what exactly Al-Daraqutni’s issue was.</p>
<p id="h.p_xK8YjkMxV266" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Rabi’ b. Hadi Al-Madkhali, in his master’s thesis “Bayn Al-Imamayn,” deals specifically with the portion of criticized ahadith found in Sahih Muslim. When analyzing the hadith, he understands, that the presence of ‘Adiyy b. Thabit, a reliable yet Shi’ite transmitter, is the cause of Al-Daraqutni’s concern and criticism (Al-Madkhali 39).</p>
<p id="h.p_gxIgfcZwV266" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">If Al-Madkhali is correct in his assumption, the crux of the issue would be concerning a heretic’s transmission in support of their heresy, a detailed and controversial issue found in the books of <em>Mustalah</em>.</p>
<p id="h.p_qPv6jt2iV267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Our friend Farid, challenged this assumption, and pointed out the existence of an actual hadith defect. After reflection, it appears that Farid’s hypothesis is more likely. If there is an actual hadith defect, there would be no reason to explain the criticism with a more elaborate and controversial explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_E3-uG-C5V267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Isnad</strong></em><strong> Analysis </strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_HYFxk6nEV267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The hadith originates from Al-A’mash, from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit, from Zirr b. Hubaysh, from ‘Ali b. Abi Talib.</p>
<p id="h.p_i_zKCAszV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Al-A’mash is a famous <em>Hafiz</em>, and reliable transmitter, though occasionally practices <em>tadlis</em>. He needs no introduction.</p>
<p id="h.p_n-azpgMFV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">‘Adiyy b. Thabit is also a reliable transmitter despite his Shi’ite leanings.</p>
<p id="h.p_VyD4HQyIV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Abu Hatim Al-Razi said, “Trustworthy, and he was the Imam of the Shi’ite masjid, and their speaker” (Al-Razi 2)</p>
<p id="h.p_RQHv4tJcV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Ahmed b. Hanbal said, “‘Adiyy b. Thabit is reliable, though he used to be a Shi’ite” (B. Hanbal 490).</p>
<p id="h.p_fg3UFDVEV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Al-Daraqutni said, “Reliable, though he was a Rafidi, very extreme in it” (Al-Sulami 210)</p>
<p id="h.p_mp4gOThbV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Zirr b. Hubaysh is another reliable transmitter without controversy, though he is said to have anti-‘Ali leanings.</p>
<p id="h.p_MyVXJdDYV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In reality, the only defect in the chain would be the possibility of Al-A’mash’s <em>tadlis</em> here, which is unaccounted for. <em>Tadlis</em> is a way of transmitting hadith, wherein the “student” drops the intermediary, his source of transmission, and ambiguously transmits it from their mutual “teacher.” It is not a form of lying, as the “student” never expressly states they directly acquired the hadith from the “teacher.” Typically, transmitters guilty of this practice are scrutinized more, and their transmission isn’t accepted unless it is expressly stated how they acquired the report.</p>
<p id="h.p_xNEDQRCjV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">After a thorough search, I was unable to find any report where he expressly transmits it from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit.</p>
<p id="h.p_gHxdkTGeV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Besides this glaring defect, we have another indicator that suggests this report was never actually transmitted by ‘Adiyy b. Thabit from Zirr b. Hubaysh.</p>
<p id="h.p_Oc0dnLnhV27A" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">As previously mentioned, Zirr b. Hubaysh was thought to have anti-‘Ali leanings. If this was the case, why would he be transmitted a hadith about the virtues of ‘Ali? Mind you, the hadith is not simply about the virtues of ‘Ali, but it is a highly exaggerated praise as well. While this point isn’t strong enough to stand alone, it is a factor that must be considered seriously, especially when there is an actual hadith defect present in the chain as well. The existence of <em>tadlis</em> in the chain, as well as this factor together, make a strong argument for the hadith’s inauthenticity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_v0ssMqY0V27B" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim’s Placement</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_gLUra_9FV27C" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Muslim’s placement of the hadith is most interesting. In terms of topical placement, the hadith doesn’t seem to fit in its place. Muslim’s places it after five other hadith reports mentioning the virtues of the Ansar. Obviously, the hadith isn’t in the relevant chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_yuHY_7d1V27D" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In terms of ordering, it is the last hadith placed in the chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_SCQG61f7V27D" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Why does Muslim do this? I would argue that Muslim’s actions may only be understood as an implicit criticism of the hadith. Consider the following point:</p>
<p id="h.p_aJCuJ9TtV27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In the same chapter, Muslim records another hadith, originating from Shu’bah, who transmits it from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit. The premise of this hadith is similar to the one in question, with one major difference. Instead of it referring to ‘Ali, a lone individual, it refers to the Ansar, a group of people.</p>
<p id="h.p_pm_yRBhtV27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">What’s the issue? A critic would be very suspicious when seeing this. It is strange to find two independent reports, that supposedly have the same origin and source, both of which share in the major premise, yet differ in one part. For the critic, the more likely explanation, especially considering the other two factors previously mentioned, is that an error occurred in the transmission of the hadith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_NUs0r264V27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Matn Analysis </strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_PtMu6N2uV27F" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The first clause of the report reads, “<strong>By Him who split the seed, and created people</strong>”</p>
<p id="h.p_V9FC15D_V27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">This phrase was actually used by ‘Ali at least once, as found in a hadith in Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p id="h.p_Er76rpzsV27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The second clause of the report reads, “<strong>It is the illiterate Prophet’s promise to me that</strong>…”</p>
<p id="h.p_QYEAsC_CV27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">As a phrase “The illiterate Prophet – Al-Nabi Al-Ummi,” is found in the Qur’an, as well as supplications, and others, as can be found in hadith literature. I was not able to find a single instance, authentically transmitted, where a Companion used this phrase in reference to the Prophet.</p>
<p id="h.p_ho6PxikWV27H" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The third clause of the report reads, “<strong>None shall love me except a believer, and none shall hate me except a hypocrite.”</strong></p>
<p id="h.p_wrzqr-y2V27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">I find this clause to be problematic.</p>
<p id="h.p_zXDRsI2HV27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Hatred of an individual, with the exception of a Prophet, is never an act of disbelief or hypocrisy, unless the hatred directed to them is theological. This is perfectly demonstrated by an incident that happened during the Prophet’s life, as can be found in Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p id="h.p_U2-6CvVfV27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">An incident regarding the spoils of war occurred between Buraydah, and ‘Ali, which caused animosity between them from Buraydah’s side. He relates that he informed the Prophet of the incident, to which the Prophet asked him, “Do you hate ‘Ali?” Buraydah responded, “Yes.” The Prophet then said, “Don’t hate him, as his share in the Khums (fifth) is more than that.”</p>
<p id="h.p_FI_VuO08V27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Based on this account, the Prophet only told Buraydah to not hate ‘Ali. He didn’t add that was disbelief or that Buraydah was now a hypocrite due to his personal issues with ‘Ali. It makes complete sense that hatred of an individual would not be disbelief, since it is possible that a person could hate another based on a personal problem, as Buraydah did, and not due to disbelief. On the other hand, hatred of a certain group of people is liable to be a sign of disbelief, since a person cannot have a personal problem with a whole group of people. For example, hatred of the Ansar as a whole cannot be except due to disbelief, since the only common link between all of them is their Islam and status, therefore, hatred of them must be because of that. Whereas, if a person were to hate one individual from the Ansar, the same ruling wouldn’t apply, as it is very likely that the hatred could simply be as a result of a personal issue between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_VfpxYmfqV27K" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_D71WYRIsV27L" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Though this hadith was included by Muslim in his <em>Sahih</em>, it isn’t authentic. It appears as though Muslim himself also believed this, and only reproduced the report in his <em>Sahih</em> to demonstrate its weakness in accordance with his methodology. Unlike some have suggested, the defect of the hadith is not ‘Adiyy b. Thabit or his Shi’ite leanings, but the <em>tadlis</em> of Al-A’mash. Furthermore, the implications of the report, if understood in its general or absolute sense, are false.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report we shall study in this article is an alleged prophetic explanation of a verse in the Qur’an, that has been appealed to by some Shi’a. In this article, I will be applying the method of early hadith critics in analyzing both the chain and text of this report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The study will be divided into three parts:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A presentation of the report in question</li>
<li>A study of its chain</li>
<li>A study of its text</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Presentation of Report</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report in question was recorded by Ahmed in” Fadha’il Al-Sahabah,” Ibn Abi Hatim in his Tafsir, Al-Wahidi in his “Al-Wasit,” and Al-Tabarani in his “Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabir,” all of whom transmit it via Husayn Al-Ashqar, from Qays, from Al-A’mash, from Sa’id bin Jubayr, from Ibn ‘Abbas, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the verse “I ask of you no reward (payment), except <em>mawaddah</em> (love/kindness) for kinship,” was revealed, the companions asked, “Who are these kin whom we are obligated to love?” The Prophet replied, “‘Ali, Fatimah, and their two sons.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chain Analysis</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As preceded, the report originates from Husayn Al-Ashqar, from Qays, from Al-A’mash, from Sa’id bin Jubayr, from Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin, Husyan Al-Ashqar isn’t considered reliable.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Abu Hatim Al-Razi says, “He isn’t strong in hadith.”</li>
<li>Abu Zur’ah says, “He is an objectionable transmitter.”</li>
<li>Al-Nassa’i says, “He isn’t strong.”</li>
<li>Al-Daraqutni says, “He wasn’t strong.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears as though some accused him of intentional hadith fabrication, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. In fact, Ahmed bin Hanbal said, “In my opinion, he didn’t used to fabricate hadith.” In conclusion, though he isn’t reliable, he didn’t forge hadith.  It should also be noted that Ibn Hajar counted Husayn as an extreme Shi’i.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Qays, in the report, is Qays bin Rabi’ Al-Asadi. Even though he was an honest and trustworthy transmitter, he too isn’t reliable.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Abu Zur’ah said, “Weak.”</li>
<li>Abu Hatim, “His reports are written, but not relied upon.”</li>
<li>Al-Nassa’i said, “He isn’t reliable.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Others, like Ibn ‘Adiyy have a better opinion of him, but the majority of hadith critics agree that Qays isn’t reliable, as preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-A’mash, of course, is a Hafiz, and all agree upon his reliability and accuracy. He is known as a prolific transmitter, transmitting a large number of reports, and was “lucky” enough to have many regular students transmitting from him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sa’id bin Jubayr, the famous student of Ibn ‘Abbas is also reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hadith critics apply a principle in certain scenarios that potentially indicate that a serious mistake occurred in transmission. In essence, not all reliable hadith transmitters are of the same level. Variation occurs in both, the quantity of transmission, as well as the number of students they have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, it becomes problematic when an average transmitter exclusively narrates from a reliable transmitter who is known for their great quantity or sheer number of transmitted reports, especially when the latter would have a considerable number of students who regularly attend his sessions. That problem is compounded when the transmitter is considered unreliable. A Muhaddith would become skeptical of the situation and ask themselves, “Why didn’t the other students transmit the same report? Where are the reliable transmitters who habitually attended his sessions for years?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our situation, Husayn bin Al-Ashqar, an unreliable transmitter, transmits from Qays bin Al-Rabi’, another unreliable transmitter, who then exclusively transmits from Al-A’mash, a report that isn’t found amongst any of the reliable or even <em>unreliable </em>students of Al-A’mash. There is no other way to explain this, other than a serious error has occurred in the transmission of this hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Textual Analysis</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problems with this report don’t end with the issues found in the chain of transmission. Indeed, there are problems in the content that further indicate the occurrence of an error.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, it is authentically established from Ibn ‘Abbas that he explained the verse in question, in a different manner. Had he really transmitted the alleged prophetic interpretation of the verse, how would he allow himself to give a contradictory interpretation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tawus reported that Sa’id ibn Jubayr explained the verse to refer to the household of the Prophet. Ibn ‘Abbas corrected him saying, “You have been hasty. There is no branch of Quraysh, except that the Prophet had relatives from.” He went to interpret the verse as, “Except for you to keep the ties due to what is between us of kinship.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is recorded by Al-Bukhari in his “Sahih,” Al-Tirmidhi in his “Jami’,” Ibn Hibban in his “Sahih,” Ibn Jarir in his tafsir, Al-Hakim his “Al-Mustadrak,” Al-Wahidi in his “Al-Wasit,” as well as others, all of whom transmit via Shu’bah bin Al-Hajjaj, from Abdul-Malik bin Maysarah, from Tawus, from Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is another authentic and independent chain from Ibn ‘Abbas that came as a result of Al-Sha’bi’s question to him about the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is recorded by Ibn Sa’d in his “Al-Tabaqat,” Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir, Al-Bayhaqi in his “Al-Dala’il,” all of whom transmit from Dawud bin Abi Hind, from Al-Sha’bi, from Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of these chains are obviously authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is further transmitted via the famous tafsir chains from Ibn ‘Abbas that are mentioned by Ibn Jarir, and others in their Tafasir. And though the reliability of these famous tafsir chains are usually debated, the fact that we have the two independently authentic chains lends credence to their veracity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, it is authentically established from some of Ibn ‘Abbas’s own students that they gave interpretations of the verse, contradictory to the alleged prophetic interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, ‘Ikrimah, as recorded by Ibn Sa’d in his “Al-Tabaqat,” interprets it in a similar way that Ibn ‘Abbas did. After explaining that there wasn’t a branch of Quraysh that the Prophet wasn’t related to, he explains the verse as meaning, “If you don’t protect me by virtue of what I was sent with, at least protect me by virtue of the kinship that exists between us.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is further transmitted from Mujahid, another student of Ibn ‘Abbas, though the chain to him, may be problematic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, the very occasion for Ibn ‘Abbas’ interpretation was to clear up the misconception that would later be propagated by the hadith in question.  This is indicated by Al-Sha’bi’s transmission from Ibn ‘Abbas which preceded. Al-Sha’bi wrote to Ibn ‘Abbas after a controversy on the meaning of the verse ensued. Furthermore, Sa’id bin Jubayr seems to have fallen for the misconception and Ibn ‘Abbas had to clear it up for him as well, telling him, “You have been hasty.” Since he is clearing up what he considered to be a misconception, he couldn’t have possible transmitted the very report which would lend credence to the very misconception he is refuting!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>, the context of the verses in the Qur’an, as well as its historical context support Ibn ‘Abbas’ explanation. The context of the verse suggests an exchange between the Prophet and the Mushrikin, wherein he would plead with them, for their own sake, to keep the ties of kinship between them and him. It doesn’t seem likely that the Prophet would be telling the mushrikin to show love and kindness, specifically to the family of his daughter, which had yet to exist. Ibn Kathir comments, “It [the surah] is Makki, and at that time Fatimah had no children, as she did not marry ‘Ali until after the battle of badr, in the second year after hijrah.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we take in all the factors mentioned about both, the chain, and its text, it becomes clear that this hadith is baseless. The question that asks itself is, “What, then, is the origin of this hadith? Where did the error come from?” After all, the report has to have come from somewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we don’t assume malicious intent in the forging of the hadith, I think it is safe to say that it probably started as an opinion of Sa’id bin Jubayr, and as it was passed down, it eventually was attributed to the Prophet, and since Sa’id was a well-known student of Ibn ‘Abbas, it was attributed to the Prophet through him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Someone may say, “Well, this sounds like a fancy theory, but what evidence supports it?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For one, we know that Sa’id bin Jubayr held the opinion that they verse was referring to the household of the Prophet. It is reported as such in the Sahih Al-Bukhari account that preceded, wherein Ibn ‘Abbas corrected him. It is also reported through another chain of transmission from him in Al-Tabari’s Tafsir. This shows that there is basis for Sa’id’s presence in the chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sa’id’s never stated that they household of the Prophet that he was referring to were only Fatimah, ‘Ali, and their two sons. How did, “household of the Prophet,” change to “Fatimah, ‘Ali, and their two sons?” I theorize that when Qays passed down the report (already incorrectly attributed to the Prophet) to Husayn Al-Ashqar, Husayn felt the liberty to paraphrase the hadith, as some transmitters do. Being the Shi’I that he was, he paraphrased, “household of the Prophet,” in a way that a Shi’i would understand it: Fatimah, ‘Ali, and her two sons. In essence, it was a rephrasing of the report, in an explanatory manner, as understood by the Shi’i transmitter.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>What is a Nāṣibī?</u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very common for one to hear the accusation that Muḥammad b. Ismā’īl al-Bukhārī (author of the Ṣaḥīḥ) was a <em>Nāṣibī</em>, and there are several points that are usually presented to justify this accusation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we address the accusation, it is important that we first define what a <em>Nāṣibī </em>actually is. Renowned linguists and lexicographers: Ibn Manẓūr<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, al-Fairūzābādī<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> and al-Zubaidī<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> all list the same definition of <em>Nawāṣib </em>in their dictionaries:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Those who, out of religious fervor, have animosity towards Alī [b. Abī Ṭāleb]”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The common definition of a <em>Nāṣibī </em>among Shi’ite and Sunni scholarship (i.e. al-Khoei<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, al-Muḥaqqiq al-Ḥillī<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, Ibn Taymiyah<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> etc.) is:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“An individual who openly displays hatred and animosity towards Ahlulbait”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it can be generally said that a <em>Nāṣibī </em>is an individual who openly displays hatred towards Alī and the rest of <em>Ahlulbait</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main points that are brought up to assert this supposed notion:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Bukhārī did not transmit a single report through Ja’far al-Ṣāḍiq in his Ṣaḥīḥ</li>
<li>Bukhārī transmitted ḥadīths through well-known <em>Nawāṣib/Khawārij </em>in his Ṣaḥīḥ</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, a detailed analysis of these arguments is enough to show that they stem from invalid premises that do not validate the conclusion presented.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Bukhārī &amp; Ja’far al-Ṣāḍiq</u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assumption made in this argument is that Bukhārī avoided transmitting ḥadīth from Ja’far because he had <em>naṣb</em> and animosity towards <em>Ahlulbait.</em> However, the flaws in this argument become apparent when one simply notes the transmitters from <em>Ahlulbait </em>Bukhārī did include in his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Transmitters from <em>Ahlulbait </em>in Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bukhārī transmits ḥadīth in his Ṣaḥīḥ through a plethora of transmitters from <em>Ahlulbait</em>, such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Fāṭimah b. Muḥammadﷺ</li>
<li>‘Alī b. Abī Ṭāleb (Ja’far’s great-great grandfather)</li>
<li>al-‘Abbās b. Abdulmuttalīb</li>
<li>al-Fadl b. al-‘Abbās b. ‘Abdulmuttaleb</li>
<li>al-Ḥusain b. Alī b. Abī Ṭāleb (Ja’far’s great-grandfather)</li>
<li>‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbās b. ‘Abdulmuttaleb</li>
<li>‘Abdullah b. Ja’far b. Abī Ṭāleb</li>
<li>‘Alī b. al-Ḥusain (Ja’far’s grandfather)</li>
<li>Muḥammad al-Bāqir (Ja’far’s father)</li>
<li>Muḥammad b. al-Hanafiyyah</li>
<li>Kathīr b. al-‘Abbās b. Abdulmutṭaleb</li>
<li>‘Abdullah b. ‘Abdullah b. al-Ḥārith b. Nawfal b. al-Ḥārith b. ‘Abdulmuttaleb</li>
<li>‘Abdullah b. al-Fadl b. al-‘Abbās b. Rabī’ah b. al-Ḥārith b. Abdulmuttaleb</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a list of transmitters from <em>Ahlulbait </em>Bukhārī included in his Ṣaḥīḥ. If we were to include transmitters Bukhārī included in his other books, such as: al-Adab al-Mufrad, the list would span tens of other transmitters from the Prophet’s family and progeny. Thus, it is evident that Bukhārī did not have an issue with transmitting ḥadīth through <em>Ahlulbait.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Virtues of <em>Ahlulbait </em>in Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only does Bukhārī transmit ḥadīth through members of <em>Ahlulbait</em> in his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>, </em>but he also includes several chapters in his book dedicated to the virtues of key individuals from <em>Ahlulbait</em>. This can be seen in several chapters listed in his Ṣaḥīḥ, such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>“The Virtues of Fāṭimah”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
<li>“The Virtues of Alī b. Abī Ṭāleb”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
<li>“The Virtues of al-Ḥasan and al-Ḥusain” <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
<li>“The Virtues of Ja’far b. Abī Ṭāleb”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
<li>“The Virtues of the Relatives of the Prophet ﷺ and the Virtue of Fāṭimah, the daughter of the Prophet ﷺ” <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In these chapters, he transmits numerous reports that display the status and virtues of many key members from <em>Ahlulbait</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, Bukhārī transmits a ḥadīth through Ibrāhīm b. Sa’d from his father, who said: The Prophet ﷺ said to ‘Alī: &#8220;Are you not be pleased that you are to me like Aaron was to Moses?&#8221; <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, Bukhārī transmits a report through ‘Ai’sha, who transmits from Fāṭimah that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Are you not pleased to be the head of all women in Paradise?” <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also transmits a report through Abū Bakrah, who said: I heard the Prophet ﷺ talking on the pulpit with al-Ḥasan besides him, and He [the Prophet ﷺ] looked at the audience [for a moment], then turn towards al-Ḥasan [for a moment] saying: “This son of mine is a <em>Sayyid</em>, and perhaps Allah will bring about an agreement between two groups of Muslims through him.” <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also transmits a ḥadīth through Ibn ‘Umar where he quotes the Prophet ﷺ describing al-Ḥasan and al-Ḥusain, saying: “They are my two fragrant blossoms of this world” <a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is clear that Bukhārī had no issue in transmitting reports that demonstrated the virtues of <em>Ahlulbait</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Bukhārī’s Exclusion of Some of His Key Teachers in his Ṣaḥīḥ:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important point that must be made is that Bukhārī excluded the reports several of his key teachers (and transmitters) from his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>, </em>and this has no implications on Bukhārī’s perception of those individuals. For example, Bukhārī does not transmit a single ḥadīth in his Ṣaḥīḥ directly through:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Aḥmed b. Ḥanbal (his sheikh)</li>
<li>Muḥammad b. Idrīs al-Shāfi’ī</li>
<li>Usāmah b. Sharīk (a companion of the Prophet ﷺ)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renowned 5<sup>th</sup> century muḥadīth, al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, elaborates on Bukhārī’s exclusion of al-Shāfi’ī from his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>, </em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“What we say in Bukhārī’s exclusion of al-Shāfi’īsḥadīth from his Ṣaḥīḥ was that it was not due to a weakness in the transmission of al-Shāfi’ī. <u>Rather, it was because Bukhārī had access to higher chains of transmission (with less men) than those he would have transmitted through al-Shāfi’ī…</u>”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Closely after that, he says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Bukhārī never met al-Shāfi’ī, <u>yet he transmitted ḥadīth from transmitters that were older than him in age and transmission</u>….”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khaṭīb then says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Bukhārī transmitted from several <em>shuyukh </em>of al-Shāfi’ī himself, such as: Abdullah b. Maslamah al-Qa’nabī, ‘Abdullah b. Yusuf al-Tanīsī, Ismā’il b. Abī Uwais, Abdul’azīz al-Uwaisī (etc) .”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As one can see, Bukhārī omitted al-Shāfi’ī from his Ṣaḥīḥ for technical reasons due to the fact that Bukhārī, himself, had access to shorter, more authentic <em>isnāds.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is evident that Bukhārī may exclude the reports of certain transmitters if he has access to shorter, more authentic <em>isnāds </em>through other individuals<em>. </em>This omission has no implications on Bukhārī’s perception of those individuals, personally or theologically speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example of a reason why Bukhārī excluded certain transmitters from his Ṣaḥīḥ is the companion of the Prophet ﷺ, Usāmah b. Sharīk. The reason Bukhārī avoids his reports has nothing to do with his status as a transmitter. Rather, the renowned 4<sup>th</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> century muḥaddith, al-Ḥākim al-Naysābūri explains the reason why Bukhārī had avoided Usāmah’s reports. al-Ḥākim says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abū al-Ḥasan ‘Alī b. Umar al-Hafidh once asked me: “Why did they [Bukhārī &amp; Muslim] omit Usāmah b. Sharīk from both books?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Ḥākim responds saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“<u>Because his reports were exclusively transmitted through Ziyad b. ‘Ilaqah</u>”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this example, al-Ḥākim presents an example of a reliable and trustworthy transmitter who was omitted by al-Bukhārī simply due to the fact that his reports were exclusively transmitted through a problematic transmitter in his eyes. Again, this omission has no implications on the status of Usāmah as a reliable transmitter and companion of the Prophet ﷺ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just a few examples, but there are many other technical indicators that could account for the reasons as to why Bukhārī avoided the transmission of a plethora of reliable transmitters in his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that Bukhārī transmitted ḥadīth through Muḥammad al-Bāqir, ‘Alī b. al-Ḥusain and many other relatives of the Prophet ﷺ, along with the fact that he included whole chapters that displayed the virtues of <em>Ahlulbait, </em>attest to the notion that Bukhārī had no theological bias against <em>Ahlulbait</em>, and that he was not a <em>Nāṣibī</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Bukhārī’s Transmission from Nāṣibī’s and Khārijtes</u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most flawed arguments/fallacies that may be presented in the context of ḥadīth sciences/transmission. Some Shias argue that the fact Bukhārī transmitted reports in his Ṣaḥīḥ through <em>Nāṣibīs</em>/<em>Khārijtes</em> such as: ‘Imran b. Hittan, Lumāzah b. Zabbār al-Azdī, Ḥusain b. Numair al-Wāsitī (etc.) entails that Bukhārī endorsed their theologies. However, this reasoning is very problematic: <u>simply transmitting a report through a transmitter does not entail an endorsement of his/her theology in any shape or form.</u> The biggest counter to this flawed argument is the fact that Bukhārī also transmitted reports in his Ṣaḥīḥ through many well-known Shi’ite/Rāfidhī transmitter ssuch as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>‘Abbād b. Ya’qūb</li>
<li>‘Abdulmalik b. A’yan (Zurārah’s brother)</li>
<li>‘Awf b. Abī Jamīlah</li>
<li>Sulaymān b. Qarm al-Ḍabbī</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be consistent in their reasoning, proponents of this argument are logically obligated to assert that Bukhārī was a Shi’ite/Rāfidhī as well, simply because he transmitted ḥadīths through some Shi’ite transmitters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, Bukhārī transmits reports in his Ṣaḥīḥ through tens of different transmitters whom Bukhārī vehemently disagrees with in theology, such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Qatādah b. Di’āmah (a <em>Qadarī</em>)</li>
<li>Abu Mu’āwiyah (a <em>Murji’</em>)</li>
<li>Hassān b. ‘Aṭiyyah (a <em>Qadarī)</em></li>
<li>Shabābah b. Sawwār (a <em>Murji’</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any reasonable individual would recognize that Bukhārī had transmitted reports in his book through many transmitters of different theological leanings, which he certainly did not endorse.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is evident that the arguments presented to justify the accusations against Bukhārī are flawed and contradictory in nature. The fact that Bukhārī did not include any reports through Ja’far in his book can be addressed with several points:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Bukhārī transmitted ḥadīth through Jafar’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather… along with many other transmitters from <em>Ahlulbait</em>.</li>
<li>Bukhārī, in his Ṣaḥīḥ<em>, </em>included several chapters that spanned tens of reports which display the virtues of many key individuals from <em>Ahlulbait</em>, such as: ‘Alī, Fāṭimah, al-Ḥasan, al-Ḥusain, Ja’far (etc.)</li>
<li>Bukhārī excludes the reports of many reliable transmitters for technical reasons/indicators that have nothing to do with his perception of those transmitters.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other flawed argument that Bukhārī was a <em>Nāṣibī</em> because he simply transmitted ḥadīth through <em>Nāṣibī</em> transmitters could also be addressed with the following points:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A simple transmission of ḥadīth through a transmitter does not entail an endorsement of his theology in any shape or form.</li>
<li>Bukhārī included Shi’ite/Rāfidhī transmitters in his Ṣaḥīḥ, along with many other transmitters of varying theological leanings.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a refutation to the main arguments produced by Olawuyi in his book “Did Abu Bakr really Lead the Salat?” The author’s main aim is to prove that all the narrations that suggest such are fabricated, that Abu Bakr was unqualified, and that even if he did lead it, it wouldn’t be a major merit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we have decided to specifically refute his main argument, which is that all the narrations that state that Abu Bakr was appointed to lead the prayer during the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – final illness are fabricated. The author’s main proof for this is that these narrations include contradictions in the details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are Contradictions between Narrations Proof that they are all fabricated?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simple answer is no.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Al-Tusturi states in his Risala fi Sahw Al-Nabi (p. 9), in response to one that made such claims, “This is an astounding claim for him to make, for the weakness of the report is proven by contradictions in the report itself, not from other reports.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusturi is correct. Contradicting reports are often due to the memories of narrators. In some cases, a contradiction between two reports may prove that one out of the two is a fabrication. However, to say that both reports are to be rejected and both are fabrications is not an academic approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusturi goes on, “If it is such as he claims, then Al-Salat Al-Wusta (2:238) should be attacked since the Ummah (nation) has disagreed on it, even though it is in the book (of Allah). Furthermore, there is not a single foundation (in religion) that does not include disagreement in its branches.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take for example the following scenario:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A robbery occurs in a nearby bank. A married couple witnesses the event from the street. The husband reports hearing two shots of gunfire as three men in black run out of the bank and get into their vehicle before escaping. The wife reports that she heard one shot and four men in navy blue ran out of the bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Does the judge take both their accounts into consideration, while weighing them out, or does he toss out the case and accuse them both of fabricating their own respective accounts?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is needless to say that hadith traditions works in a way that is similar to the real world, for inconsistencies between reports does not mean that they are manufactured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Appointment of Abu Bakr in Prayer is Mutawatir</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before dealing with the alleged contradictions, our first goal is to establish that the appointment of Abi Bakr in prayer is <em>mutawatir</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The appointment can be found in Saheeh Al-Bukhari through the hadith of A’isha and A’isha (664), Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari (678), and Abdullah bin Omar (682). It was also narrated in Saheeh Muslim through the hadith of Anas (419), and Ibn Abbas (418). This excludes other sources outside the Saheehain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also important to keep in mind that there are no narrations that contradict the actual appointment of Abi Bakr as an Imam for prayer, but rather, the contradictions revolve around the final prayer of the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; , in regards to which day did it occur, whether he led it or was led by Abi Bakr, and whether he prayed in those days or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, none of those details take anything away from what is agreed upon, which is that he appointed Abu Bakr as the Imam while he was sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Final Prayer of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below is a summary of the major details of the prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Narrations of Anas</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Abdul Aziz bin Suhaib from Anas &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – didn’t pray in public for the last three days. (Saheeh Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Al-Zuhri from Anas &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; didn’t pray, while Abu Bakr led while he was sick. (Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Humaid from Anas &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – prayed behind Abi Bakr. (Musnad Ahmad) This narration is weak, for Musnad Ahmad also included another narration that states that Humaid got this report from Thabit Al-Bunani, who said that he was told of this report, and he did not mention Anas. Al-Daraqutni in Al-Ilal also argues that Thabit did not get this narration from Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Narrations of A’isha</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Ubaidullah from A’isha &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – had Abu Bakr lead the prayers, except for one prayer where he led, and it was during Thuhur. (Bukhari and Muslim – This narration is corroborated by Ibn Abbas.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Al-Aswad from A’isha &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – appointed Abu Bakr to lead the prayer, however, he led himself during one prayer. (Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of ‘Asim from Abi Wa’il from Masrooq from A’isha &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – led one prayer, and Abu Bakr prayed behind him. (Saheeh Ibn Hibban)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration of Nu’aym from Abi Wa’il from Masrooq from A’isha &gt; The Prophet – peace be upon him – prayed behind Abi Bakr. (Saheeh Ibn Hibban)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above, we can come to the conclusion that there are no authentic narrations that state that the Prophet – peace be upon him – prayed behind Abi Bakr, except for the narration of Nu’aym, however, Asim narrates the same hadith and says the opposite. This is the correct opinion since it is supported by the narrations of Ubaidullah and Al-Aswad from A’isha.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, we come to the conclusion that the correct narrations of A’isha and Ibn Abbas affirm that Abu Bakr prayed one prayer behind the Prophet – peace be upon him – during the duration that he was sick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also find that one authentic narrations of Anas states that the Prophet – peace be upon him – didn’t pray any of the three days that he was sick. However, this was rejected by Al-Bayhaqi in Dala’il Al-Nubuwwa 7/195, who affirms that the prayer occurred on either a Saturday or a Sunday. This is rational conclusion, since the narration of A’isha mentions that this was during Thuhur, and Friday’s prayer is not referred to as the Thuhur prayer. The Prophet – peace be upon him – became sick on Thursday night and passed away before the Thuhur on Monday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This can be reconciled if we held the view that Anas was not present during Thuhur prayer on that day. A likelier possibility is that Abdulaziz bin Suhaib made a mistake since it contradicts all the other reports. Furthermore, the narration of Al-Zuhri from Anas makes no mention that the Prophet – peace be upon him – was absent during all three days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Responses to Alleged Contradictions</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before providing our responses to these alleged contradictions, it is important to be aware that much of these allegations are not actually contradictions, but rather, some narrations include more details than others, which the author has labeled as contradictions in order to tarnish the whole event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #1</strong>: The author said (p. 8), “One glaring omission from Anas’ reports is that of any explicit order from the Prophet concerning Abū Bakr’s leadership of ṣalāt. As such, we do not know – from Anas’ narrations – whether he led the Ṣaḥābah in ṣalāt from Thursday till Monday on the order of the Messenger of Allāh or not.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He goes on to add that the best that can be said is that there was a silent approval and no objection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response</strong>: The author quoted Anas on (p. 5) that: “The Prophet of Allāh, peace be upon him, gestured to Abū Bakr with his hand to lead.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #2</strong>: The author argues that Anas said that the Prophet – peace be upon him – in a report said that he didn’t pray in his last four days. (p. 5)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response:</strong> Refer to the previous section above about his last prayer – peace be upon him &#8211; .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradictions #3</strong>: The author lists a group of contradictions between Exhibit C and D (p. 13-14). However, the majority of these are not contradictions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response:</strong> Contradictions by definition are statements that oppose one another. The author, instead, provides examples of details that are found in one narration and not in the other and portrays them as contradictions. Take for example, one tradition states that the Prophet – peace be upon him – fainted, while the second doesn’t. This doesn’t mean that the narrators of the second report deny that he fainted, but rather, that the first narration shared more details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #4:</strong> The author argues that Exhibit D shows that the Prophet – peace be upon him – did not let Abu Bakr pray and that he interrupted him as soon as he prayed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response</strong>: Ibn Hajar comments on the report that says, “The narration appears to be referring to that very prayer, and it may be that this occurred later on, and that this information was dropped… and this is made clear by the narration of Musa bin Abi A’isha that is mentioned that Abu Bakr prayed those days.” In other words, the statement can be interpreted to reconcile this apparent contradiction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #5:</strong> The author said, “According to Exhibit C, the Messenger – on his order &#8211; was taken by two men to the side of Abū Bakr. But, in Exhibit D, the Prophet went to the left side of Abū Bakr by himself, with no support.“ (p. 14)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response:</strong> Exhibit D is clear that the feet of the Prophet – peace be upon him – are dragging across the ground and that he was not able to walk. The author’s biased understanding of the narration led him to the conclusion that the Prophet – peace be upon him – came to Abu Bakr on his own without support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #6</strong>: The author provides the hadith of Abdullah bin Zam’a as Exhibit E and the narration of A’isha as Exhibit F and attempts to show contradictions between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:  The narration of Ibn Zam’a was graded as weak by Sh. Shoaib Al-Arna’ut in his grading of the same hadith in Musnad Ahmad #18906. The narration is problematic due to it being narrated by Ibn Ishaaq who is a well-known <em>mudallis</em>. Sh. Shoaib argues that even though the hadith in Sunan Abi Dawud includes Ibn Ishaaq claiming that he heard the narration, the majority of the narrations from Ibn Ishaaq from reliable narrators are without this claim. Moreover, even if we were to accept that Ibn Ishaaq did hear the hadith, the narration would still only be of the <em>hasan</em> degree, for Ibn Ishaaq is not considered to be a “trustworthy”, but rather, an “acceptable” narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #7</strong>: The author, in order to provide weight to contradictions, quotes the following: “Al-Zuhrī (narrating from ‘Ubayd Allāh from ‘Āishah<u>)</u> reported: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said while he was (still) in the house of Maymūnah to ‘Abd Allāh b. Zam’a, “Tell THE PEOPLE to perform the ṣalāt .” So, he met ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭāb and said, “O ‘Umar! Lead the people in ṣalāt.” Therefore, he led them in ṣalāt. Then, the Messenger of Allāh, peace be upon him, heard his voice and recognized him, as he was someone with a loud voice. The Messenger of Allāh, peace be upon him, said, “Is that not the voice of ‘Umar?” They said, “Yes, it is.” He said, “Allāh the Almighty and the believers forbid that. Tell Abū Bakr to lead the people in ṣalāt.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response</strong>: The author is mistaken for including the name of Ubaidullah and A’isha between parentheses. The report is a disconnected report by Al-Zuhri. The author attempted to fill in the blanks by providing the previous chain. This was due to his ignorance in hadith sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contradiction #8: </strong>The author attempted to prove from pages 23-29 that there is a contradiction as to whether the Prophet – peace be upon him – or Abu Bakr led in his last prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response: </strong>Refer to the previous section above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Closing Comments</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author spent the rest of the book suggesting that Abu Bakr was not qualified to lead the prayer and that he was in the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/11/03/response-to-the-oppression-of-sayeda-faatima-s-a-part-iii/">army of Usama</a> and was not supposed to be in Madinah, while also downplaying the importance of the spiritual role of leading the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these points are simply refuting by the mere fact that the report that Abu Bakr was appointed to lead the prayer and that this is <em>mutawatir</em>, as proven in one of the earlier sections, so there is no need for a lengthy rebuttal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah &#8211; subhanahu wa ta’ala – have mercy on Abu Bakr Al-Sadeeq and may He turn his grave into a small piece of paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…<em>wal hamdu lillahi rabi al-aalameen.</em></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Meaning of Rijs in (33:33)</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those the Shias that have dared to ask themselves: “What does Rijs mean?” We decided to write up a short article that answers the question. Unlike <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/03/ayat-al-tatheer/">our previous article</a> that was a general refutation to the Shia understanding of the verse, in this article, we have decided to refute the Shia stance by quoting Ahlulbayt in an authentic Shia hadith in order to expose the extreme bias of Shias apologists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>The Misconception of Modern Shias</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, Shia apologists have made the mistake of assuming the meaning of Rijs due to their preconceptions. Below, we have included some of these assumptions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2163:ayah-al-muwaddah-a-new-analysis&amp;catid=169&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=115" rel="external nofollow">Guided</a> (Wilayat.net): Allah kept all <em>rijs</em> away from the Ahl al-Bayt (as). <em>Rijs</em> INCLUDES sin, IGNORANCE, mistake, error and all other negative attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://umar-ibn-khattab.blogspot.com/2013/11/fadak-inheritance-that-wasnt.html" rel="external nofollow">Umar-ibn-khattab blog</a>: Reading the verse of purity, and Hz Fatima&#8217;s (AS) inclusion in it, it can be concluded that she was pure from all rijs, all worldly and materialistic pleasures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://valiasr-aj.com/english/mobile_shownews.php?idnews=284" rel="external nofollow">ValiAsr-aj.com:</a> Allah only wishes to remove al-Rijs (evil deeds and sins, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/fadak/abu-bakrs-rejection-witnesses-testimony.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen.com</a>: In the verse under discussion, Allah (swt) makes it clear that the Ahl’ul bayt (as) are those individuals that are exempt from all forms of Rijs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meaning of Rijs According to Ahlulbayt</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon returning to Shia books of hadith, we found that Al-Rijs does not mean any of the general meanings that have been provided above. Ja’far Al-Sadiq explains, “<strong>Al-Rijs means doubts,</strong><strong> I swear by Allah that we never doubt in our Lord.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration can be found in Al-Kafi. It is the first hadith in the chapter entitled: The Chapter of the Appointment by Allah and His Messenger of the Imams (as) One by One.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration was graded as authentic by Al-Majlisi, Al-Khoei, and Al-Bahbudi.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;"></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: In the links above, one will find that the authors of the articles have included the term “uncleanliness” between parentheses. This cannot be found in the original Arabic, of course. We humbly suggest that they change the word between parentheses to “doubts” in order to fit in with the teachings of their “infallibles.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible Counter-Argument and Rebuttal</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Shia apologists might argue that the term Rijs encompasses all the meanings and should not be restricted to one meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Response: We strongly disagree with the suggestion, for there are no authentic narrations from Ahlulbayt that provide an alternative or a general meaning. Secondly, it is forbidden according to Shiasm for one to dismiss the specific interpretation of the Imam by turning a specific meaning into a general one. Nothing prevented the Imams from saying, “All sins / errors,” instead of “doubts&#8221; in the first place. So Shias should not put words into their mouths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Some Sunnis include a general meaning for Rijs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Response: Shias don’t take knowledge from Sunni books, especially in presence of the “authentic” narrations of “infallibles”. It is about time that Shias stop referring to Sunni books in order to affirm their own preconceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq, &#8220;removing Al-Rijs&#8221; has nothing to do with infallibility. Rather, it is a matter of having one&#8217;s doubts removed.</p>

<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;">The article contains three narrations from Imam Ahmad in which he comments on the narrations of Al-Manzila and Al-Ghadeer. </span></p>

<h2 class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;">Our response:</span></h2>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;">The comments of Imam Ahmad are not controversial at all. The only matter that we find problematic is the title that Master_IER chose for the article, since it suggests that Imam Ahmad forbade narrating these traditions. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="tm7">The most obvious response to this is that Imam Ahmad himself taught this hadith by documenting it in his Musnad many times. He quoted hadith Al-Ghadeer many times in Al-Musnad (#641, #950, #961, #1311, #3061, #18479, #19279, #19302, #19325, #19328, #22945, #23107, #23143, #23563). He did the same with Hadith Al-Manzila (#1463, #1490, #1505, #1509, #1532, #1547, #1583, #1600, #1608, #3061, #11272, #14638, #27081, #27467). We can find Imam Ahmad teaching these narrations at least </span><u><span class="tm8">sixty times </span></u><span class="tm7"> in his books. </span></span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="tm7">With this in mind, we come to the conclusion that Imam Ahmad’s words, “Leave it as it came,” must have a different meaning.</span><strong><span class="tm11"> It does not mean, “Don’t narrate it.”</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="tm7">In another context, Imam Ahmad uses the same words to describe some hadiths. Abu Bakr Al-Maruthi asked him about the narrations of the attributes of Allah, seeing Allah, the Isra’a, and the throne of Allah. Imam Ahmad graded them as authentic, then said,</span><strong><span class="tm11"> “The scholars have accepted them and we submit to these reports </span><u><span class="tm12">as they came.</span></u><span class="tm11">”</span></strong><span class="tm7"> (See Al-Sunnah by Al-Khallal ##283)</span></span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;">We understand from this that when Imam Ahmad says, “As it came,” or “leave it as it came,” then it means that he accepts the report and does not interpret it to hold any other meanings other than the apparent meaning. In other words, when speaking of the narrations of the merits of Ali, he is telling his students to accept the report as a merit of Ali, but to not interpret it or use it to suggest anything other than the apparent meaning. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm7" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm6" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="tm7">As we all know, Shias use these reports to suggest that the rightful successorship of Ali. Some go further to suggest that these refer to his infallibility. Neither of these two reports suggest this, but they </span><strong><span class="tm11">can</span></strong><span class="tm7"> be incorrectly interpreted to mean this. It is due to this that Imam Ahmad taught to accept these reports “as they came,” without the false interpretations. </span></span></p>

<h1 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Ashra Mubashra – Hadith Grading and Response to Doubts</span></strong></h1>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">In this article we will be taking a close look at the narration of the Ashra Mubashra in which the Prophet – peace be upon him – is said to have declared ten people as part of the people of Paradise. Below, we will be providing readers with a brief grading of the hadith as well as evidences for corroborating individual narrations that the men mentioned are indeed from the people of heaven according to the testimony of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . </span></p>

</ul>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<h2 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Grading of the Ashra Mubashra Hadith</span></strong></h2>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">The narration of the Ashra Mubashra has arrived us through multiple chains and through several companions. However, it is mainly attributed to Sa’eed bin Zaid. Perhaps the strongest narration is the narration by Humaid bin Abdulrahman in Sunan Al-Tirmithi #3681. The narration is not at the highest level of authenticity due to some weakness in a narrator named Musa bin Ya’qoub. He has been described as reliable by Ibn Ma’een and Ibn Adi. On the other hand, he was weakened by Ali bin Al-Madeeni and Imam Ahmad. Al-Nasa’ee says, “He is not strong.” (Refer to his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb.)</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">Another narration that has some strength is the narration of Al-Tabarani in Al-Kabeer #360 through <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2013/06/07/response-to-rafidi-companion-of-the-prophet-saw/" rel="external nofollow"><strong>Abu Al-Tufail</strong>.</a> It contains two narrators that have some weakness. The first is Thabit bin Al-Waleed, who has been slightly weakened by Ibn Hibban. The other is his father, Al-Waleed bin Abdullah bin Jumai’. He has been criticized by Al-Uqaili, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim, however, Imam Ahmad, Yahya, Abu Zur’ah, and Ibn Sa’ad had favorable opinions of him. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">Interestingly, there are several other narrators that have narrated this hadith from Sa’eed bin Zaid. There are the narrations of Abdulrahman bin Al-Akhnas (Sunan Abi Dawud #4031), Abdullah bin Thalim (Sunan Al-Tirmithi #3690), and Riyah bin Al-Harith (Sunan Ibn Majah #4031). All three of these students of Sa’eed bin Zaid are not known though.</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">Khaythama bin Sulaiman (#42) also narrates the hadith through Ziyad bin Ilaqa, yet it is weak as well. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">There are other chains, however, include major disconnections or liars. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6"> </span></strong></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Grading</span></strong><span class="tm8">: The first two narrations that we have first examined do have some weakness, but when combined with the three narrations that are attributed to anonymous students of Sa’eed bin Zaid, we can be certain that this narration was indeed said by Sa’eed himself. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6"> </span></strong></p>
<h2 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Who are the Ashra Mubashra Exactly?</span></strong></h2>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">It is important to keep in mind that some of the narrations include Sa’ad bin Malik instead of Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas. This is not a problem since Malik’s name is Abu Waqqas. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">The narrations mentioned above, do not include Abu Ubaida as one of the ten. It is only in the narration of Humaid bin Abdulrahman that we find the mentioning of Abu Ubaida. This is the view that was adopted by Imam Ahmad. He states in Kitab Al-Sunnah by Al-Khallal 1/286 that those promised paradise were nine, and that the Prophet – peace be upon him – is the tenth.</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">It is important to be aware that we do not mean by this that Abu Ubaida was not promised paradise. We only hold the opinion that he was not promised paradise in this specific hadith. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">It is known that Anas bin Malik narrated in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4031 that the Prophet – peace be upon him said – that “every nation has a trust man, and the trusted man of this nation is Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah.” This was also narrated by Huthaifa bin Al-Yaman in Al-Bukhari #4029. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">It is only reasonable to believe that one that is referred to as the “trusted man of this nation” is one who is guaranteed paradise. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<h2 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Can we accept a Narration in which the Narrator Praises Himself? </span></strong></h2>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">According to the rules of hadith sciences, the answer depends on the status of the narrator. If one who is unreliable narrates praise for himself, then it is not accepted. However, if one has been praised by others as being reliable, then his narration from the Prophet – peace be upon him – is accepted, even if the narration contains praise for himself. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">We have already mentioned in the past that Ali has quoted the Prophet’s – peace be upon him – praise for him tens of times in Kitab Al-Khasa’is by Al-Nasa’ee. Sunnis do not reject these hadiths because they contain self-praise. Rather, they are accepted, since Ali is a reliable narrator of hadith. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">The same applies to Sa’eed bin Zaid, who is a reliable narrator of hadith, as per the consensus of Sunni scholars.</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<h2 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Merits of the Ashra Mubashra</span></strong></h2>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">For the sake of the argument, even if we were to simply reject the narration, doing such does not serve Shias in the least. The narration of the Ashra is only one of many hadiths in which these men are praised by the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . Many of these narrations are very explicit, like the two narrations in the chapters of merits of the first three caliphs that have been accepted as authentic by scholars. The first is the famous narration of Anas in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #3423 in which he narrates that the Prophet – peace be upon him – was on top of Uhud along with Abu Bakr, Omar, and Uthman. Uhud then shook. The Prophet – peace be upon him – said: “O’ Uhud remain stable, for nothing is upon you other than a prophet, a </span><em><span class="tm9">siddeeq</span></em><span class="tm8">, and two </span><em><span class="tm9">shaheeds</span></em><span class="tm8">.” We can understand from the Qur’an and the Sunnah that those that are referred to as </span><em><span class="tm9">siddeeqeen </span></em><span class="tm8">and </span><em><span class="tm9">shuhada</span></em><span class="tm8"> are from the people of heaven.</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">The second narration, in Al-Bukhari #3419, from the narration of Abu Musa that the Prophet – peace be upon him – told Abu Musa to go to Abu Bakr, Omar, and Uthman and give them the good news that they are from the people of paradise.</span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Note</span></strong><span class="tm8">: Even though we have provided some of these merits above from Saheeh Al-Bukhari, we would like to assure our doubting Shia readers that these narrations can be found in several other sources as well. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<h2 class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="tm6">Conclusion</span></strong></h2>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">By skimming through works of hadith, we will also find explicit praise for the rest of the ten, as well as general merits for the Muhajireen in general, and those that participated in Badr and Hudaibiya. However, the above is sufficient to show that Shias do not have a case by attacking the hadith of the Ashra Mubashra. </span><span class="tm8">Rejecting the narration of the </span><span class="tm8">Ashra Mubashra is fruitless, unless one rejects all the authentic reports that praise the ten individually. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8">In other words, rejecting the narration of Sa’eed bin Zaid does not change the fact that these ten companions will remain reliable, respected, and adored by Sunnis, regardless as to whether the narration is authentic or not. </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal tm5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm8"> </span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Al Qunduzi Al Hanafi Exposed</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is without a doubt that one of the most commonly used sources in the world of Sunni-Shia polemics is Al-Qunduzi Al-Hanafi&#8217;s Yanabee&#8217; Al-Muwadda. This is not a surprise, since the book is attributed to a &#8220;Hanafi scholar&#8221; and contains narrations in which the Twelve Imams are appointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunnis correctly dismiss the book as unreliable. Not only is the author not known to the vast majority of Sunnis, but his time is too late, a whole millennium after the Golden Era of Hadith, for anyone to take him seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, dismissals like these were not accepted by Shias, who would insist that he was one of the greatest Hanafi scholars of all time, even though his Hanafi fiqh related works are virtually unknown to Shias.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/yanabi0011/" rel="attachment wp-att-3424 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3424 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0011-150x150.jpg" alt="yanabi0011" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0011-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0011-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0011-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0011-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>In any case, after a little digging through his book, we were able to find irrefutable proof that Al-Qunduzi took part in some foul play when compiling his book. He betrayed the trust of his readers as we shall soon demonstrate in the screenshots below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/yanabi0001/" rel="attachment wp-att-3428 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3428 alignright" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0001-150x150.jpg" alt="yanabi0001" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0001-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0001-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yanabi0001-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>In one of the most important chapters of the book, Al-Qunduzi states that he provides his narrations from Ghayat Al Maram. For those that are not aware, Ghayat Al-Maram was authored by Hashim Al-Bahrani, an extreme Akhbari Shia scholar. Through Ghayat Al-Maram, he quotes many narrations from various sources, including Fara&#8217;id Al-Simtain, Al-Arba&#8217;een by Abi Nu&#8217;aym, and others.</p>

He quotes around ten narrations from that one source. However, what we found peculiar is that the names of the teachers of Al-Khawarizmi were very familiar. Names like: Ahmad bin Mohammad bin Yahya Al-Attar, Mohammad bin Al-Hasan bin Al-Mutawakkil, and Al-Ja&#8217;afar bin Mohammad bin Masroor. These were the names of the teachers <strong>of the infamous Shia scholar Al-Saduq!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was then that we decided to return to Ghayat Al-Maram itself, to find the source of the confusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/ghayat/" rel="attachment wp-att-3423 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3423 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat-150x150.jpg" alt="ghayat" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/ghayat1/" rel="attachment wp-att-3425 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3425 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat1-150x150.jpg" alt="ghayat1" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat1-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat1-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat1-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>It was no surprise to find the narration of Al-Khawarizmi. However, there was only one narration by him, instead of ten! Hashim Al-Bahrani refers to it as an Aami (Sunni) source too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We could not find the other narrations that caught our interest in the same chapter. However, upon flipping over to the next chapter, which was exclusively for Shia reports, we found that Hashim Al-Bahrani was in fact quoting Al-Saduq.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was due to the grace of Allah &#8211; subhanahu wa tala &#8211; that we were able to find the exact same narrations that Al-Qunduzi was quoting. However, he deceived his readers by replacing the title and author of the book that he was quoting from, in order for Sunnis to accept his narrations. He repeats this offense with several narrations. Each time he replaced the name of Ibn Babawaih Al-Saduq with Al-Manaqib, alluding to Al-Khawarizmi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/ghayat2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3426 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3426 alignright" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat2-150x150.jpg" alt="ghayat2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat2-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat2-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat2-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/09/24/al-qunduzi-al-hanafi-exposed/ghayat3/" rel="attachment wp-att-3427 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3427 alignright" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat3-150x150.jpg" alt="ghayat3" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat3-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat3-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ghayat3-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>In conclusion, Al-Qunduzi was an deceiver. He is not reliable and his book should not been trusted as a source for hadith narrations. May Allah &#8211; subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala &#8211; punish him and whoever spreads falsehood in this life and in the hereafter.</p>
