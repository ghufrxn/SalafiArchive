<p style="text-align: justify;">In this topic we will see something related to the methodology of Shia scholars in their writings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin with the popular and controversial anti-Shia book &#8220;Lillah thumma Liltareekh&#8221; which is attributed to Sayyid Husayn al-Musawi, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is popular among us Shia is that `<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/09/18/abdullah-ibn-saba-the-book/" rel="external nofollow">Abdullah ibn Saba</a>&#8216; is an illusional character that isn&#8217;t real, a character invented by Ahlul-Sunnah to attack Shia beliefs, and they attributed to him that he created Tashayyu` so that people may turn away from the Madhab of Ahlul-Bayt.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happened next was that the Shia scholar `Ali Aal-Muhsin refuted the above book and wrote his own book calling it &#8220;Lillah wa Lilhaqiqah&#8221;. Aal-Muhsin in his book tried to expose the ignorance of the author of &#8220;Lillah thumma Liltareekh&#8221;, he wrote in refutation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is truly weird how a man who claims to be a Faqih and a Mujtahid is ignorant of such a simple Rijali matter, as it is well known and by consensus of Imami scholars and jurists, both the classical and contemporary ones, that `Abdullah ibn Saba&#8217; is a real character who is documented in Shia books of Rijal.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After this the author of &#8220;Lillah thumma Liltareekh&#8221; writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I have asked Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Aal-Kashif al-Ghata&#8217; about Ibn Saba&#8217;, he answered: &#8220;Ibn Saba&#8217; is a myth fabricated by Umayyads and `Abbasids who hated Ahlul-Bayt, the intelligent man must not waste his time with this personality.&#8221;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But `Ali Aal-Muhsin rejects this completely saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is popular among Shia scholars -including Kashif al-Ghata&#8217;- is that they believe in the existence of Ibn Saba&#8217;, who claimed divinity for Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen (as) so he burned him with fire along with his followers. This is known to anyone who searches in the books of Rijal and checks their condition.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the reader can see, Shia scholar `Ali Aal-Muhsin goes out of his way to prove that those who deny Ibn Saba&#8217; are ignorant, and that he is a real character and he was cursed by the Imams, he even says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We said previously: What is popular among Shia scholars, if not by consensus, is that `Abdullah ibn Saba&#8217; is a real person, not one of the great scholars denied him and their books are testimony to this. Based on this, everything that comes later is no more than a gross error, a great mistake, and this is the claim of that author who said that Shia scholars deny the existence of Ibn Saba&#8217;, this is not true as we clarified.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Shia scholars accept a matter or deny it, this is solely based on the benefit of their Madhab, this is why you will see them contradict themselves in their different books or sometimes even in the same book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We take their scholar `Ali Aal-Muhsin himself, who as you all saw above accepted Ibn Saba&#8217; as a real character so he can reach certain benefits (such as proving the ignorance of the opponent in Shi`ee literature). In another one of his books we will see that he shall deny the existence of Ibn Saba&#8217; for other benefits, he writes in his book &#8220;Kashf-ul-Haqa&#8217;iq Radd `ala  Hadhihi Nasihati&#8221; pg.230-233:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The fact that those historians ignored this man(Ibn Saba&#8217;) and the big role he played during the Fitnah and in changing Islamic history, is proof that he is a fabricated non-existent character.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then after showing four points to establish that Ibn Saba&#8217; is no more than a myth, he says in the same book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We conclude from these points, that Ibn Saba&#8217; is an illusionary character invented by Sayf ibn `Umar to defend `Uthman and to criticize `Ali and his Shia.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So ponder O reader about the ability of Shia scholars to write honestly and ponder on their motivations for writing whatever it is that they write.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, some of their scholars view Ibn Saba&#8217; as a blessing, such as Shaykh Muhammad `Ali al-Mu`allim , student of Ayatullah Muhammad al-Muraghi, he says in his book “`Abdullah ibn Saba’ al-Haqiqah al-Majhoulah” pg.62:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Everything Ibn Saba’ preached is truth, and it is the belief of Imami Shia, except his saying: “There were a thousand prophets and every prophet had a Wasi” because the narrations coming from the path of Ahlul-Bayt declare that prophets were more than a thousand.<br />
Nothing from which Ibn Saba’ mentioned shows signs of Ghulu or extremism, rather it appears that he was a Shia who belonged to Ahlul-Bayt and was loyal to Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen and disowned his enemies.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as lying is concerned, it is no secret that Shia scholars are some of the biggest liars, the likes of Milani and Kourani and Sharaf-ul-Deen al-Musawi. If this article were written to collect their lies it wouldn&#8217;t be an article rather a hundred volume book. Just as a benefit and although it is off topic, we list an obvious lie from one of the most renowned contemporary Shia scholars Ja`far al-Subhani, the purpose is to back up our previous words that Shia confirm and deny things solely based on benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ja`far al-Subhani writes in his book &#8220;Adwa&#8217; `ala `Aqa&#8217;id al-Shi`ah al-Imamiyyah&#8221; pg.528:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for other matters, such as cursing and insulting the Companions, or that they became apostates after the Prophet (saw) passed away, or that their narrations are unreliable, then these are nothing more than Umayyad Nasibi accusations. They accused the Shia of Aal-Muhammad (as) of these lies but they are innocent of them and Allah is surely the best judge.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet we all know he&#8217;s a liar because another renowned Shia scholar writes the exact opposite. Shaykh `Ali al-Namazi al-Shahroudi says in his book &#8220;Mustadrakat `Ilm-ul-Rijal&#8221; 1/67:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We conclude from the big quantity of narrations declaring that all companions are apostates except three or four, that the general rule for every companion who remained alive after the Prophet (saw) and did not become a martyr in his time, is that they are apostates for placing the non-chosen leader (means Abu Bakr) in authority over the chosen leader (means `Ali), or impious sinners for their short comings when it came to supporting him (`Ali), thus it is not possible to assume the reliability of any of them except through a specific divine text.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Hasan bin Baqir al-Najafi was the leader of the Shia in his time and sole Marji` of Taqleed they had, he wrote in his book &#8220;Jawahir-ul-Kalam&#8221; vol.6 pg.66:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What appears from the books of biographies and history is that many from the Companions, both during the time of the Prophet (saw) and after it, in addition to the people of Jamal and Siffeen, as well as all the people of Sham and the majority of the people of Madinah and Makkah, that they (all those mentioned) had extreme enmity towards Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen and his progeny (as). Although mixing with them and living among them was not rejected by the Shia even secretly, and so was the case when it came to Banu Umayyah and Banu al-`Abbas and their followers.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which means they&#8217;re Nawasib and we all know what the ruling of the Nasibi is according to the Twelver sect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another renowned Shia scholar Muhammad Baqir al-Waheed al-Bahbahani writes while talking about the beliefs of the Shia of the past, he writes in &#8220;Sharh Mafateeh-ul-Shara&#8217;i`&#8221; 2/36-38:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is apparent to us just as it was also apparent to Ahlul-Sunnah that they (past Shia) used to do Mut`ah with women and Mut`ah of Hajj and wipe on their feet during ablution, and curse the Shaykhayn(Abu Bakr &amp; `Umar) and the others (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) And they (past Shia) used to do this openly and not in private, so it wasn&#8217;t hidden from the `Aamah(Sunnies) let alone the Khaasah(Shia), even sending curses (on the Companions) which we previously mentioned, the little kids and the women from among the `Aamah(Sunnies) know with certainty that they (the past Shia) used to curse.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then we have al-Majlisi, who says in his book &#8220;Jala&#8217;-ul-`Uyoun&#8221; pg.45:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[There is no way for any sane man to doubt the disbelief of `Umar, so the curse of Allah and his Messenger be upon him and on anyone who considers him Muslim and anyone who doesn&#8217;t curse him.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Ayatullah al-Khu&#8217;i, he said in &#8220;Misbah al-Fuqaha'&#8221; 1/504-505:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We established from the narrations, the supplications and the Ziyaraat the permissibly of cursing those who oppose us(Sunnies), and the necessity of disowning them and to accuse them and curse them a lot and to backbite them since they are from the people of innovations and doubts. There is also no doubt about their disbelief, because denying the Wilayah (of `Ali) and even one of the Imams and believing in the Caliphate of others (etc&#8230;)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet after all this, Ja`far al-Subhani still insists in his book &#8220;Hiwar ma` al-Shaykh Salih bin `Abdullah al-Darwish&#8221; pg.105, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We the Shia do not accuse any Companion of disbelief, nor any of the Followers, nor any of the sects who testify to the three fundamentals: (Oneness of God, Final Message and Day of Judgment) This is the scale of faith and disbelief]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This topic of Takfeer is a huge one but what little we showed is sufficient to prove our point, that the people deny and confirm various matters based on the benefit of their sect and not out of honesty and truth. Do you see now dear reader, why many people are attracted to this sect and why many convert to Shiasm? Because they lie to them and those unsuspecting folks never imagine in their wildest imagination that bearded men of God, wearing turbans and traditional clothing, who claim to be followers of Muhammad (saw) and his household (as) could be compulsive liars!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait’s article entitled: “Taqayya of Ibn Umar.” The article was published on the 9th of June, 2012, and can be found <a href="http://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/taqayya-of-ibn-umar/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA quotes then comments:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Ibn ‘Umar reported: The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) said two rak’ahs at Mina, and Abu Bakr after him, and ‘Umar after Abu Bakr, and ‘Uthman at the beginning of his caliphate; then ‘Uthman observed four rak’ahs,and when Ibn ‘Umar prayed with the Imam, he said four rak’ahs, but when he observed prayer alone, he said two rak’ahs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">Similar narration is there in Musanif ibn abi sheebah Why was Ibn Umar offering two rakahs when alone? and four rakahs when with Uthman? When he knew that it was two rakahs????</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is as Ibn Umar said in an authentic narration in Sunan Abi Dawud at the end of this narration, which is that “disunity is bad.” Uthman was not a silly person to kill or hurt people who prayed a short prayer during travels. To suggest that taqiyyah prevented Ibn Omar from praying two prostrations is simply absurd and is free from evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khattabi comments after sharing the view that it is permissible to pray a full prayer (in four prostrations) even though it is preferred to pray in two: Don’t you see that Ibn Omar prayed the full prayer then said that this was because disunity is bad?! If praying a complete prayer was not permissible then disunity would have been good and not bad. See Ma’alim Al-Sunan 2/181.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For more on the concept of taqiyya in the eyes of Shias, refer to <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/taqiyya-the-other-face/" rel="external nofollow">Taqiyya: The Two-Faced Religion.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SoA quotes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">There is an interesting Narration in Urdu version of Musnad Ahmad, 5/92, Narration 11267, and It states</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #800000;"> حَدَّثَنَا إِسْحَاقُ بْنُ عِيسَى، حَدَّثَنِي حَمَّادُ بْنُ سَلَمَةَ، عَنْ بِشْرِ بْنِ حَرْبٍ، أَنَّ ابْنَ عُمَرَ، أَتَى أَبَا سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيَّ، فَقَالَ: يَا أَبَا سَعِيدٍ، أَلَمْ أُخْبَرْ أَنَّكَ بَايَعْتَ أَمِيرَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَجْتَمِعَ النَّاسُ عَلَى أَمِيرٍ وَاحِدٍ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، بَايَعْتُ ابْنَ الزُّبَيْرِ، فَجَاءَ أَهْلُ الشَّامِ، فَسَاقُونِي إِلَى حُبَيْشِ بْنِ دَلَجَةَ فَبَايَعْتُهُ، فَقَالَ ابْنُ عُمَرَ: إِيَّاهَا كُنْتُ أَخَافُ، إِيَّاهَا كُنْتُ أَخَافُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #800000;"> Ibn Umar came to Abu Sa’eed and asked Him that I have heard that You have done Bay’at of Two Amirs before Nation could gather on One? He replied: Yes, I had done Bay’at of Ibn Zubair, but then People of Syria came and took me by force to Army of Ibn Dalja, so I had to give Bay’at. Ibn Umar said: I fear this, I fear this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brother Hani explained in a previous article, based on the book of Faysal Noor, that taqiyyah is permissible in the eyes of Ahl Al-Sunnah in matters of life and death. Refer to that article <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/1184/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Even though we do not have an issue with such a concept, we would like to make it known that the above narration is weak because of Bishr bin Harb. He was weakened by Ibn Al-Madeeni, Yahya bin Sa’eed, Ahmad, Ibn Ma’een, Ibn Sa’ad, Sulaiman bin Harb, Abu Dawud, Al-Ijli, Al-Uqaili, Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim, Ibn Khirash, and Ibn Hibban. See Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb 1/226.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Taqiyya in the tongue of the Arabs means to fear or to be cautious or wary of something, in order to protect oneself from it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Imam ibn Hajar (rah) says in &#8220;Fath-ul-Bari&#8221; 19/398:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is to be wary from exposing what is concealed in oneself -such  as the belief- from others]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taqiyya in the religion of Islam is permissible because of these two verses:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sura 3 Verse 28:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation of Arberry:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends, rather than the believers &#8212; for whoso does that belongs not to God in anything &#8212; unless you have a fear of them. God warns you that You beware of Him, and unto God is the homecoming.}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation of Pickthall:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless (it be) that ye but guard yourselves against them, taking (as it were) security. Allah biddeth you beware (only) of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying.}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sura 16 Verse 106:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation of Arberry:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Whoso disbelieves in God, after he has believed &#8212; excepting him who has been compelled, and his heart is still at rest in his belief &#8212; but whosoever&#8217;s breast is expanded in unbelief, upon them shall rest anger from God, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement;}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translaion of  Pickthall:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief &#8211; save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith &#8211; but whoso findeth ease in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom.}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TAQIYYA ACCORDING TO THE SCHOLARS OF ISLAM:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Imam al-Qurtubi (rah) in his book &#8220;Tafseer al-Qurtubi&#8221; lists three opinions while commenting on those verses:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Mu`adh ibn Jabal and Mujahid both said: Taqiyya was at the beginning when Islam was not yet strong, but today Allah strengthened this religion so that they may not practice Taqiyya  with their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Abdullah ibn `Abbas said: It is to utter (Kufr) with the tongue while the heart is at peace with the faith. However, it is not permissible to kill or commit sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Hasan al-Basri said: Taqiyya is permissible until the day of judgement but one may not kill.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was said that, if the believer is residing between disbelievers, and if he fears for his life from them, then he can humor them with his tongue but his heart must be comfortable and content with the Islamic faith. Taqiyya is not permissible except from fear of being killed, or greatly harmed (i.e having the limbs cut). As for the one who is forced to commit an act of Kufr, the correct opinion is that he can disobey and avoid uttering any words of Kufr.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Imam ibn Kathir (rah) expands on this in his book &#8220;Tafseer ibn Kathir&#8221; while commenting on the same verses:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[{except one who was forced while his heart is at peace with the faith} This is an exception in the case of one who utters statements of disbelief and verbally agrees with the polytheists because he is forced to do so by the beatings and abuse to which he is subjected, but his heart refuses to accept what he is saying, and he is, in reality, at peace with his faith in Allah and His Messenger . The scholars agreed that if a person is forced into disbelief, it is permissible for him to either go along with them in the interests of self-preservation, or to refuse, as Bilal did when they were inflicting all sorts of torture on him, even placing a huge rock on his chest in the intense heat and telling him to admit others as partners with Allah. He refused, saying, “He is One, One.” And he said, “By Allah, if I knew any word more annoying to you than this, I would say it.” May Allah be pleased with him. Similarly, when the Liar Musaylimah asked Habib bin Zayd Al-Ansari, “Do you bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah” He said, “Yes.” Then Musaylimah asked, “Do you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah” Habib said, “I do not hear you.” Musaylimah kept cutting him, piece by piece, but he remained steadfast insisting on his words. It is better and preferable for the Muslim to remain steadfast in his religion, even if that leads to him being killed, as was mentioned by Al-Hafiz Ibn `Asakir in his biography of `Abdullah bin Hudhafah Al-Sahmi, one of the Companions. He said that he was taken prisoner by the Romans, who brought him to their king. The king said, “Become a Christian, and I will give you a share of my kingdom and my daughter in marriage.” `Abdullah said: “If you were to give me all that you possess and all that Arabs possess to make me give up the religion of Muhammad even for an instant, I would not do it.” The king said, “Then I will kill you.” `Abdullah said, “It is up to you.” The king gave orders that he should be crucified, and commanded his archers to shoot near his hands and feet while ordering him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then the king gave orders that he should be brought down, and that a big vessel made of copper be brought and heated up. Then, while `Abdullah was watching, one of the Muslim prisoners was brought out and thrown into it, until all that was left of him was scorched bones. The king ordered him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then he ordered that `Abdullah be thrown into the vessel, and he was brought back to the pulley to be thrown in. `Abdullah wept, and the king hoped that he would respond to him, so he called him, but `Abdullah said, “I only weep because I have only one soul with which to be thrown into this vessel at this moment for the sake of Allah; I wish that I had as many souls as there are hairs on my body with which I could undergo this torture for the sake of Allah.” According to some reports, the king imprisoned him and deprived him of food and drink for several days, then he sent him wine and pork, and he did not come near them. Then the king called him and asked him, “What stopped you from eating” `Abdullah said, “It is permissible for me (under these circumstances), but I did not want to give you the opportunity to gloat.” The king said to him, “Kiss my head and I will let you go.” `Abdullah said, “And will you release all the Muslim prisoners with me” The king said, “Yes.” So `Abdullah kissed his head and he released him and all the other Muslim prisoners he was holding. When he came back, `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, “Every Muslim should kiss the head of `Abdullah bin Hudhafah, and I will be the first to do so.” And he stood up and kissed his head. May Allah be pleased with them both.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we conclude so far, is that the Muslim is allowed to hide his faith and even show disbelief if he fears great harm, but it is more noble and much greater in the sight of God, if one were to die for his belief for the sake of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh al-Maududi (rah) also wrote in commentary to these verses in &#8220;Tafheem ul-Qur&#8217;an&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This verse deals with the case of those Muslims who were being persecuted with cruelty and were being-subjected to unbearable torments to force them to give up their Faith. They are being told that if at any time they are forced to utter words of disbelief to save their lives, when in fact in their hearts they are secure against disbelief, they will be pardoned. On the other hand, if they accepted unbelief from the core of their hearts, they shall not escape the torment of Allah even if they succeed in saving their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It does not, however, mean that one should utter words of disbelief to save one’s life. This is merely a permission but not the ideal thing for a Believer. According to this permission if one utters such a thing, he shall not be taken to account. In fact, the ideal for a Believer is to utter words of truth in any case whether his body is cut into pieces. There are instances which show that during the period of the Holy Prophet some acted upon the ideal while others took advantage of the permission. There was Khabbab bin Art (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made to lie on embers of fire until the fire was extinguished by the melting of his fat, but he remained firm in his Faith. Then there was Bilal Habashi (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made to put on an armor and stand in the scorching heat. Then he was dragged on the burning sand but he went on saying, “Allah is one.” There was another Believer, Habib Gin Zaid bin `Asim, whose limbs were cut one by one by the order of Musailimah, the Liar. Each time his limb was severed it was demanded of him that he should acknowledge the Liar as a prophet but each time he refused to bear witness to his claim of prophethood until he breathed his last. On the other hand, there was the instance of Ammar bin Yasir (May Allah be pleased with him) whose parents were mercilessly butchered before his eyes. After this he himself was put to such unbearable torture that, in order to save his life, he had to utter the same words of unbelief that were demanded of him. Afterwards when he came crying to the Holy Prophet, he said, “O Messenger of Allah, they did not let me go until I spoke evil of you and praised their deities” . The Holy Prophet asked him, “How do you feel about this, in your heart?” He replied humbly, “My heart is fully convinced of the Faith.” At this the Holy Prophet replied, “If they put you to the same torture again, you may utter the same words”.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we see from the words of the noble scholars of Islam, Taqiyya is practiced with the enemies from the Kouffar in order to protect oneself from death or great harm! On the other hand, a Twelver Imami Shia will also make a similar claim, he will say that Taqiyya in his religion is also a means to avoid death in extreme cases&#8230; but is this true? or is the Shia lying and practicing his own deceptive version of Taqiyya?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TAQIYYA IN THE SHIA RELIGION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin by quoting the leaders of the Twelver Shia faith from their own books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1) </strong>Shaykh al-Saduq, ibn Babawayh al-Qummi in his “al-I`tiqadat” (p 114) said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our belief regarding Taqiyya is that it is obligatory. He who leaves it is like he who leaves praying, and it’s impermissible to dismiss it until the Mahdi rises, he who leaves it before al Mahdi rises has left the religion of Allah and the religion of Imami Shia and has disobeyed Allah and the Prophet and the Imams.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2)</strong> As quoted from “Bihar al Anwar” 75/421 and “Mustadraq Safeenat al-Bihar” 10/416, the author of al-Hidayah says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Taqiyya is obligatory and it’s impermissible to leave it until the Mahdi rises and he who left it has broken the rule of Allah and his Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wa ali) and the Imams (alaihuma salam).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 3)</strong> `Abbas al Qummi said in “Al Kuna wal Alqab” 1/141:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Taqiyya is an obligatory act upon us in the government of oppressors -he means Sunni Islamic Caliphate- and he who leaves it has left the religion of Imami Shia and strayed away from it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4)</strong> In “Mir&#8217;at al-Anwar” (p 337), al`Amili says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The clear authentic and mass transmitted (Mutawatir) narrations prove that Taqiyya shall remain until the Mahdi rises.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5)</strong> al-Khomayni said in “Al Makasib al Muharramah” (2/162):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Leaving Taqiyya is a sin which can lead to the bottom of hell and is equal to rejecting the prophet-hood and Allah.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However he contradicted himself in another location, when Khomayni wished to overthrow the king of Iran, he ordered his followers to stop practicing Taqiyya and to fight against the ruler of Iran, this is documented in many locations such as &#8220;al-Taqiyya fil-Fikr al-Islami&#8221; p.103 and &#8220;Durous fil-Jihad wal-Rafd&#8221; p55-58.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khomayni said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Taqiyya is Haram and exposing the truth is obligatory no matter what the price.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khomayni also contradicted himself and the early scholars for political purposes when he said in &#8220;Tahreer al-Wasilah&#8221; issue #2792:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is a disgrace to remain silent in such conditions, and to display cowardice in front of the oppressors who wish to harm the honor of the human and the Qur&#8217;an and the eternal Islamic laws. Rise and revolt and struggle and reform!]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6)</strong> While Khomayni is speaking about the various types of Taqiyya in &#8220;al-Rasa&#8217;il&#8221; 2/174, he explains the “Mudaratiyah Taqiyya”:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is the act of making those who differ with us – Ahlul sunnah – love us and to lure them by friendliness in a situation where there is no fear of harm or damage -to the shia- unlike the Taqiyya of fear.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7)</strong> al-Khomayni continues in &#8220;al-Rasa&#8217;il&#8221; 2/201 by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Taqiyya is wajib (obligatory) with those who differ with us -Ahlul Sunnah- even if there is no fear on oneself or on someone else’s.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8)</strong> al-Shirazi said in “al Qawa`id al Fiqhiyah” 1/410:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The Purpose of Taqiyya is not limited to preserve one’s self and to repel harm and danger from the self and the family and the wealth. It can also be to preserve the unity of the Muslims in situations where there is no need to reveal the true beliefs or defend them. It can be for other purposes as well, like spreading the message in a better way…]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically what their leader al-Shirazi is saying, is that they’ll lie in order to get close to you, and when they earn your trust they&#8217;ll begin spreading their message and bit by bit you’ll start doubting your religion and then you can easily be converted to Shia faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9)</strong> Muhsin al-Hakeem said in &#8220;al-Mustamsak&#8221; 2/410:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: The duty is to humor them (The Sunnies) and keep up with them, it is forbidden to leave this, so that they may not become aware of the differences]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he said on pg.332:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What we benefit from the narrations of Taqiyya is that they were legislated so that the Shia may hide from their opponents, and so that they may not be known for their Shiasm and Rafidhism]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We conclude from this, that they know for a fact that they are Rafidhah who curse and insult the companions, they only hide this to be on our good side and later convert us to their faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10)</strong> Muhammad Sadiq al-Roohani in his book &#8220;Fiqh al-Sadiq&#8221; 11/418, he says about the Imam Ja`far:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We conclude from this, that Taqiyya is his (Ja`far&#8217;s) religion and that of his fathers, and it is to conceal our ways from the opponents, and to try and spread them in secret. It is necessary to preserve the religion (Shiasm) and its followers, also spreading it depends on this.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF TAQIYYA IN SHIA FAITH:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The Shia have narrated in their books that the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wa ala alihi wa sallam) said:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Taqiyya is from the religion of Allah and there is no religion for he who has no Taqiyya, By Allah if it weren’t for Taqiyya then Allah would not be worshiped.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10)</strong> Shia scholar Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his “`Aqa&#8217;id-ul-Imamiya” in chapter 33 “Doctrine of Dissimulation (Taqiyya)” said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It is related from Imam al-Sadiq in an authenticated tradition: “Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my forefathers. Whosoever has no Taqiyya has no religion.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11)</strong> And they narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Taqiyya is from the religion of Allah”, I asked: “From the religion of Allah?” He said: “Yes by Allah, it is from the religion of Allah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 75/425, “al Kafi” 2/217 (Majlisi said it’s Muwaththaq), “Mishkat al Anwar” p43.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>12)</strong> And from their book “Mishkat al Anwar fi Ghurar al Akhbar” chapter #11:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They narrated that Imam al-Sadiq reported on the authority of his father: “I swear by God that there is nothing on the Earth dearer to me than Taqiyya, my darling. God will raise the status of whomever practices Taqiyya, and God will abase whoever does not.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13)</strong> Also in the same book and chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In &#8220;al-Taqiyya&#8221; by al-`Ayyashi it is narrated that Imam al-Sadiq said: “There is no religion for he who has no Taqiyya. And indeed the practice of concealing faith is wider than whatever exists between the Heavens and the Earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14)</strong> And again from the same source:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam al-Sadiq said: “Whoever believes in God and the Resurrection, shouldn&#8217;t talk in the unjust government except by Taqiyya.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comment: By &#8220;unjust government&#8221; he means any land ruled by non-Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>15)</strong> And they have narrated from their Imam:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Allah forgives all sins for the believers in this world and the hereafter except for two: Leaving Taqiyya and wasting the rights of his brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16)</strong> Shaykh as-Saduq in his book “al-Hidayah”, under the chapter of “Taqiyya” wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is related from as-Sadiq that he was asked about the saying of Allah (swt), {Verily the most noble of you with Allah is the most fearing}. He said “The one from you who most practices Taqiyya.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he wrote several narrations such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (The Imam) said, “Mix with the people (Sunnies) on the outside, and oppose them on the inside, so long as the affair (Of the Mahdi)  is longing.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (The Imam) said, “Ostentation (Riya&#8217;) with the hypocrite in his house is worship, and with the believer, is shirk.”<br />
Taqiyya is obligatory; it is not allowed to abandon it until the Qa&#8217;im (Mahdi) comes forth. Whoso abandons it has entered in the interdiction of Allah, `azza wa jalla, and the interdiction of His Messenger and the Imams, the blessings of Allah be upon them all.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>17)</strong> And they have narrated from imam al-Rida:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There is no religion for he who has no piety and no belief for he who has no Taqiyya. The kindest amongst you in the sight of Allah are those who practice Taqiyya the most.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;(On the day of judgment) The man from our Shia who was very negligent in his worship of Allah shall be brought forward, but since he has the belief in Wilayah and he has the Taqiyya and he preserved the rights of his brothers.

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Who is better, us or the companions of the Mahdi? He said: You are better than the companions of al-Mahdi because you wake up and sleep in fear for your Imam from the tyrant rulers. If you pray then you pray in Taqiyya and if you fast then your fasting is in Taqiyya and if you make pilgrimage then you make it in Taqiyya … I said: Then why do we wish for the Mahdi to appear? He said: Subhan Allah don’t you wish for justice and that the oppressed be saved?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;He who leaves Taqiyya before our Qa&#8217;im (Mahdi) rises then he isn&#8217;t from us.&#8221;</p>

The Shia Mahdi himself is shrouded with Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In “Qawaid al-fiqhiya” by Nasir Shirazi (1/497, for hadith see “Wasael al Shia” 11/487) written:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Abdullah al Salihi said: Our companions asked me after Imam Abu Muhammad (alaihi salam) had left. They asked me about the name and the location and the answer was: If you tell the name then they’ll spread it and if they know the location they will tell on him(reveal him).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it was narrated that one of the emissaries, Muhammad ibn Uthman al-Umari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You saw the successor?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes, By Allah&#8221; – until he was asked &#8211; And his name? He said: &#8220;It is forbidden for you to ask for his name and I don’t say this from my own mind because it is not my place to say what is Haram and Halal, but that’s (only) from him (to say) peace be upon him. The Sultan thinks that abu Muhammad al Imam al Askari (alaihi salam) had died without a son – until he said- And if you mention a name then they will ask for him so fear Allah and refrain from it.<br />

Ali ibn Asim al-Kufi said:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And from Muhammad ibn Uthman al-Umari:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A writing that I am familiar with says: “He who calls me by my name between a group of people then the curse of Allah be on him.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Qawa’ed al Fiqhiyah” 1/495,499, “Wasael al Shia” 11/489.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But let&#8217;s not get derailed, we go back to the narrations of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>33)</strong> They narrated from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Do Taqiyya for he is not from among us who does not make it his slogan and habit with those who are closest to him, so that he can later use it against those he fears.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 72/395, “Al Amali” p293, “Wasael al Shia” 11/466, “Mustadrak Safeenat al Bihar” 10/415.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>34)</strong> They also narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Make Taqiyya in situations where there shouldn&#8217;t be Taqiyya.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Fiqh al redah” p338, “Bihar al anwar” 75/347.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So in brief the rules of Taqiyya in the religion of the Twelver Shiites are completely and utterly different than those of the traditional correct Islamic Taqiyya. The true Muslim scholars permitted this practice when one is surrounded by disbelievers, those who seek your blood or when your family is in extreme danger. In such cases it’s permitted to hide your Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EXAMPLES OF SHIA NARRATIONS THAT THEY CLAIM ARE TAQIYYA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you would see few samples from a huge ocean of Shia narrations in which they claim their imams to be doing Taqiyya and concealing the truth. It’s up to you to judge if these are indeed life threatening situations? You’ll also see how the Shia scholars pick and choose the narrations which contradict with their own beliefs and pass them off as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1)</strong> Narrated ar-Rida from his fathers:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While explaining the verse {Then on that Day, you will be asked concerning pleasure}[Al Takathur:8] Ali ibn Abu Talib said: It’s al Rutab(Dates) and cold Water”.<br />
Shia giant scholar of hadith Muhammad Baqir al Majlisi said: Maybe this could be considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al Anwar 7/273.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One has to ask himself what type of life threatening situation was caliph `Ali (ra) or Imam al Rida (rah) in which would push them to  lie about something so insignificant and minor? Would they have been killed if they didn’t say dates and cold water?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2)</strong> And again from him:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Eve is created from the liver of Adam, in another narration: from the side of Adam while he was asleep”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allamah Majlisi says: This News is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al Anwar 11/116, 222.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who would have harmed him if he were to say otherwise? What is the need for Taqiyya here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3)</strong> And they narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Adam (as) descended in India”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scholar al Majlisi says: We can consider this narration as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 11/180, 213.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s the purpose of telling people that Adam (as) descended in India? Did al-Sadiq say this while being chased by an angry mob of Indians? Why use Taqiyya to tell people something like this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4)</strong> And they narrated that Tawus al-Yamani asked the Imam:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Do you know in which day a third of humanity died? He replied: O Abu AbdurRahman, a third of humanity never died but a quarter of humanity died. He said: How’s that? Imam said: It was Adam and Eve and Qabil and Habil, Then Qabil killed Habil so it was one fourth of humanity”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: The Fact that he never mentioned their sisters is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 11/230.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can anyone explain why he used Taqiyya here? What’s the danger?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5)</strong> And they have narrated from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ismail (as) died at 130 years of age”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: This news is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 12/113.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Would they have killed him if he were to say 129 years?  or 131? Why do Taqiyya in this situation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6)</strong> In some narrations the Imams mentioned that the sacrificed son of Ibrahim (as) is Isaac and not Ismail (as) so al Majlisi said: We can consider these narrations as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar Al Anwar” 12/135.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Ahlul-Sunnah differed in this matter and no one got killed for it, no one had to hide his beliefs and lie to save his life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7)</strong> The Shia  narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Al Baqir (as) said: Yahya (as) was the son of Mariam’s Aunt (from her Mother’s side)”.<br />
Majlisi said: Maybe this is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al Anwar 14/202.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Other Narrations, That Mariam (as) was the sister of Yahya’s (as) Mother, and one of these can be considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Mustadrak Safeenta al bihar” 4/268.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8)</strong> And from al-Baqir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Baqir (as) said: The Day of Ashura is the day when Isa bin Mariam (as) was born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi: This can be Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 14/215.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who would kill him or harm him for saying something like this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9)</strong> And Majlisi also said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All narrations which state that the man whom Allah had put to death for a hundred years is `Uzayr , are considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 14/378.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10)</strong> And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrations which differ regarding the period of time that Yunus spent in the belly of the whale some of them can be considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 14/401.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11)</strong> And they narrated in a long hadith from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wa ali) went to the house of Zayd to ask for him so he saw Zaynab sitting in her room preparing food. He opened the door and looked at her and she was beautiful, so the prophet (saw) said: “Subhan Allah the creator of Noor and Tabarak Allahu, (who is) the best of creators”. Then he went back home and Zaynab was in his heart…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi said: Maybe this is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 22/216.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to this, the Imam is tarnishing the reputation of the prophet (saw) and spreading filthy rumors as Taqiyya? Just to save his life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>12)</strong> And they narrated that when `Ali (alaihi salam) was asked about the days and what actions are permitted in each one, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Saturday is a day of scheming and trickery, Sunday is a day of planting and building, Monday is a day of traveling and seeking”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider what came on Monday as Taqiyya and this is the opinion of sheikh al Amili.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 59/23.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13)</strong> In another narration the Imam compliments Monday so Majlisi says that this is done as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al anwar” 59/52, 62/138.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14)</strong> In another narration Imam Musa al Kadhim criticizes the day of Nawrouz. So al Majlisi says he did so out of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al anwar 59/101.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>15)</strong> And they narrated from Abul Hasan:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Mousoukh -Humans who transformed to beasts- are twelve kinds. The elephant was a king of adultery who was a homosexual, the bear was a corrupt wondering Arab, the rabbit is a woman who is betraying her husband, the bat used to steal other people’s dates … The flower used to be a woman who made fitnah with Haroot and Maroot, the pigs and monkeys are a people of Bani Israel who transgressed on a saturday … The scorpion is a man who talks about others behind their back”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Some of these can be Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 65/221</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16)</strong> And they narrated that ibn Kawa asked Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I found a dead chicken and an egg came out of it, can I eat it? Ali said: No”.<br />
Al Majlisi: Impermissibility can be attributed to Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 66/50.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>17)</strong> In some narrations the Imam criticizes meat, al Majlisi says: All narrations criticizing meat are Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al anwar” 66/57,70.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>18)</strong> Mouwafaq the Mawla (Servant) of Abu al Hassan said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Out of all plants he used to tell us to have lots of Jarjeer (Plant like Mint commonly known as rocket or arugula)”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi says: it’s possible this is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 66/237.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the imam starts telling his followers to eat lots of Jarjeer, why should we consider this Taqiyya? What life threatening situation makes him claim that eating lots of Jarjeer is good for us? Was Yazeed Pro-Jarjeer? Nonsense!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>19)</strong> And they have narrated from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Three breaths while drinking are better than one breath”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Majlisi said: Maybe the multitude (of breaths) is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 66/463.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>20)</strong> Sadiq was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If a woman has Janabah does she need to do Ghusl from it if a man didn&#8217;t release in her?&#8221; He said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Al Amili says: We can consider this Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” by al Hurr al Amili 2/192.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>21)</strong> And al-Baqir was describing Ghusl:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Wash your palms and your sexual organ and make ablution like that of prayer then wash up”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh al Amili says: This is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” 2/247.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>22)</strong> And from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If you make ablution then wipe your feet from the bottom and top”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh al Shia al Tusi said: This news is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Tahtheeb” 1/92, “Al Istibsar” by Tusi 1/61,62, “Wasael al Shia” 1/415.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>23)</strong> And they narrated from `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I sat to make ablution and the prophet (saw) came when I started -until he said- He told me: O Ali wipe between your toes”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh al Tusi said: This narration is one of Taqiyya because it agrees with the mainstream Muslims (Sunnies).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Tahtheeb” 1/93, “al Istibsar” 1/66, “Wasael al Shia” 1/421.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>24)</strong> And they narrated that as-Sadiq was asked about the man who wipes his face with a small towel, he said: No problem with that. In another narration that as-Sadiq made ablution then wiped his face with the bottom of his clothes and said “Do this because it’s what I do”.<br />
Al Amili and al Majlisi said: We can consider these narrations as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 80/331, And Amili said the same in “Wasael al Shia” 1/475.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>25)</strong> And from al-Kadhim:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The prophet (saw) said: Open your eyes during ablution so that they may not see the fire. In another narration: Let your eyes contact water (during ablution).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: It’s not unlikely that these two reports are Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 80/337.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>26)</strong> And they narrated that al-Kadhim was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“About a man who made ablution but forgot to wash his left, he said: He washes his left only and does not repeat the entire ablution”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Maybe this is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 80/358.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>27)</strong> And they narrated from `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A woman in her period does not make prostration if she hears the verses of prostration”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: What’s apparent is that this is Taqiyya, and this is what shaykh al-Amili also said, because the majority of mainstream Muslims forbade it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 81/118, “Wasael al Shia” 2/342.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>28)</strong> When as-Sadiq was asked about Tayamum, he replied:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He placed his hand on the floor and then wiped his face and his arms until the elbows”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh al Tusi said: This is Taqiyya because it agrees with the Madhab of the mainstream muslims, sheikh al-Amili said the same.<br />
Source: “Al Istibsar” 1/170, Al Amili said the same in “Wasael al Shia” 3/362,365.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>29)</strong> And from al-Baqir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The most deserving person to pray upon the woman when she dies is her husband”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: The narrations which state that the brother is more deserving than the husband are Taqiyya and this is the opinion of sheikh Tusi, because it agrees with the madhab of the mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 81/346, “Al Tahtheeb” 3/205, “al Istibsar” 1/487, “Wasael al Shia” 3/116.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>30)</strong> And they narrated that the prophet (saw) said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Don’t pray twice on Janazah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and al Majlisi said: The news of impermissibility are considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 81/350, “Wasael al Shia” 3/87.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>31)</strong> They narrated that as-Sadiq disliked praying upon the deceased when the sun is yellow and when it rises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh Tusi said: It’s disliked because it can be the Madhab of some mainstream Muslims, so he made Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Tahtheeb” 3/321, “Al Istibsar” 1/470, “Wasael al Shia” 3/109.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>32)</strong> And they narrated that after as-Sadiq explained how to perform funeral prayer, he said: “And if you’re done then you make Tasleem on your right”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At-Tusi said: When he said that you make Tasleem on your right after you’re done he did Taqiyya because it agrees with the Madhab of the mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Tahtheeb” 3/192, “Al Istibsar” 1/478.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>33)</strong> And they have narrated from as-Sadiq, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no prayer after `Asr until you pray the Maghrib, and no prayer after Fajr until the sun rises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh at-Tusi said: These narrations and the ones similar to them are considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Istibsar” 1/291.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>34)</strong> And they narrated from Sama`ah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said to Abu Abdullah (as) regarding Maghrib: We pray it but fear that the sun could be hidden behind a mountain or is concealed by one. He replied: You don’t have to climb the mountain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and al Majlisi said: It’s best to consider this Taqiyya.<br />
Source: “Wasael al Shi”a 4/198, “Bihar al Anwar” 83/85.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>35)</strong> And they narrated from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He who delays Maghrib prayer until the stars appear without an excuse then by Allah I have nothing to do with him”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider this from Taqiyya as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 83/60.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>36)</strong> They narrated from Abu Arandas:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That he saw al Kadhim (as) during Ramadan when the caller (to prayer) was calling: &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;, his servant poured him a drink and he drank it”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider this Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 83/62.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SubhanAllah! Where bani Umayyah waiting for him to drink so they can execute him or arrest him!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>37)</strong> From Zurarah:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I saw Al Baqir and As Sadiq when they raise their heads from the second prostration; they stand back up and don’t sit in a position of Joulous”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Al Amili says: We can consider this to be Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” Al Hurr al amili, 6/346.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>38)</strong> Narrated Zurarah and Abi Hamza from al Baqir in a Hadith of ablution:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">… “And he dipped his hand in the water container and he wipes on his head and feet”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Dipping the hand in a water container to wipe, in this story, is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al Anwar 80/273.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For sure! Another extreme case for Taqiyya?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>39)</strong> And they narrated from al-Baqir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Do not greet one who is praying with &#8220;Salam&#8221; because he cannot return your greeting”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: It is apparent that forbidding the Tasleem is caused by Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 84/300.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>40)</strong> And they narrated from al-Kadhim, that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Was asked about a man who is praying and another man greets him with Salam, could he return it? Imam said: Yes, he says as &#8220;Peace be on you&#8221; and he points to him with his finger”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and Al Majlisi said: As for pointing it could be considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 84/299, “Wasael al Shia” 7/269.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>41)</strong> And from `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The caller to prayer (mu&#8217;adhin) faces Qiblah during Adhan and Iqamah, when he says: “Hay `Ala al Salat Hay `Ala al Falah”, he turns right then left”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: It could be that turning is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 84/158.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>42)</strong> From al-Baqir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">” The prophet (saw) said: Don’t take my grave as a Qiblah and a mosque, because Allah had cursed those who took the graves of their prophets as places of worship and prostration”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi says: It’s not far (from possibility) that such a narration should be considered as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 83/314.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simply because they insist on worshiping the graves, they consider this one as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>43)</strong> From as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Take your shoes off, because it was from the skin of a dead donkey.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and al Majlisi said: it’s apparent that this is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 83/237, “Wasael al Shia” 4/344.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By Allah! These so called Shia have no shame! His title was as-Sadiq (The Truthful)! Why do you invent narrations to make him look like a compulsive liar?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>44)</strong> And they narrated from prophet (saw):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If it weren&#8217;t too hard on my nation, I would have delayed `Isha prayer until the end of the night”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Could be considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al anwar” 83/64.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure the readers know the narration which was narrated with authentic chains in the books of Ahlul-Sunnah, the Prophet (saw) says: &#8220;He who attributes a lie to me, let him take his rightful place in hell.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>45)</strong> From as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I Disassociate myself from one who delays Maghrib until the stars appear in the sky without a good excuse”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi Said: We can also consider this Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar Al Anwar” 83/60.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>46)</strong> From `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The grave of messenger of Allah (saw) was bumped (elevated) from the surface of the ground by small distance and four fingers and water was sprinkled on it”. `Ali said: “And the Sunnah is to spray the grave with water”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Maybe the addition of four fingers is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 82/37.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know why he said it’s Taqiyya? Because the Shia built huge shrines on all the graves of their Imams or scholars or historical personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>47)</strong> And from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During Adhan he said “Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar” and at the end of it “La Ilaha Illa Allah” once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and al Majlisi said: Saying it once can be Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al shia” 5/421, “Bihar al anwar” 84/119.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>48)</strong> And they narrated from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the Iqamah you say everything once except for “Allahu Akbar”, you say it twice”.<br />
In another narration he said: “In the call to prayer you say everything twice but in Iqamah you say everything once”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At-Tusi said: These two agree with the Madhab of the mainstream Muslims, so they are a type of Taqiyya.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>49)</strong> al-Sadiq from his fathers:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet (saw) prayed with Jahr (an audible voice) while reciting. When he finished he asked his companions: “Did I drop (forget) any verse from the Qur&#8217;an?” They were silent. He then asked “Is Ubay ibn Ka`b among you?” They said yes, so he asked him “Did I drop anything from it?” He said “Yes O messenger of Allah, you dropped so and so…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: we can consider this Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 84/242, “Mustadrak al Wasael” Noori al Tabrasi 4/111.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They will definitely consider narrations like these Taqiyya, because according to them the Imams and prophets can never forget anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>50)</strong> From al-Kadhim:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That he said about man who reads two Suras in one Rak`ah: “If it was a Nafilah (Voluntary) prayer then no harm as for obligatory prayer this is not correct”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider the narrations which permit it to be Taqiyya.<br />
Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 85/13.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>51)</strong> From as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was asked about one Sura, can a man pray with it in two Rak`at from the obligatory prayer? He said: Yes”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Tusi said: This narration is considered Taqiyya because it agrees with the Madhab of the mainstream Muslims, and al Amili said the same.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was asked about the people saying “Ameen” in the prayer in congregation after they read Al Fatiha, he said: How great it is with low voice”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At-Tusi said: If this was true it would be considered Taqiyya.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Prophet (saw) used to pray two (extra) Raka’at after every (obligatory) prayer”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider this Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 87/47.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>60)</strong> From as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On every Friday the Lord descends to the sky in the beginning of the night, and He descends on the last third of every night -in some narrations He has two angels in front of him- Then He (swt) says: “Is there anyone who wants to repent so I can forgive him? Is there anyone who wants to make Istighfar so I can make Istighfar on him? Is there anyone who wishes to ask anything?” When Fajr comes the Lord returns to his throne and divides the bounties amongst his slaves”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 87/165.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>61)</strong> From `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If a man leads others in prayer while he is in a state of Junub (impurity from sexual act) then they all need to repeat their prayer”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider this narration Taqiyya.<br />
Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 88/68.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>62)</strong> Majlisi said: “All narrations about the prophet (sallalahu alaihi wa ala alihi wa sallam) making the prostration of forgetfulness, are Taqiyya”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al anwar” 88/219.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because as we said before, they don’t believe that prophets or Imams can forget, so any narration they have in their books about a prophet or an Imam forgetting something, they will reject it as Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>63)</strong> And they narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadiq was asked about a man who forgot to pray Maghrib and remembered in the second Rak`ah of `Isha prayer. He said: He finishes the prayer and then prays Maghrib after it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: We can consider it Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 88/325.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>64)</strong> From as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Ali bin abi Talib (ra) led the people in prayer when he was not on purified (he was Junub or without Wudu’) and it was Zuhr. Then he entered (his house) and a caller went out and  said: “Ameer al Mumineen prayed while not being in a state of purity so repeat the prayer and tell the people who are absent.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili said: This hadith is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” 8/373.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>65)</strong> Muhammad al-Baqir from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“`Ali (ra) used to dislike returning the greeting while the Imam is giving his sermon”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: The dislike is out of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 98/176.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>66)</strong> And they narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That al-Sadiq said that about 27-th night of Ramadan: In it is Laylat-ul-Qadr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al Majlisi said: Considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 97/296.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What kind of extreme danger could force the Imam to lie in this situation? If it’s known and accepted as a fact that even the companions differed in this case?!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>67)</strong> And they narrated from Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Prophet (saw) has forbidden on the day of Khaybar the meat of the donkey and the Nikah of Mut`ah”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At-Tusi said: This narration is Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Al Tahtheeb” 7/251, “Al Istibsar” 3/142, “Wasael al Shia” 21/12.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the Shia is authentic yet they reject it because they believe in the validity of Mut`ah!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>68)</strong> from Ma`mar bin Khallad that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I asked abu al-Hasan al-Rida (as) about if a man marries a woman in Mut`ah, then he accompanies her from one town to another?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;The other type of marriage is allowed, not this one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: al-Kafi vol.5 pg.467 #7.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researcher of the book says: What is apparent from it, is that the questioner asked about the ruling of Mut`ah, so he (as) answered that Mut`ah is not permissible out of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another authentic narration, they claim it is Taqiyya because they believe that Mut`ah is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>69)</strong> From al-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was asked: What say you about visiting the grave of Hussayn? We heard that some of you (Alhulbayt) said that it is equal to one trip of Hajj or `Umrah? He said: These sayings are weak, it doesn’t reach this level but you should visit him and not abandon him because he is the master of the youth of paradise”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Amili and Al Majlisi said: It’s apparently Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” 14/451, “Bihar al Anwar” 101/35.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>70)</strong> And again from as-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was asked “If I visit the grave of Hussayn do I make it my Qiblah if I pray?” He said: “Move a bit to the side”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al Majlisi said: Maybe he ordered him to move to the side out of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Bihar al Anwar” 101/82.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We perfectly understand why he said it’s Taqiyya. Because they worship the graves of their Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>71)</strong> And from al-Baqir:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Ali did not attributed anyone from the people who fought him to shirk or to hypocrisy, but instead of that he used to say: “Our brothers, that transgressed against us”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al Amili said: This is considered Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: “Wasael al Shia” 15/82.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many more examples, their books are loaded with such cases both the early ones and the late ones.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE:</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After stating these brief samples from the Shia books now we turn our attention to another aspect of this study. Most of these lies are attributed to the Imams of Ahlulbayt and mainly the later ones like al-Baqir and al-Sadiq and their children. These Imams of Ahlulbayt lived during the golden age of Islam, from the Umayyad Caliphate starting with Marwan al Umawi until the days of the Abbaside Caliphate of al-Caliph al Ma’moun…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Huge events happened during these years, many wars and invasions and discoveries and disasters which need huge volumes to cover… We’ll try to very briefly mention some of the events which took place during the lives of these Imams, just to give the readers an idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-`Amro bin Sa`eed bin al `Aas took Damascus during the absence of `Abdul Malik bin Marwan and wanted the Caliphate for himself. So battles took place and a siege until ibn al `Aas asked for peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; The wars between al Azariqah and al Muhallab which lasted many months. In the year 70 the Roum (Christian empire) was angered and they attacked the Muslims then peace happened between them, on the condition that `Abdul Malik would give their King a thousand Dinars every week. But this was a temporary weakness because of the division in the nation and the presence of two Muslim Caliphs at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; `Abdul Malik prepared Armies to go to Iraq and Mus`ab ibn al-Zubayr went to al-Sham and both armies met and some of Mus`ab’s army betrayed him and defected to `Abdul Malik’s side. Finally Mus`ab was killed with his two children `Isa and `Urwah and the warrior Ibrahim bin al Ashtar and Muslim bin `Amro al Bahili. Then `Abdul Malik took `Iraq and areas around it and placed his brother Bishr as the Ameer, Then Al Hajjaj bin Yusuf was preparing to go to Mecca and fight against caliph `Abdullah Ibn Al Zubayr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Al Hajjaj waged war on Ibn al Zubayr and placed catapults on the hills near Mecca and besieged it.  After a long month of battles, `Abdullah bin al Zubayr bin al `Awwam was killed and `Abdul Malik took Mecca.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Al Hajjaj then made war with Shabeeb who had killed `Uthman al-Harithi so he sent `Utab bin Waraq al Rabahi after him to fight him around Kufah. He was also killed and his army defeated. Then He prepared al-Harith bin Mu`awiyah al Thaqafi for the fight and their armies met with that of Shabeeb and He was victorious yet again and he managed to kill Abu al Warid al Nadari after that as well.<br />
-Al Hajjaj marched with his army to fight with Shabeeb and they met and the battle was fierce. Then Shabeeb went to al Ahwaz and in it was Muhammad bin Musa al Taymi who met him in a battle which he lost his life in. Shabeeb marched to Karaman and reinforced his troops then went back to al Ahwaz to meet the armies of al Hajjaj led by al Abrad and they fought until nightfall and Shabeeb had to leave by crossing the river but the bridge was destroyed and he died with the rest of the Khawarij who left with him. Then `Abdul Malik himself made a Ghazwah against the Christian empire and took the city of Heracles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-A Plague had hit the people of Sham and it was so strong that they almost all perished. In the next year al Hajjaj sent to Sijistan `Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad al Ash`ath al Kindi who later rebelled and gathered from Al Basrah many Muslims and scholars to fight against Hajjaj and they were able to defeat him at first, and after around eighty four battles the Umayyad armies led by al Hajjaj emerged victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; Ibn al Ash`ath almost managed to conquer `Iraq and he gathered 33,000 mounted warriors and 120,000 soldiers and they rebelled but the army of `Abdul Malik was victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the battle of Deir al Jamajem and the slogan was “Revenge for Salat” because al Hajjaj used to delay it from its correct time so the people rebelled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the Ghazwah of Muhammad bin Marwan bin al Hakam to Armeniah and their armies clashed with the Christian Roum and in one of the battles the Muslims were hit hard and over a thousand martyred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the great clash near Bukhara between Qutaybah and the Kouffar. Then Sirdaniyah was opened from the Maghrib.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The Turk and the people of Faraghanah and the Sughd marched and with them was the son of the Chinese king’s sister and they were a huge army that was unheard of -they say 200,000- So Qutaibah bin Muslim met them and destroyed them. Then the Roum attacked so Maslamah met them in battle and broke them while opening Harathoumah and Tuwanah. Musa bin Naseer prepared his son `Abdullah and took the islands of muwayriqah and munawraqah. His other son Marwan also waged wars and took lands. Maslamah then made a Ghazwah against the Roum and defeated them and took Amouriyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Maslamah attacked Syria and took the five fortresses. The King of Talqan backstabbed Qutaibah with the help of the Turk of Tarkhan but Qutaibah was victorious and then he killed many from the people of Talqan.<br />
-A Huge battle took place between the Muslims and Samarqand and after they opened it they built the mosque. Later the Muslim armies scored huge victories in the east and the west in al Andalus and India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Muslims made a Ghazwah of Constantinople. Yazeed bin al Muhallab also took Jarjan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the king of the Turk Khaqan fought many long battles against the Muslims and his son died ibn Khaqan died after he was able to kill the Ameer of the Muslims Al Harith bin `Amro in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the Khazar took Ardabeel by the sword so Hisham sent Sa`eed bin `Amro al Jurashee to Azerbaijan to battle them and he won and took much war booty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the Turk rebellion in Khurasan and Al Harith bin Abi Shuraih al Khariji joined them so they crossed the river of Jihoun. Then Asad bin Abdullah al Qasree marched against them and he defeated them. Marwan al Himar then opened three fortresses and took the King Touman Shah as a prisoner and sent him to al Sham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; In al Maghrib lots of wars took place and a huge sect came and gave allegiance to `Abdul Wahid al Huwari and the Berber all supported him. So they fought the Muslims and lost the battle and many of them were killed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; In the Maghrib Kulthoum bin Ayyad al Qusheeri was killed and his army was ripped apart, they were defeated by Abu Yusuf al Azari the head of the Sufriyah. Kulthoum had given the Wilayah of Damascus to Hashim then gave him the mission of fighting the Khawarij in the Maghrib. Then the cousin of Kulthoum who was called Balj al Qusheeri stood firm and he was able to defeat the Khawarij and their leader Maysarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Abu Muslim al Khurasani took the slaves of Khurasan and defeated the armies and this was the beginning of the state of bani al `Abbas and the defeat of bani Umayyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; In 132 hijri al Saffah was given allegiance by the people of Kufah and he prepared his uncle `Abdullah bin `Ali to fight against Marwan who in turn marched against him with a 100,000, but he lost and Abdullah took the Arab peninsula and asked for al Sham, Marwan ran to Egypt but was abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-`Abdullah went to Damascus and laid siege, in it was the cousin of Marwan called al Waleed bin Mu`awiyah bin Marwan. They took it by the sword and several thousand of the Umayyads were killed amongst them was its Ameer Al Waleed and Suleiman bin Hashim bin `Abdul Malik.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The Battle of al Musnah took place so from those who died was the Ameer Quhtubah bin Shabeeb al Ta’ee al Marouzi one of Bani al `Abbas then his son took control of that army straight away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Abu Muslim al Khurasani managed to kill the Ameer Suleiman bin Katheer al Khuza`ee al Marouzi of Bani Al `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-In the year 136 hijri, the Caliph al Saffah died and his state was only 5 years old and there was chaos and many lands in the west of Sudan and the area of al Andalus were lost to the Khawarij and other tribes and groups, then came his brother the caliph Abu Ja`far al Mansour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-In the beginning of 137 hijri `Abdullah bin `Ali heard of the death of al Saffah his brother, so he asked for al Sham for himself and he made camp in Dabiq and claimed that al Saffah gave him the succession. Al Mansour prepared Abu Muslim al Khurasani to battle him and the armies met in the month of Jamadah al Akhir. The armies of `Abdulah were pushed back and he ran away to al Basarah to his brother. Then Abu Muslim found many treasures of bani Umayyah So he rebelled against al Mansour and opted to remove him from caliphate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; In the year 138 hijri the tyrant of the Roum appeared and he was Constantine bin Alion bin Constantine and he had 100,000 soldiers, and made camp in Dabiq. Salih bin `Ali the uncle of al Mansour met him there and the armies clashed until the Muslims were victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; After Constantine burned the new Muslim farms a group called Al Rawandiyyah appeared in Khurasan and they used to believe in the cloning of souls and that their God is al Mansour and that al Haytham bin Mu`awiyah was Gabriel and they went to the castle of al Mansour so he arrested them and others got angry so they marched against him with 600 fighters. `Uthman bin Nuhaik who was the Ameer was wounded in al Hashimiyah so al Mansour replaced him with his brother `Isa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The Muslims finally opened the lands of Tabarstan after long wars. Then in the Maghrib the Ameer Muhammad ibn al Ash`ath led an army to fight and destroy the Ibadiyah and he killed their leader Abu al Khattab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; In 145 hirji Muhammad bin `Abdullah bin al Hassan appeared with 250 men in Madinah in the beginning of Rajab. So he imprisoned the Mutawwali of Madinah called Rabah. Then he made a Sermon and the people of Madinah gave him allegiance. He then claimed that he appeared out of anger for Allah and he appointed a governor for Mecca and Yemen and Sham. Then Al Mansour chose his cousin Isa bin Musa to fight him and he did this because he wanted Isa to die as al Saffah had appointed him as his successor while al Mansour wanted his son al Mahdi to rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-`Isa marched with 4,000 and he wrote to the Ashraf to get them to side with him so many people abandoned Muhammad bin `Abdullah who in turn refused to seek aid from Egypt but decided to stay fortified in Madinah until Isa decided to march in on him. `Uthman bin Muhammad bin Khalid said: “And Muhammad had killed almost seventy men and with him was only three hundred fighters but finally his head was detached from his body and sent to al Mansour.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Ibrahim bin `Abdullah bin al Hassan had rebelled in al Basarah after he entered it in secret with ten people, so he called for himself in secret and 4,000 gave him allegiance. He then sent a `Amil to al Ahwaz and one to Persia and one to al Wasit so he can open them. Al Mansour then sent an army of 5,000 led by Amir al Miski to fight him and they clashed several times, many died in Basarah and Wasit. Finally Ibrahim was killed by an arrow in his throat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so on…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was just a brief sample of some of the events which were happening during those days in which the Imams were alive. So can you imagine dear reader that the Caliphs and generals of Bani Umayyah and Bani al `Abbas left all the affairs of the state and all those wars and the economy and the plagues and the defense of the lands and the planning of the conquests and fighting the isolationists and exploring the oceans ect? Can you imagine that they left all of this and that instead they dispersed their armies in the mosques and the lands and paid them their wages in order for them to see which one of the Imams of Ahlulbayt would speak about “If Eve was created from the liver of Adam or not?” Or  “if Adam had appeared in India”? Or at what age did Ismail (as) die? Or how many years did prophet Jonah (as) spend in the belly of the whale? Or to see the ruling of one who eats lots of Jarjeer? Or opening the eyes during Wudu? Or wiping the face with a towel after it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No sane human being would accept these ridiculous Shia stories. So from what you just read you can come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no need for this Taqiyya in the first place nor is there a reason which explains why Taqiyya has such a high rank in shiism that they considered it one of their specialties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As said shia shaikh Muhammad Rza Muzaffar in “`Aqa’id-ul-Imamiya” (chapter 33. Doctrine of Dissimulation (Taqiyya):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And this (Taqiyya) is still a sign by which the Shi`ah are known, and which distinguishes them from other sects and other people.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WERE THE SHIA THE ONLY ONES WHO WERE OPPRESSED BY RULERS?<br />
</strong><br />
Then shia scholars claim that the shia were the only ones being oppressed and that Ahlul Sunnah were not oppressed at all because they agreed to the Aqeedah of the rulers. And this is nothing but blatant lie!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Abu Hanifah al Nu`man was tortured until it was said that he was killed in the prison of al Mansour because he supported the revolutions of several from Ahlul-Bayt like Muhammad and his brother Ibrahim the children of al Hassan (r.a). And he supported the revolution of Zayd bin `Ali Zainul `Abideen against the Umayyads. He had said when Zayd revolted: “His Khourouj is equal to the Khourouj of the Prophet (saw) on the day of Badr”. He offered Imam Zayd 30,000 Dirhams to fund his revolution.<br />
Then in 145 hijri, He supported the revolution of Muhammad known as al Nafs al Zakkiyah who was from Ahlul-Bayt . Abu Hanifa made a Fatwa on the permissibility of joining his army and he gave him 4,000 dirhams then told him that he had nothing else left to give.<br />
Abu Hanifa was finally asked by the rulers to be the head of judges, as they wanted to win him over to their side, but when he refused this, they imprisoned him and tortured him to death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Imam Malik ibn Anas also was hit with whips until his shoulder was dislocated as he was of the same opinion as Abu Hanifa. When he was asked “Is it permissible to fight those who make Khourouj against the Caliph?” He said: “It’s permissible if they make Khourouj on the likes of `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz”, it’s a smart way of telling them that it is allowed to make Khourouj on all other Caliphs. Then they asked him: “What if the ruler was not like Ibn `Abdul `Aziz?” He replied: “Then let them fight each other, and let Allah take his revenge from the oppressors with the oppressors”. So he forbade anyone from defending the Caliphs and so he was tortured.<br />
I add, He encouraged going against the Caliph Abu Ja`far publicly during Al Nafs al Zakiyyah’s revolution. The Muslims of Madinah came to him and told him that they can’t join because they have pledged allegiance to the `Abbasi Caliph so he told them: “You made this Allegiance while you were forced to do so, and the one who is forced does not need to keep his promise (of allegiance)”. So the people hurriedly joined the army of Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Then the famous hardships which Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal had to face in the days of Al Ma’moun and Al Mutawakkil in the issues of  “the creation of the Quran” . Many others died as a result like Muhammad bin Nooh who accompanied Ibn Hanbal and the Faqih and Muhaddith Na`eem bin Hammad and Yusuf bin Yahya al Bouti al Masri the companion of Imam al Shafi`i and his successor. These scholars died in prison. Then you have the grand scholar Ahmad bin Nasr al Khuza`ee who was killed by the Caliph al Wathiq himself with a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And many more such as Ibn Taymiyyah who spent most of his life in Jail, or al-Imam al-Bukhari who was exiled and others…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narrating the stories and hardships and the oppression of the scholars of Ahlul Sunnah is a giant task which needs separate books. It’s totally unacceptable and unfair that the Shia scholars trick the laymen and followers by telling them ‘this or that’ narration is a Taqiyya by the Imam because they were the only victims, and that the caliphs had nothing better to do than to spy on them and hear their news and spread webs of spies to track down their hidden Mahdi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end I find it appropriate to quote the scholars of Ahlul-Sunnah on this matter of Taqiyya and view their stance and then the reader can compare it to that of the Twelver Shia:<br />
Ibn Jawzi said in “Zaadul Mayser” (1/361):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[“Taqiyya is something permitted but not obligatory. When Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was asked: “If there would be a sword upon your head, you would again tell the truth?” The Imam answered: “When the scholar speaks with Taqiyya, and the layman speaks out of ignorance, who then in this case would reveal the truth?”]</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CAN THE LEGITIMACY OF AN IMAM BE PROVEN IN CASE OF CONSTANT TAQIYYA?</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the main Shia book al-Kafi, volume 1, page 284, we find a chapter called:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Affairs that necessitate the proof of the Imam (as)”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By “proof” they mean how you prove that a certain person is a true Imam, because as you know anyone can claim to be an Imam and anyone can claim that anyone else is an Imam, and you can review our article called “Tree of men believed to be Imams by the Shia sects” in the respective section.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how do you truly prove the validity or legitimacy of an Imam?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter I quote two authentic Shia narrations:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[…`Abdul-A`la said: I told abu `Abdillah (as): “The one who rushes to claim Imamah for himself, how do we verify him?” He (as) replied: “He is asked about the lawful and the unlawful.” Then he turned to me and said: “There are three proofs that are not gathered in anyone unless he were the patron of this affair: he must be the closest of the people to the Imam before him; he must have possession of the weapon (of the prophet (saw)); and his Wasiyyah must be public and apparent – [so much so, that even] if one had entered Madinah and had asked the commoners and even the little boys, “Whom did fulan depute?”, they would say, “fulan the son of fulan”.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second authentic Shia narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[…Ahmad bin `Umar from abi al-Hasan al-Rida (as) I asked him about the indicating signs of the patron of this affair. So he said: The indicating signs to him are: elderliness (i.e. the oldest living son), merit, and the testament – if men who traveled on horseback and came to Madinah and asked, “Whom did fulan depute?” it would be said “fulan the son of fulan”, and they follow wherever the armaments reside.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on these narrations and other similar ones, the legitimacy of the Imamah of any person is proven if he gathered certain conditions, from them is that the people of Madinah, all of them, men women and children, must know that such and such is the Imam, and he deputed his son so and so after him and gave him the Wasiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Question: We know that the main thing that pushes the Shia Imams to practice Taqiyya is because they are afraid of the tyrant rulers, so they hide their Imamah and Wasiyyah out of fear. How then in this case, can the legitimacy of ANY of the Shia Imams be proven if they hide it from the people?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact it is prove from many Shia texts and by confession of their scholars that the Imams would hide the matter of Imamah from their closest followers and this is why even their best companions would be confused as to who is the next Imam after the death of his father.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If this is the case, then how can the little boys of Madinah have knowledge of this matter, so that when the riders come and ask them they say: “So and so is the Imam and he appointed his son so and so as his depute and successor”!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I add, if the Imams do not hide the matter of Imamah and Wasiyyah, then why do they hide smaller insignificant matters? The books of the Shia are full of contradicting Fiqhi narrations, and other narrations which differ with the beliefs of the Twelvers, their scholars explain all of this as “Taqiyya”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Shia were to say that the Imams practice Taqiyya in small Fiqhi matters so they can mingle with the commoners and laypeople of Ahlul-Sunnah, we reply by saying that Ahlul-Sunnah and their scholars had many differences of opinions in many matters of Fiqh. The biggest of the Sunni Imams differed, we take an extreme example, the marriage of Mut`ah: This was the opinion of `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (ra) and Imam ibn Jurayj (rah), yet no one harmed or killed them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is known and popular is that the Imams of the Shia are loved by the Sunni laymen and their problem is not that of Fiqh, because they were not killed one after the other because of silly Fiqhi issues such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Sadiq was asked about the ruling of the urine of the wild cat, the dog, the donkey and the horse. He replied: “They are like the urine of humans.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi said in al-Istibsar 1/180: “It’s also possible that these are a type of Taqiyya.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Baqir said: “There is no harm in the blood of the flea and the urine of the bat.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi said in al-Istibsar 1/188: “We consider this narration as a kind of Taqiyya as it conflicts with the foundations of (the Shia) Madhab.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we’ve seen sufficient examples of such cases previously in our article should you recall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our point is that the Imams surely do not give precedence to silly matters such as “praying while wearing the skin of the fox” or “washing the clothes after touching the urine of bats” over a giant and dangerous matter such as Imamah, which means “Leadership” in Arabic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather the Shia Imams were killed mainly because of Imamah as the Shia claim, and they were killed by the oppressive rulers and regimes. This happened because they feared that these divinely appointed Imams would challenge them and overthrow them, not because of differences of opinion in jurisprudence, taking into consideration that the Shia accuse these rulers of being irreligious, and that they would drink wine openly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, when the Shia leader al-Murtada was asked about the occultation of the Mahdi, in his book “al-Muqni` fil-Ghaybah” he said that the Mahdi hid himself out of fear from the rulers, so a man asked him:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If fear pushed him into hiding, then his fathers (previous Imams) were in a state of constant Taqiyya and fear from the enemies, why didn’t they also hide!?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We say: His fathers peace be upon them had no fears from the enemy, because they practiced Taqiyya, and did not act as if they were the Imams, and they denied that they were Imams.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is true, when we observe the confusion of their followers and companions at the time, and when we read their narrations about Imamah, such this narration from Basa’ir al-Darajat by al-Saffar pg.48:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Verily, our &#8216;affair&#8217; is a secret in a secret, and a concealed secret, and a secret that is only known as a secret, and a secret upon a secret and a secret veiled by a secret.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or such as when Musa al-Kadhim (rah) is talking to his companion, in the famous narration of Hisham ibn Salim, that describes the confusion of the Shia after the death of al-Sadiq (rah), he tells him:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[‘Ask, you will have the answers but do not make them public. If you did so it would be slaughtering.’ I asked him and found him to be like an ocean of knowledge that does not diminish. I then said, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, your Shi‘a, followers and the followers of your father are in loss due to false guidance. Thus, can I meet them and call them to you? I will keep it secret.’ He said, ‘If you can find intelligent people inform them but make them to promise secrecy. If they make it public it will be slaughter,’ he pointed with his hand to his throat.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our question still remains, if Imamah and Wasiyyah is shrouded by so much secrecy, then how can the little boys and commoners of Madinah know about it? And how then would we be able to prove the legitimacy of their Imamah by their own standards?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EXAMPLES OF CONFLICTING SHIA NARRATIONS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extreme Shia are historically unreliable people and they are popular for fabricating narrations and believing in their own fabrications, they attributed many narrations to their Imams without any thought or planning that they ended up causing themselves a huge issue, the issue of conflicting narrations. Most lies were attributed to two of their Imams, al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, which is why Ibn Tayymiyah said in “Minhaj al-Sunnah” when talking about Ja`far al-Sadiq:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He is amongst the best in Knowledge and piety (…) They have attributed more lies to him than they’ve done to those before him.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below we quickly list some examples of conflicting Shia narrations, please keep in mind that the Shia believe that their Imams are infallible, which means they cannot contradict each-other or change their own religious verdicts, yet below we will see them do just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1)</strong> Is the remembrance the Prophet (saw) or the Qur’an?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Kafi 1/211: […from abu Baseer from Imam abu `Abdullah (as) regarding the saying of Allah: {And indeed, it is a remembrance for you and your people, and you are going to be questioned.} [43:44] he (as) said: &#8220;The Prophet (SAWS) is the &#8220;remembrance&#8221; and his Ahlul-Bayt (as) are those who will be questioned and they are the people of remembrance.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Kafi 1/211: […from al-Fudayl from abu `Abdullah (as) about the saying of Allah: {And indeed, it is a remembrance for you and your people, and you are going to be questioned.} [43:44] he (as) said: &#8220;The Qur’an is the &#8220;remembrance&#8221; and we are his people and we shall be asked.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2)</strong> Walking to Hajj or riding to Hajj?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 4/455: […from ibn Bukayr: I said to abu `Abdullah (as): &#8220;We want to walk to Makkah.&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t walk, ride (camels) instead.&#8221; I said: &#8220;May Allah fix your affair, it has reached us that al-Hasan bin `Ali (as) used Walk to Hajj.&#8221; he (as) said: &#8220;al-Hasan bin `Ali used to make Hajj walking but his travel equipment was carried for him (on the backs of animals).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 4/456: […from Rifa`ah: I asked abu `Abdullah (as) did al-Hasan walk (to hajj) from Makkah or from Madinah? he (as) said from Makkah, I asked him that if I visit the house(Ka`bah) do I ride or walk? he (as) said: &#8220;al-Hasan (as) used to visit (the house of Allah) while riding.&#8221; I asked him about riding and walking, which is better? he (as) said: &#8220;riding.&#8221; I said: riding is better than walking? he (as) said: &#8220;Yes because Rassul-Allah (SAWS) used to ride.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 4/456: […from Rifa`ah and ibn Bukayr from abu `Abdullah (as) that he was asked regarding which is better, walking or riding to Hajj? he (as) said: &#8220;Riding is better, because Rassul-Allah (SAWS) used to make Hajj while riding.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wasa’il al-Shia 11/78 under the chapter title: [“It is recommended to walk to Hajj rather than riding, and walking bare footed is better than wearing shoes unless there is exception.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read in this chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[…from `Abdullah bin Sinan from abu `Abdullah (as) he said: &#8220;Allah was not worshiped by something better than walking (to Hajj).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[…from al-Halabee: I asked abu `Abdullah (as) about the virtue of walking (to Hajj)? He (as) said: &#8230;&#8230; (al-Husayn bin `Ali) made twenty pilgrimages while walking on his feet.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3)</strong> Sending Islamic greeting “al-Salam” to women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Kafi 5/535: […from Ghiyath bin Ibrahim from abu `Abdullah (as): &#8220;Do not make Salam on the woman.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Kafi 5/535: […from Rib`i bin `Abdullah from abu `Abdullah (as): The Prophet (SAWS) used to make Salam on the women and they used to return it, and Ameer al-Mumineen `Ali (as) used to make Salam on the women but disliked to make it on the young teenage women, he used to say: &#8220;I fear that I may like her voice, so I would end up with more than just the reward (of making Tasleem).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4)</strong> Does al-Madhi (prostatic fluid, a substance that comes out of a man&#8217;s organ during foreplay before ejaculation.) Does it invalidate the ablution?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mukhtalaf al-Shia 1/262: [In the SAHIH from Zayd al-Shahham that he said: I said to abu `Abdullah (as): Does al-Madhi invalidate ablution? he (as) said: &#8220;No, and the clothes are not to be washed nor the body, for it is similar to spit and mucus.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tahdheeb al-Ahkam 1/18: [Muhammad bin Isma`eel in the SAHIH said: I asked al-Rida (as) regarding al-Madhi so he ordered me to make ablution from it, then I repeated the question in the next year and he again told me to make Wudhu, he (as) said: `Ali bin abi Talib (as) asked al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad to ask the Prophet (SAWS) when he felt shy from asking him, so he (SAWS) replied: &#8220;He must make ablution (from it).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5)</strong> Saying “Ameen” after reciting al-Fatiha (opening chapter) in Salat?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tahdheeb al-Ahkaam 2/74: […from Muhammad al-Halabee, I asked abu `Abdillah (as): “Do I say “Ameen” when I finish the Fatiha?” he (as) replied: “No.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Istibsar 1/318: [From ibn abi `Umayr from Jameel bin Darraj al-Nakh`ee: I asked abu `Abdullah (as) about the saying of the people during Salat after the Fatiha of the Book: Ameen? He (as) said: &#8220;How good it is in a low voice.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6)</strong> Is wine pure or impure?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khoei states this in al-Tanqeeh fi Sharh al-`Urwah al-Wusta, volume 3, book of Taharah, pg.83:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The difference (of opinion) in this matter is from a group from the early scholars like al-Saduq and his Father in al-Resalah, and al-Ju`fi and al-`Ammani and a group of the late scholars such as al-Ardabilee and others who have went to the opinion that it(Wine) is pure, their difference in this comes from the difference in the narrations and this is because there was no consensus on the impurity of wine after a group from the biggest scholars like al-Saduq and al-Ardabilee and others decided that it was pure, also the holy book does not contain a proof of its impurity]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Hada&#8217;eq al-Nadirah by al-Bahrani:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is narrated by Thiqat-ul-Islam in the SAHIH from `Ali bin Mehzayar that he said: I read in the book of `Abdullah bin Muhammad to abu al-Hassan (as): May I be a sacrifice for you, Zurarah narrated from abu Ja`far (as) and abu `Abdillah (as) regarding the wine when it stains a person&#8217;s clothes that there is no harm in praying in it because Allah prohibited drinking it only. and other than Zurarah narrated from abu `Abdullah (as) that if it stains your clothes then wash the stain unless you do not know where the stain is then wash all of your clothes, and if you pray while it is on your clothes then repeat your prayer. so which of the two sayings should I take? he (as) sent me: take the saying of abu `Abdullah (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some examples of what al-`Amili narrated in Wasa&#8217;el al-Shia in chapter 38 from the chapters of Najasat:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What al-Hassan bin abi Sarah narrated in the SAHIH: I said to abu `Abdullah (as): If my clothes were stained with some wine, do I pray in them before washing them? he (as) said: No harm, the clothes do not get intoxicated.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What was narrated from `Abdullah bin Bukayr in the Muwaththaq: a man asked abu `Abdullah (as) about the intoxicant and the wine if they stain the clothes while we were there, he (as) said: No harm in it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What was narrated by the great dignified reliable scholar `Abdullah bin Ja`far al-Humeiri in Qurb al-Isnad in the SAHIH from `Ali bin Ri&#8217;ab: I asked abu `Abdullah (as) about the intoxicating wine if it stains my clothes, do I wash it or pray in it? he (as) said: Pray in them&#8230;Allah (swt) only prohibited drinking it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn Babawieh narrated in the Mursal that: abu Ja`far (as) and abu `Abdullah (as) were asked: we buy clothes and they are stained by wine and the oil of the pigs, do we pray in them? he (as) said: Yes, no harm, Allah has only prohibited drinking and eating, he did not prohibit wearing and touching and praying in it.<br />
al-Saduq narrated it in `Ilal al-Shara&#8217;e` with a SAHIH chain from Bukayr from al-Baqir (as), also from abu al-Sabbah and abu Sa`eed and al-Hassan al-Nabbal from al-Sadiq (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[al-Sheikh narrated in the SAHIH from `Ali bin Ja`far from his brother Musa (as): that he was asked about a man who passes by rain water mixed with wine and it stains his clothes, does he pray in them before washing? He (as) said: &#8220;He does not wash his clothes or his feet and he prays in them and no harm.&#8221; He narrated it in Qurb al-Isnad.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And finally al-Bahrani says on page 105:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When you know all this, then you should (also) know that a group from the virtuous of the late scholars like al-Sayyed al-Sanad in al-Madarik and al-Fadil al-Khurasani in al-Thakheerah and al-Khawansari and others have chosen the opinion that it is pure, and declared that there was no consensus on this matter]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, these narrations are SAHIH and MUWATHTHAQ and reliable, but there&#8217;s a LOT of other SAHIH and MUWATHTHAQ narrations stating that it is impure and Najis, just like the first Sahih Hadith I quoted in which the Imam tell his companion to take the saying of abu `Abdullah (as), here&#8217;s what al-Khoei says in the same source stated above:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[There are plenty of narrations which makes it certain that some of them have come from the Imams (as) and there is no need to even discuss their chains, also they are clear and explicit in declaring that wine is IMPURE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand there are lots of other narrations &#8211; including Sahih and Muwaththaq narrations &#8211; that explicitly prove the PURITY of wine, and when it comes to the amount of narrations they are more than those which declare it to be impure, and the claim that these narrations must have certainly come from the Imams (as) is not far from truth.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what do the Shia usually do in this case? They apply their corrupt methodology to see what what agrees with the Quran or what opposes Ahlul-Sunnah, al-Khoei says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And these are two opposing groups of narrations, so we must fix this matter by looking at what agree with al-Qur&#8217;an and disagrees with al-`Ammah(Sunnies)&#8230;&#8230;And both of these factors are lost, as for the agreement with the Quran, we have previously stated that the book of Allah does not mention anything about the purity or impurity of wine, and as for disagreeing with al-`Ammah(Sunnies) this is not valid because each group of narrations agrees with them in a way and disagrees with them in another way.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words they&#8217;re stuck as usual, since the Qur&#8217;an most of the time contains nothing about detailed matters of Fiqh, and since Ahlul-Sunnah have a valid difference of opinion on this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE CONFLICTING NARRATIONS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The books of the Shia are full of  Taqiyya and conflicting reports from their &#8220;infallible&#8221; Imams to the extent that no matter is free from differences of opinion. The leader of the Twelver Imami Shia sect al-Tusi says in “al-`Iddah fi Usoul al-Fiqh” 1/138:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> [I (al-Tusi) have mentioned their narrations (as) in different Ahadith regarding Fiqh in my book &#8220;al-Istibsar&#8221; and &#8220;Tahdheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; and they number around five thousand(narrations). I have mentioned that the (Twelver) sect differed in following most of them. That is too popular and cannot be hidden. In fact, if you observe their difference in the rulings you would find that they differ more than the difference between Abu Hanifa, Malik and al-Shafi`i.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We direct the readers to our article “The Sunnah are divided and the Shia are united?” for more on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their renowned scholar Ja`far al-Subhani says in &#8220;al-Rasa’il al-Arba`ah&#8221; pg.201:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When we read the two books (of Hadith): Wasael al-Shia and Mustadrak al-Wasael for example, we see that there is no chapter or Fiqhi section which is free from conflicting narrations, this has caused some of those who converted to the Imami Madhab to leave it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This matter has become so serious that some of their biggest scholars left the Madhab, such as the teacher of their leader al-Tusi, in &#8220;Rasa’il fi Dirayat al-Hadith&#8221; by abu al-Fadl al-Babili vol.2 pg.223 &amp; in &#8220;Tahdheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; vol.1 pg.2 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then he(al-Tusi) mentions about his teacher abu al-Hassan al-Harouni al-`Alawi, that he used to believe in the truth(Shia Madhab), and that he took Imamah as his religion, but he left it when he became confused because of the conflicting narrations, and he abandoned the Madhab.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their famous scholar and researcher Yusuf al-Bahrani said in &#8220;al-Hada’iq al-Nadirah&#8221; vol.1 pg.5:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Only a small amount of the rulings of the religion were known for sure, because their narrations were mixed with the narrations of Taqiyya, as was admitted by Thiqat al-Islam Muhammad bin Ya`qoub al-Kulayni may Allah fill his grave with light in his collection al-Kafi]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the big amount of conflicting narrations and the fact that they can’t tell the difference between them has damaged their entire religion greatly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THE BEST SOLUTION IS TAQIYYA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia of our days will try to weaken the chains of narrators when faced with examples such as those listed above. However, this does not always work as sometimes both contradicting narrations are authentic and the early Shia were not known for weakening narrations or commenting on chains of transmission, for them the easiest solution was to simply choose one of the two and say “This is Taqiyya!”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when the Shia scholars find any narration that does not suit their tastes, they choose the quickest excuse, and settle the issue without headaches and effort!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read the following narration in “Rawdat al-Muttaqeen fi Sharh man la Yahduruhu al-Faqeeh” vol.3 pg.44:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[In the Sahih, from Zurarah that he said: I was sitting with abu Ja`far (as) at his place, and there was no one present except his son Ja`far (as), so he said: &#8220;O Zurarah, abu Dharr and `Uthman disputed during the days of the Prophet (SAWS), `Uthman said: “All money from gold or silver that the people use in trade, they must pay Zakat for it after one year passes”. abu Dharr replied: “You don’t need to pay Zakat for the money you work with in trade and such, but if it was stored and unused for one year, then one must pay its Zakat”. So they went to the Prophet (SAWS) to solve their dispute and he told them: “The saying of abu Dharr is correct.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">abu `Abdullah Ja`far (as) said to his father al-Baqir (as): &#8220;Why would you bring something like this up!? The Muslims will cease to have kindness and sympathy for the poor and weak among them (If they hear this).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Baqir (as) replied to him: &#8220;Get off my back! I found it obligatory!&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This authentic narration shows a dispute between two infallible Imams over a matter of religion, how will al-`Allamah al-Majlisi solve this one then? He writes in his commentary:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is apparent is that their dispute may peace be upon them was to silence the `Aamah(Sunnies) so that they may say: “He quarreled with him and did not accept from him!” because (we Shia believe) he only reports what he heard from his fathers from the Prophet (SAWS) from Allah (swt).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: The report states that it was only al-Baqir and Zurarah and al-Sadiq in the house, no Sunnies were present so they can “silence” them, unless they&#8217;re taking acting lessons in a theater. Zurarah is a Shia not a Sunni, and Ahlul-Sunnah never narrated this tradition only the Shia have it in their books, the one narrating it from Zurarah is a famous Shia called `Umar bin Udhaynah, so ponder!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example is Tahdheeb al-Ahkaam by al-Tusi, vol.1 pg.93:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Zayd bin `Ali from Imam `Ali (as): I sat down to perform Wudhu(ablution)  and the Prophet (SAWS) had come when I began so he said to me: &#8220;Rinse your mouth, sniff water and use Siwak&#8221; So I washed my face three times so he (SAWS) said: &#8220;Wash it only twice.&#8221; then I washed my arm and wiped my head twice, so he (SAWS) told me: &#8220;Wipe it only once&#8221; and I washed my feet so he (SAWS) told me: &#8220;O `Ali wash between the fingers so that the fire may not reach them.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now this narration openly states that `Ali (ra) washed his feet in ablution, this is contrary to what the Shia of our days do, since they believe one must only wipe his feet and that washing is an innovation by Ahlul-Sunnah. How will the author of the book, the leader of the Shia sect al-Tusi, how will he deal with this issue?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He writes in his commentary:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This narration agrees with the beliefs of al-&#8216;Aamah(Ahlul-Sunnah) so it is Taqiyya.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an issue! Al-Tusi says the Imam was in Taqiyya and he only said this to please the Sunnies, I say: Wrong! The Imam said in this narration that you must wash your face twice, yet Ahlul-Sunnah believe that one must wash his face three times in Wudhu!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TAKE THE NARRATION THAT CONTRADICTS THE BELIEFS OF THE SUNNIES:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this purpose, they started to invent rules and fabricate stories that would help them to pick one narration over the other without having to admit that these narrations are lies or that the Imam made a mistake or differed with another Imam because this would cancel their infallibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From these many rules you will come across: In case of conflict, you have to accept only the narrations of the latter Imams because Taqiyya was less in their time, another rule is to choose the more numerous narrations in terms of quantity over the others, another is to compare the content to the book of Allah and reject what conflicts with it, another rule says to take the consensus and what is popular and practiced upon by the majority of Shia, but out of all of these what sticks out the most is the rule that says: “Take whatever contradicts the Sunnies.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surely from the worst and most sinister of beliefs that they adopted was to look at their conflicting narrations and take whatever opposes the Sunni view, this belief was invented by their leaders to further push their followers away from the mainstream Sunnies and to keep the identity of the Madhab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This following authentic narration is from al-Kulayni’s book al-Kafi, in the book of knowledge, from the chapter of the difference of narrations 1/68:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ja`far bin Muhammad was asked: May I be sacrifice for you, If two scholars(faqihs) extract a ruling from the Qur’an and the Sunnah and we have two proofs, one proof is in agreement with the mainstream Muslims (Ahlul Sunnah) and the other proof contradicts what they believe in, which proof do we take?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam said: take what contradicts the mainstream Muslims because in it you will find guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: May I be sacrifice for you, what if both proofs agree with the beliefs of the mainstream Muslims? The Imam replied: then you need to check which of the two they lean towards the most and leave it and take the other. ]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar ibn Babawayh al-Qummi al-Saduq writes in “`Uyoun Akhbar al-Rida”:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[On the authority of `Ali ibn Asbat, “I told Al-Rida (as), ‘There are times when I must know the decree on an issue which arises, but I am in another town where none of your followers are present from whom to ask.’ The Imam (as) said, ‘Go to that town’s jurisprudent and present your question. Act against whatever he decrees since that is the right thing to do.’”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which means if you are in any Islamic country, which is most likely Sunni, then go to the Mufti, ask him your question, and then whatever he says, you have to do the opposite!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their leader Ayatullah al-Khomayni in his “Risalat al-Ta`addud wal-Tajreeh” talks about a question that Ja`far al-Sadiq got:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We come across two hadiths, he orders us to follow one and leave the other. He said: “Don’t practice with any of the two until you meet your (Shia) friend and ask him”. I (narrator) said: “I have to choose one and work with it”. He said: “Take the one which contradicts the mainstream Muslims (Sunnies) and work with it”.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Ayatullah `Ali al-Milani writes in the second chapter of “al-Tahqeeq fi Nafi al-Tahreef `an al-Qur’an al-Shareef”:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Thiqat al-Islam Muhammad ibn Ya`qoob al Kulayni has mentioned in the introduction of his book that he adopted two main points in order to verify the Sahih of the Hadiths from the weak ones:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly: Whatever agrees with the Quran is Sahih, whatever disagrees with it is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly: Whatever agrees with the mainstream Muslims is weak, whatever opposes them is Sahih.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHIA USE TAQIYYA AMONG THEMSELVES:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khomeini who surpasses some of the Prophets of bani Israel according to some of their scholars said while defining Taqiyya:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Dividing Taqiyya based on the ones it is used with, sometimes it(Taqiyya) is used with the Kuffar and those who do not believe in Islam whether they were Sultans or average people, and other times it is used with the Sultans of the `Aamah(Sunnies) or their Emirs, Thirdly: It can be used with their scholars and judges, Fourthly: It can be used with their average laypeople, and Fifthly: It can be used with the Sultans of the Shia and their laypeople among other uses]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: al-Rasa&#8217;el by al-Khomeini 2/175.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Bihar ul Anwar, Vol. 27, p. 289 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is narrated from Yunus ibn Talha that he said “Once I asked al-Rida, recipient of divine supreme covenant, ‘Is it true that only an Imam has the authority to wash the body of an Imam for burial?’ “The Imam asked, ‘Do you not know who came to wash his body for burial? The ones who were far more excellent than those who were absent during washing his body for burial, came to wash him for burial. They were those who came to Joseph in the well to help when his parents and family were absent from him (i.e Jibril and angels).’”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mulla Baqir Majlisi says regarding it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Perhaps these narrations are based on Taqiyya, either from the Sunnis or from the laymen among the Shias.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Bihar ul Anwar, Vol. 25, p. 358 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ayub ibn Hurr has narrated either from Imam Ja`far or someone who narrated from him, that he (i.e the narrator) said : We say that some Imams are more knowledgeable than others. Imam replied : Yes. But their knowledge about Halal and Haram, and Tafsir of Quran is similar.<br />
Hussain ibn Ziyad has narrated a similar report from Imam Jafar.<br />
Muhammad ibn Esa has narrated as similar report from Hasan ibn Ziyad.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now lets read what Majlisi has to say regarding it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is possible that it is based on Taqiyya from the extremist Shias.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Mirat ul Uqool, Vol. 21, p. 198 we read that the Imam lies about Umm Kulthoum&#8217;s marriage from `Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Umar ibn Adheena asked Imam Ja`far Sadiq &#8216;People claim that &#8216;Ali married his daughter to such a person&#8217;. The Imam, who was until then sitting down, stood up and said angrily, &#8220;Whoever holds such a viewpoint is misled.&#8221; Subhanallah! Was Imam &#8216;Ali unable to free his daughter from their clutches? He could have stood between them and her and prevented this, they have fabricated a lie &#8230; (the whole story of Umm Kulthum being replaced by Jinn and the Jinn&#8217;s marriage to Umar there-forth)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mulla Baqir Majlisi says regarding it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: There is no contradiction between this narration and the other narrations that he married his daughter Umm Kulthum, because the Imams would fear from the extremist Shias, and this is from their secrets, and because plenty of his companions didn&#8217;t believe it, this is what my father al-`Allamah has also mentioned.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the modern-day examples of this matter is that the Shia jurists declared the Najasah or physical impurity of Ahlul-Kitab, and they issued verdicts forbidding the Shia from eating their food and drinking their drinks, even bread and water. However, many of the biggest contemporary scholars hold a different opinion and they are of the opinion of Tahara or purity of Ahlul-Kitab but since they practice Taqiyya with their own followers they will not issue verdicts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhammad Jawad Mughniyyah says regarding this matter in his book &#8220;Tafsir al-Kashif&#8221; 3/18, in Surat al-Ma&#8217;edah verse #5:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Many of the biggest Shia Maraji` are of the opinion of purity, from them is al-Sayyid al-Hakeem and al-Sayyid al-Khoei who confessed his opinion secretly to those he trusts.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mughniyyah says in &#8220;Fiqh al-Imam al-Sadiq&#8221; pg33 that he met three contemporary Shia scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Sheikh Muhammad Reda Aal Yasin in Najaf, al-Sayyid Sadr al-Deen al-Sadr in Qum, and Sayyid Muhsin al-Ameen in Lebanon, and they all issued verdicts about the purity of Ahlul-Kitab but it was done secretly to those whom they trusted, and they did not declare it publicly out of fear from the trouble makers, and many of the jurists view their purity but will  not declare it out of fear from the people of ignorance, and Allah deserves to be feared more.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mughniyyah also says in &#8220;al-Jawami` wal-Fawariq bayn al-Sunnah wal-Shia&#8221; pg184:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What some Shia laymen do in Lebanon and `Iraq and Iran, from wearing shrouds and hitting their heads and foreheads with swords on the tenth of Muharram, this is a shameful habit and an innovation in the religion and the Madhab, the people of ignorance innovated it for themselves without permission from an Imam or a big scholar just like what happens in every religion or Madhab, none dared to confront this in our days except very few scholars and at their forefront is Sayyid Muhsin al-Ameen al-`Amili (ra)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of us know how Muhsin al-Ameen was attacked and cursed and refuted by Shia scholars before the laymen when he opposed Tatbeer and Zinjeer&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next we quote al-Tijani al-Samawi who talks about smoking in &#8220;Kull al-Huloul `Inda Aal al-Rassul&#8221; pg169:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I find it strange that the Maraji` of the Shia would forbid playing chess but do not forbid smoking although there is a huge difference between the harm of smoking and the harm of chess. I always hated this situation so I raised these issues many times with some scholars but never found one with sufficient courage to ban it and forbid it. I remember that al-Shaheed al-Sadr never smoked and when I asked him he replied: &#8220;I do not smoke and I advise each Muslim not to smoke.&#8221; but I never heard him explicitly forbid it. It is said that some scholars forbade it for new smokers but declared it Makruh on the average smoker, and some forbid it completely but they do not have the courage to declare it out of fear of being accused of using Qiyas. The Maraji` have to declare it explicitly and not fear anyone other than Allah, and they need to forbid it even if by their own Ijtihad, but if the scholars and Maraji` remain silent because the people will not accept it then this is a problem, or maybe they fear the reaction of the smokers so they will not declare it as Makruh and I have heard some scholars try their hardest to convince me that in it(smoking) are great benefits(for health) and this is a dangerous matter with many consequences, it has encouraged Muslim youth to smoke regularly.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IMAMS NOT PRACTICING TAQIYYA IN MORE DANGEROUS ISSUES &amp; SITUATIONS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tahtheeb al-Ahkam by Tusi 2/195 we read the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Yahya from Ahmad bin Muhammad from ibn Sinan from abu al-Jaroud: I said to abu Ja&#8217;far (as): &#8220;When do I make the two prostrations of forgetfulness?&#8221; he (as) said: &#8220;Before making Tasleem, because if you make Tasleem then your prayer is finished.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author al-Tusi commented on this narration and the others before it by saying: &#8220;These two narrations are to be considered a kind of Taqiyya, because they agree with the Madhabs of many of the `Aamah(Sunnies).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the usual case, it is the norm, the Imams being scared of everyone and trying their best not to show any signs of disagreement with Ahlul-Sunnah. I’m sure that’s the impression the readers got after reading all the previous narrations in this book. However, since the Shia back then were known to be fabricators of Hadith, there’s bound to be contradictions. They portray the Imams as being fearful scared individuals who are in constant hiding, yet at the same time they narrate the opposite of this, Ahadith that show the Imams being quite careless and exposing themselves as if all that secrecy had no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Kafi vol.5 pg.449 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi &#8216;Umayr from `Ali bin al-Hassan bin Ribat from Hariz from &#8216;Abdul-Rahman bin abi &#8216;Abdullah: I heard abu Hanifa ask abu &#8216;Abdullah (as) about Mut&#8217;ah, so he (as) said: &#8220;Which of the two you ask about?&#8221; abu Hanifa said: &#8220;I am asking about the Mut&#8217;ah of women because I already asked you about the Mut&#8217;ah of Hajj, is it correct?&#8221; he (as) replied: &#8220;Subhanallah! Have you not read in the book of Allah (swt)? : {So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compensation as an obligation.}&#8221; abu Hanifa said: &#8220;By Allah it is as if this is the first time I hear it.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi said: Hasan in al-Miraat 20/229.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Behbudi said: Sahih in Sahih-ul-Kafi 3/45.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Sadiq who practiced Taqiyya more than any other Imam in their book wasn&#8217;t just talking to a any random ignorant Muslim in the streets, nor was he talking about a small minor issue, he is talking about one of the biggest differences of Fiqh which is Mut`ah. And yet, he openly exposes his beliefs, casually I might add, in front of the leader of the scholars of Baghdad and the head of one of the four Madhabs Imam abu Hanifa al-Nu`man, a man who had thousands of followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOT PRACTICING TAQIYYA IS ALSO TAQIYYA ACCORDING TO SHIA SCHOLARS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad bin `Ali bin al-Hussein with his Isnad, from Yahya bin abi &#8216;Imran that he said: I wrote to abu Ja&#8217;far II (as) regarding the squirrel and the fennec fox and the beaver, and I said: &#8220;May I be sacrifice for you, I would like it if you did not reply with Taqiyya in this matter.&#8221; So he wrote me with his own hand-writing: &#8220;Pray in them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(He means while wearing their skin.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">sources: al-Hadaeq al-Nadirah by Yusuf al-Bahrani (7/62-69), Mustanad al-Shia by al-Naraqi(4/321), Jawahir al-Kalam by al-Jawahiri (8/88-98), Man la Yahduruhu al-Faqih by Saduq (1/262), Wasael al-Shia by al-&#8216;Amili (3/253) &amp; (4/349).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his book &#8220;Minhaj al-Ahkam&#8221; pg.47, al-Mirza al-Qummi says while commenting on this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The questioner may have asked about the condition of a certain matter and said &#8220;What is the ruling on this? Answer me without Taqiyya?&#8221; or &#8220;Answer me with no Taqiyya.&#8221; so they (as) would answer that it is so and so, but this is also Taqiyya.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This means the Shia are in so much doubt, that they cannot know for sure if the Imam is doing Taqiyya or if it’s a trick to fool their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PRAYING ON DEAD MUSLIMS AS TAQIYYA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Tusi in &#8220;Tahtheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; vol.1 pg.335:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our sheikh (Mufid) may Allah strengthen him says: &#8220;It is not permissible for any of the believers(Twelvers) to wash anyone from those who differ with us in the Truth of the Wilayah (of `Ali) nor should he pray on him, unless there is a necessity in the case of Taqiyya, so he  gives him the washing of those who oppose us, and if he prays on him he curses him and does not make Du`a for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this shows that the one who opposes us is a Kafir and his ruling is that of a Kafir unless in special cases where there is proof, and if washing the Kafir is not permissible then washing the one who opposes us is also not permissible, as for praying on him it should be like the prayer of the Prophet SAWS and Ahlul-Bayt (as) on the Mounafiqoun(Hypocrites), and we will show insha-Allah the method of how that prayer in conducted.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi says in &#8220;Zadul-Mi`ad&#8221; pg.345 after mentioning the impermissibility of praying on the Kouffar and the Khawarij and the Nawasib and the Ghulat:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for those who oppose us there is a difference, between not praying on them or praying on them with only four Takbeerat and on the fourth one you curse them&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Bahrani in &#8220;al-Hadaeq al-Nadirah&#8221; 5/176:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And it is clear and is supported by the Quran which is the saying of Allah &#8220;And pray thou never over any one of them when he is dead&#8221; meaning the Kouffar, and he who differs with the people of Truth(Twelvers) is a Kafir and there is no disagreement on this among us.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Qummi al-Saduq says what Du`a should be made upon the Mukhalif(Sunni) when he dies during Salat al-Janaza, we read in &#8220;Fiqh al-Rida&#8221; pg178:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And if the dead person is a Mukhalif(Sunni) then say in your fourth Takbeera &#8211; O Allah, disappoint your slave and the son of your slave &#8211; O Allah let him into your fire &#8211; O Allah make him taste your most painful punishment &#8211; O Allah surround him with fire and fill his insides with fire &#8211; O Allah tighten his grave &#8211; for he was an enemy of your friends and a friend of your enemies &#8211; O Allah do not reduce his torture and pour your torment on him &#8211; So when his Janazah is lifted say: &#8220;O Allah do not raise him nor give him virtue&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And their scholar abu Salah al-Halabi (died 447 AH) says in his book also called &#8220;al-Kafi lil-Halabi&#8221; pg157:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And if he was from those who oppose the truth, like a Mujabbir or a Mushabbih or a Mu`tazili or a Khariji or a denier of Imamah, then he curses him after the fourth and leaves. Prayer on them is not allowed except in Taqiyya.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IMAMS CONFUSING THEIR OWN SHIA WITH TAQIYYA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia narrations prove without the shadow of a doubt that the infallible Shia Imams are a source of misguidance to their own followers before anyone else, let’s see why with our own eyes from al-Kafi …</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ahmad ibn Idris from Muhamad ibn ‘Abdul-Jabbar from al-Hassan ibn `Ali from Tha’alabah ibn Maymoun from Zurarah ibn A’ayun that he said: I asked Imam al-Baqir (as) a question so the Imam gave me the answer then another man came and asked the same question so the Imam gave him a different answer, then another one came and asked about it so the Imam gave him a completely different answer than both of us. when both men left I asked the Imam: “O son of Rassul Allah, two men from ‘Iraq and from your Shia came to ask you but you gave each of them different answers.” He replied: “O Zurarah, this is good for us so that we may remain safer because if you all agree on this then the people will believe in it and they would be guided to us but we will not remain for long.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later I said to his son al-Sadiq (as): “Your Shia always walk away from you with different opinions and answers” so he gave me the same reply as his father.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: al-Kafi 1/65.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi said: Muwaththaq like the Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Behbudi said: Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali ibn Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi Najran from ‘Assim bin Humayd from Mansour ibn Hazim who said: I said to al-Sadiq (as): “What is the matter with you, I ask a question and you give me an answer then another man comes and asks it so you give him a completely different one?” The Imam replied: “we answer people in matters of addition and deletion.” I said to him: “Then tell me about the companions of Rassul-Allah SAWS do they narrate truthful narrations or do they lie?” the Imam said: “They are truthful” I asked: “Why did they differ?” he replied: “Do you not know that a man used to come to Rassul-Allah SAWS and ask a question then he answers him but later he would answer to the same question differently because the Ahadith they abrogate each other.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: al-Kafi 1/65.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi said: Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Yusuf al-Bahrani in the introduction of his book &#8220;al-Hadaeq al-Nadirah&#8221; says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And to this points his saying (as):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;And if you(shia) all gather upon one thing then the people will believe you concerning us ect&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the Sheikh has also narrated in al-Tahtheeb in the SAHIH from Salim abu Khadeejah from abu &#8216;Abdullah (as): a man asked him (as) while I was present: &#8220;sometimes I would enter the mosque and I would see some of our companions(shia) praying &#8216;Asr while the others pray Zuhr?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he (as) replied: &#8220;I ordered them to do this because if they all prayed at the same time then our matter would be known and they would be executed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imam is very honest in his saying and in this case he did not do what the mainstream Muslims do as it is clear for them(sunnies) that the timing of both prayers are separate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also what is narrated by the sheikh in his book al-&#8216;Iddah in the Mursal from al-Sadiq (as): &#8220;He was asked about the difference among our companions in timings(of acts of worship)&#8221; he (as) responded: &#8220;I am the one who made them differ among themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what is narrated in al-Ihtijaj with its Sanad to Huraiz from abu &#8216;Abdullah (as), he said to the Imam: &#8220;There is nothing more saddening for me than the difference of our companions(shia)&#8221; the Imam (as) replied: &#8220;I did this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what he narrated in the book Ma&#8217;anee al-Akhbar from al-Khazzaz from he who told him from abu al-Hasan(as) who said: &#8220;The difference among my companions is a mercy.&#8221; and he (as) also said: &#8220;When that (appearance of Mahdi) happens I will unite you upon one thing.&#8221; and in another place he (as) was asked about the difference among our companions(Shia) so he (as) said: &#8220;I did this to you, and if you were to unite upon one matter then your heads will be taken.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what is narrated in al-Kafi with its Isnad from Musa bin Ashyam, he said: I was with abu &#8216;Abdullah (as) so a man asked him about a verse from the verses of the book of Allah almighty, he answered him then another man came and inquired about the same verse but he gave him a different answer from the first man, I then doubted him greatly &#8211; until he said &#8211; and while I was like this suddenly a man enters and asks about that same verse so he gave him an answer different from mine and my companion&#8217;s answers, so my doubts subsided and I realized this was Taqiyya.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ask the Shia who fear Allah, is this acceptable? The divine Imams who are sent from God to guide men and rule the nation are living by Taqiyya misguiding and confusing everyone?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yusuf al-Bahrani writes in his book &#8220;al-Duraral-Najafiyyah fil-Multaqatat al-Yusufiyyah&#8221;. vol.2 pg.300:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is famous among our companions may Allah be pleased with them, is that Taqiyya in their (as) narrations results from the opinions of the `Amah(Sunnies), but to me there are other reasons for this. It is that they (as) try to create difference among the Shia even if there weren&#8217;t any similar opinions from the `Amah(Sunnies). From these narrations is what Thiqat al-Islam narrated in al-Kafi, in the Muwaththaq from Zurarah, from abi Ja`far (as) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I asked him about a matter and he answered, then another man came and asked him about it and he gave a different than mine, then a third came and he gave a completely different answer. When the two men left I asked: &#8220;O son of Rassul-Allah (SAWS), two men from your Shia in `Iraq came and asked but you gave them both conflicting answers?&#8221; he (as) replied: &#8220;O Zurarah, this is goodness for us and for you, if you unite upon a matter then the people will believe (what you narrate) from us, and it would make our stay and your stay short.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he explains&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Maybe the secret to this, is that if the Shia were to differ among each other, each one narrating from his Imam what contradicts the other, then their Madhab would appear silly in the eyes of the `Amah(Sunnies), they would accuse them of lying and fabricating their narrations, and they&#8217;d  accuse them of ignorance in religion, and they&#8217;d become lowly in their eyes. On the contrary, if they agreed on one word, they&#8217;d believe them and their hatred would increase for them and their Imam and Madhab, this becomes a cause of raging enmity.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice he admits his Madhab is silly, he continues…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From that is what al-Shaykh narrated in al-Tahdheeb, in the Sahih `ala al-Dhahir, from Salim bin abi Hudhayfah, from abi `Abdillah (as), that he said: A man asked him while I was present: &#8220;Sometimes I come into the mosque and some of our companions are praying `Asr while others are praying Dhuhr.&#8221; he (as) replied: &#8220;I ordered them to do this, if they pray at one time they will be known and their heads would fall.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what al-Shaykh narrated in al-`Iddah, Mursal from the narration of al-Sadiq (as) that he was asked about the difference between our companions in timings, so he said: &#8220;I created this difference between them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what he narrated in al-Ihtijaj with his Sanad to Hurayz, from abi `Abdillah (as) that he told him: &#8220;Nothing gets to me more than the difference of our companions!&#8221; so he (as) replied: &#8220;This was caused by me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also what he narrated in the book Ma`ani al-Akhbar from al-Khazzaz, from he who told him, from abu al-Hasan (as) that he said: &#8220;The difference between my companions is a mercy for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he (as) said: &#8220;If &#8216;that&#8217; should happen I shall gather you all upon one matter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what he narrated in al-Kafi with his Sanad to Musa bin Ashiyam: I was with abu `Abdillah (as) so a man asked him about a verse from the book of Allah and he told him about it, then another one came in and asked him about the same verse but he gave a different answer, so that caused a lot of doubt in me (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) while I was sitting another one came so he gave him an answer different than mine and my companions, so I calmed down and realized it was Taqiyya on his part.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally he says&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Maybe with the help of these, you can know that trying to figure out the correct narrations of Taqiyya, is to present them to the book of Allah, and that is the strongest of means of outweighing between the evidence]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, the strongest means according to them is the weakest means, because the vast majority of topics discussed in Shia narrations are not mentioned anywhere in the Qur’an, including Imamah and the number of Imams and their qualities and their rulings in Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can the Shia believe the Imams misguide their folowers, yet at the same time believe in what al-Mufid said in &#8220;Tashih I`tiqadat al-Imamiyyah&#8221; pg.128-130:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The infallibility given by Allah to his Hujaj(Imams) is the success and grace and the protection from sins and from making mistakes in the religion of Allah most high]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What bigger mistake is there than misguiding your followers and confusing them? What good is this “grace” is they’re gonna resort to this? Wouldn’t this be better described as “curse”?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhammad Rida  al-Muzaffar says in `Aqa&#8217;id al-Imamiyyah pg.65 when discussing the qualities that the Imam of the nation must have:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (the Imam) also needs to be protected from forgetfulness and mistakes, because the Imams are the preservers of religious laws, and those who oversee it, their condition in this regard is the same as the condition of the prophet]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say, since when the Prophet (saw) so proud of creating differences and manipulating rulings to please the tyrants?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Ja`far al-Subhani says in Adwa&#8217; `ala `Aqa&#8217;id  al-Shi`ah al-Imamiyyah, pg.388:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We can prove the necessity of the Imam&#8217;s infallibility in different ways, from the most important of them:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly: The Imamah being a continuation of the function of prophet-hood and message, and since the Imam fills all the gaps which resulted by the passing of the Prophet (SAWS), then in this case he certainly needs to be infallible, because if he were to sin then it would conflict with the reason of his creation in the first place as leader of the nation. The goal is to guide the nation towards the correct path, this cannot happen unless his sayings are trusted, and unless one can be comfortable that he speaks truth. If it were allowed for the Imam to make mistakes, or forget, or sin, or contradict himself, then his words and actions cannot be trusted, and the people&#8217;s trust in him would weaken, and this contradicts the reason of his appointment&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What trust and what truth when the Imam are supposedly hell-bent on spreading lies and misguidance and deceiving even their own followers!? Truly, this contradicts the reason for their existence as guides in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IMAMS ON TAQIYYA &amp; UNRELIABLE FOLLOWERS MEANS NO RELIGION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We read now that the followers of the Imams, to see what type of people they were.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Kafi 2/242, is a Hadith judged as &#8220;Hasan kal-Sahih&#8221; by Majlisi in &#8220;al-Mir&#8217;aat&#8221; 9/286:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From ibn Ri&#8217;aab that he heard abu `Abdullah (as) say to abu Baseer: &#8220;By Allah, if I were to find among you three believers who keep my narrations secret, I would not have allowed myself to keep my narrations a secret from you.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">abu `Abdillah here is Ja`far, as you can see he couldn&#8217;t even find three pious reliable people from among his companions and followers, so he kept his narrations a secret. We ask how then does al-Kafi contain around 16,000 narrations mostly from Ja`far? I hope the reader can see through their lies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Sayyed Ni&#8217;imatullah al-Jazaeri says in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When al-Sadiq (a) was asked by his companions about al-Qaem (a) and that they wish to meet him, he would say: &#8220;You have to be diligent and you have to be patient, with this you will receive the rewards of Jihad even if you die on your beds.&#8221; Although even if they remained until his appearance (a) only a small minority among them will support him  like what happened with al-Husein (a) and the Shia of his father who wrote for him and when he came to them they &#8220;handed him over to be killed&#8221; and I wished that they stopped there but they even supported his oppressors.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: al-Anwar al-Nu&#8217;umaniyyah 2/35.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Until he apparently gathered supporters so he called to Jihad and prepared for battle and headed with his children and family from the sanctuary of Rassul-Allah SAWS towards &#8216;Iraq to seek the aid and support of his Shia who called on him, before him his cousin Muslim ibn &#8216;Aqeel went to get their pledge of allegiance and to call to the cause of Allah, the people of Kufa gave him the pledge and oaths and the promises and they guaranteed him victory, it did not take long though before they turned on him and broke their pledge, they let him down and handed him over so he was killed in between them and they did not aid him, then they went to fight against al-Husein (a), they surrounded him and prevented him from fleeing and cornered him in an area where he could not escape, they prevented him from drinking the water of the river of Furat and when they saw the chance they killed him.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: Tareekh al-Aimmah min Athar al-Qudamaa min &#8216;Ulemaa al-Imamiyah, pages 289-290 printed by the order of grand ayatullah Shihab-ul-Deen al-Mir&#8217;ashi al-Najafi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A man came to `Ali bin al-Hussein (a) and said: I preferred Jihad over Hajj, and Allah had said: &#8220;Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise.&#8221; `Ali said to him: &#8220;read what comes after it&#8221; the man said: &#8220;the repentant, the worshippers, the praisers [of Allah], the travelers [for His cause], those who bow and prostrate [in prayer], those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who observe the limits [set by] Allah.&#8221; so `Ali said: When you meet these people then Jihad with them would be better than Hajj.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: Man la Yahduruhu al-Faqih.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is meant by this is that Jihad has conditions such as ability and loyalty and he meant that if we had followers who would stick true to their promises then we will make Jihad, the Imams (a) never had such followers like the ones with the qualities mentioned in the verse.]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of the book said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He wore it as Taqiyya but he told Huthayfah bin Mansour because he trusted him and a group of Shia came to him asking him about wearing black but he did not trust them in keeping his secret so he used Taqiyya with them.]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu &#8216;Abdullah (a) said: my father told me and he was a great father: &#8220;If I found three who are trustworthy I would have given them knowledge that they would no longer need to look into matters of Halal and Haram or anything else until our Qaem (a) rises.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">sources: basaer al-darajat 1/478, Bihar al-Anwar 3/213.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WAS IT TAQIYYA OR SOMETHING ELSE?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I will quote from the book of one of the Shia scholars of Hadith &#8220;Muhyee al-Deen al-Musawi al-Ghurayfi&#8221; in his book &#8220;Qawa&#8217;ed al-Hadith&#8221; starting from page 135:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8220;And that many of the narrations were not told by the Imams (as) but they were fabricated by liars who attributed them to the Imams by inserting them into the books of their companions or by other means (1). And of course they must have placed for these narrations or to most of them authentic chains of narrators so that they may be accepted. And as we cannot tell the difference between both groups of narrations, I mean the fabricated ones and the ones issued by Taqiyya and we have no way of making a distinction so how can we still work with the narrations of authentic chains with the possibility of them being from that group?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abandoning the authentic narrations of Ahlul-Bayt (as) is definitely wrong as we cannot know their rulings except through these narrations , which is why we must return to our early Fuqahaa (scholars) as they have lots of evidence to make the distinction between the narrations, their knowledge proves that a narration is not from that group and if the chain is good then we work with it as a Hujjah, while others could have strong chains but since it is suspected of being from that group then it is dropped and abandoned.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the footnotes the Muhaqiq(Researcher) of the book writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(1): As the Imams of Ahlul-Bayt (as) were forced to use Taqiyya they also had a group of Zanadiqah and liars who tried their best to fabricate narrations and attribute them to the Imams (as). al-Kashshi narrated with its Isnad to Muhammad bin &#8216;Isa that he said: some of our companions asked Yunus bin &#8216;Abdul-Rahman while I was present so he said to him: O Abu Muhammad you are very strict in Hadith and you reject a lot of what our companions narrate, why is this? He said: Hisham bin al-Hakam told me that he heard Abu &#8216;Abdullah say: DO NOT ACCEPT FROM US A HADITH EXCEPT THAT WHICH AGREES WITH THE QURAN AND THE SUNNAH, OR THAT YOU FIND EVIDENCE FROM OUR EARLY NARRATIONS, BECAUSE AL-MUGHEERAH BIN SA&#8217;EED (LA) HAS INSERTED INTO THE BOOKS OF THE COMPANIONS OF MY FATHER THAT WHICH HE DID NOT NARRATE, SO FEAR ALLAH AND DO NOT ACCEPT FROM US THAT WHICH CONTRADICTS WITH OUR LORD AND WITH THE SUNNAH OF THE PROPHET (SAWS)&#8230;Yunus said&#8230;I took their books then presented them to Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Reda (as) so he rejected many narrations as they could not be narrated by Abu &#8216;Abdullah (as) and he told me: ABU AL-KHATTAB HAS LIED ON ABU &#8216;ABDULLAH (as) MAY ALLAH CURSE ABU AL-KHATTAB AND ALSO HIS COMPANIONS WHO INSERT THESE FAKE NARRATIONS UNTIL OUR VERY DAY IN THE BOOKS OF ABU &#8216;ABULLAH ect&#8230; (al-Hadaeq 1/8)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia popular scholar Hashim Ma`rouf al-Husayni says in &#8220;al-Mawdou`at fil-Athar wal-Akhbar&#8221; pg150:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The authentic narrations of Imam al-Sadiq confirm with certainty and so do the narrations of other Imams, that al-Mugheerah bin Sa`eed and Bayan and Sa&#8217;id al-Nahdayn and `Umar al-Nabti and al-Mufaddal and other deviants of Tashayyu` and agents, that they inserted between the narrations of the Imams a big number of fabrications in all topics.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was narrated by al-Mugheerah that he said: &#8220;I fabricated and inserted into the narration of Ja`far bin Muhammad twelve thousand Hadith.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Him and his followers remained for a long time within the folds of Tashayyu`, they used to visit the Imams with them and were never exposed until after the fundamental primary books of Hadith were filled with their narrations as stated by Yahya bin Humayd.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ikhtiyar Ma`rifat al-Rijal by Tusi 2/616, we read:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Kashshi, from Hamani: I said to Shareek: “Some people claim that Ja`far bin Muhammad (as) is weak in Hadih!” Shareek replied: “Let me tell you the story behind this, Ja`far was a pious righteous man, unfortunately he was surrounded by ignorant folks who enter on him and see his lectures then they leave saying: ‘Ja`far narrated to us such and such’ so they’d narrate lies and falsehoods and attribute it to Ja`far in order to take people’s money and rob them such as al-Mufaddal bin `Umar, Banan, `Amro al-Nabti and others.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- “Taqiyya” as a name is shared by both the Sunni and Shi`ee Madhab, but the purpose and function is completely different. In Islam, making Taqiyya is uttering Kufr and hiding Iman in necessary situation. In Tashayyu`, Taqiyya is showing Iman and hiding Kufri beliefs such as Shirk and Ghuluw and Tahreef  and Takfeer of the Sahabah and other evil matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Taqiyya in Tashayyu` is not an exception or a dispensation(Rukhsah) in case of necessity, rather it in itself is a necessity and is obligatory, he who leaves it is like he who left prayer, it is not permissible to drop it until the Mahdi or 12<sup>th</sup> Imam rises and is a tool to get closer to their opponents and earn their trust in order to convert them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Taqiyya in Islam is fundamentally practiced against the Kouffar, as for Taqiyya in Tashayyu` then it is essentially against Ahlul-Sunnah, they differ on whether it can be used against Kouffar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Those who established the belief of Taqiyya in the Shi`ee Madhab wished to divide the nation and to further separate the Shia from the rest of the Muslims, it is to save their belief in infallibility and to avoid telling their followers that their sources are forged and unreliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Those who fabricated narrations ordering the Shia to keep their beliefs secret, and praising those who never announce their true beliefs, they are the deviants who infiltrated the school of Ahlul-Bayt and wished to keep their falsehood hidden and their reality concealed so they may not be exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- The narrations in which the Imams cursed the liars and deviants and extremists were all covered up by the excuse that the Imams only cursed these men to protect them from danger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- The life of the scholars of Ahlul-Bayt which is recorded in history books opposes Taqiyya, they were all honest and truthful and brave, nothing in their lives agrees with the principals of Taqiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Even according to Shia standards, the narrations praising Taqiyya and encouraging it and warning from abandoning it, they are all mainly un-authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9- Many of the narrations of Taqiyya cannot be explained in clear and convincing ways as is apparent from Tusi’s failed attempts to reconcile, which is why some deviants fabricated narrations accusing the Imams of intentionally misguiding the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10- Shia scholars have admitted that a lot of the rulings of the school of Ahlul-Bayt were lost because of Taqiyya, and that they differ in one issue on more than twenty or thirty opinions, this led to many Shia abandoning their Madhab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11- They permitted that Taqiyya be used between the Shia as they never trust each other and their scholars always try to offer religious verdicts to please the laymen out of fear from being harmed or losing status, authority and popularity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12- They have to resort to the reasoning and fallible deduction skills of their scholars in order to know the true religion, which deprives the nation from infallible guidance and defeats the purpose of Imamah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Praise be to Allah and glory be to him, and may His peace and blessings shower our Prophet Muhammad and his family, companions and followers until the day of judgment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a lengthy article divided into three parts.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.</strong> New phenomena: Outright rejection of the very existence of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/09/18/abdullah-ibn-saba-the-book/" rel="external nofollow">Ibn Saba</a>’ by contemporary Shia scholars and propagandists.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong> Ibn Saba’ the Jew in Shia books – an unknown reality to many Shias.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>3.</strong> Shia Objection: Ibn Saba’ did exist, but Tashayyu’ (Shiism) and the Imamite sect are innocent of him.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Sunni and Shia authorities were agreed upon (the existence and reality of Abdullah bin Saba’ (although the Shia sect of course tries to deny that the foundation of Rafhd/rejectionist was taken from a Jew) until the Orientalists such as Bernard Lewis, Julius Wellhausen, Friedlander, and Caetani Leone started to cast doubt about the existence of Abdullah bin Saba’, and they were followed in that by ignorants such as Taha Hussain, Muhammad Kaamil Hussain, Adnan Ibrahim and other pro-Shia Sunnis. Needless to say that the Rafidha scholars jumped on the wagon and (in contrary to their forefathers) suddenly claimed that Ibn Saba’ is actually a myth created by the evil Umayyads to tarnish the reputation of the Shias (a claim by the likes of Murtadha Al-’Askari, Muhammad Aal Kashif Al-Ghita etc.). Prior to 1300H (1900CE) there was no dispute about this matter at all. The contemporary Shia found in the writings of those Orientalists what was the delight of the eye and thus they began authoring in order to cast doubt about the existence of Abdullah bin Saba’, as this would allow them to dismiss a large part of the criticism against them and their sect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contemporary Shia scholars  have written books in regards to this topic, the most famous (nearly on every Rafidhi propaganda website) one might be the apologetic work of ‘Ayatollah’ Murtadha Al-’Askari named:</p>
<p>“ABDUL-AH IBN SABA AND OTHER MYTHS”.</p>

<p>Of course his book has been refuted (academically) by a number of scholars, such as:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saaid.net/bahoth/43.htm" rel="external nofollow">Dr. Sami Ataa’ Hassan – “‘Abdallah Ibn Saba the Yemenite Jew, between reality and imagination”</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly none of the books that refute the above Shia book were translated to other languages. However, we shall provide a sufficient refutation in this article inshaAllah.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #800000;">1. <em>New phenomena: Outright rejection of the very existence of Ibn Saba’ by a contemporary Shia scholars and propagandists. </em></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTION BY SHIAS:</strong> “Ibn Saba’ is a myth created by the Umayyads. The only person who narrated the story of Ibn Saba’ is Sayf Ibn Omar Al-Tamimi, a well known liar according to Sunni Hadithists themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>RESPONSE:</h2>
<p>As a matter of fact – and we shall prove that, by the permission of Allah – Sunni narrations in regards to the existence of Ibn Saba’ have not been narrated through Sayf Ibn Omar Al-Tamimi only. In fact this is a myth (an actual myth) propagated by the contemporary Shias around the world. Let us take for example of the most infamous Shia propaganda websites on the net, namely &#8220;al-Islam.org&#8221; which says (in the online version of Murtadha Al-Askari’s “Ibn Saba’ and other myths”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fabricated stories around the character of Abdullah Ibn Saba are the malicious production of one of the disciples of the devil, namely Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Saba did not exist at that time, not even in the imagination of Saif Ibn Umar al-Tamimi who invented this character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for those few traditions which have the chain of narrators (independent of Sayf), they provide a much different story which do not support any of the allegations of Sayf. These traditions picture an accursed man whom Ahlul-Bayt have declared their innocence from what he attributed to Imam Ali (declaring Ali as God). The Shia, their Imams and their scholars declare the curse of Allah to that man (if ever existed) he was lost, misguided and cursed. There is nothing in common between us [Shias] and his name except our curse on him and all other extremists who believed in deity of Ahlul-Bayt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us break down the major claims of those Shia who completely deny the existence of Ibn Saba’, as their ‘Ayatollah’ Al-’Askari did:</p>
<p>A)<strong> As for those ‘few’ traditions which have the chain of narrators independent of Sayf, they do not support any of the allegations of Sayf, hence there is nothing in common between the Shia beliefs and the personality of Ibn Saba’</strong></p>
<p>B) <strong>Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi invented the character of Ibn Saba&#8217; (he has been weakened by Sunni Hadithists experts)</strong></p>
<p>Let us analyse the so called ‘few’ narrations that according to Al-’Askari and other Shia propagandists do not support any of Sayf’s narrations and most importantly do not reflect any link between Shia beliefs and the beliefs that were propagated by the Jew Ibn Saba’.</p>
<h2>Reports about Abdullah Ibn Saba which were NOT transmitted through Sayf Ibn Omar:</h2>
<p><strong>Narration #1</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>جاء في ( طوق الحمامة ) ليحيى بن حمزة الزبيدي عن سويد بن غفلة الجعفي الكوفي المتوفى عام (80هـ/699م) أنه دخل على علي-رضي الله عنه- في إمارته، فقال: إني مررت بنفر يذكرون أبا بكر و عمر بسوء، ويروون أنك تضمر لهما مثل ذلك، منهم عبد الله بن سبأ، فقال علي: مالي ولهذا الخبيث الأسود، ثم قال : معاذ الله أن أضمر لهما إلا الحسن الجميل، ثم أرسل إلى ابن سبأ فسيره إلى المدائن، ونهض إلى المنبر، حتى اجتمع الناس أثنى عليهما خيرا، ثم قال : إذا بلغني عن أحد أنه يفضلني عليهما جلدته حد المفتري &#8211;</p>
<p>الهي ظهير، إحسان، السنة والشيعة، نشر إدارة ترجمة السنة- الهور.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In ‘Tuq Al-Hamamh’ by Yahya bin Hamzah Al-Zobaydi on the authority of bin Ghaflah Al-Jo’fi Al-Kufi (80H) who said that he entered upon Ali – may Allah be pleased with him and said: ‘I passed by some men. among them was Abdallah Ibn Saba’, who were talking negatively about Abu Bakr and Omar <strong>saying that </strong><strong>you [Ali] hold the same feelings towards them.’ Ali replied: ‘</strong>What does this wretched black man (Ibn Saba’s mother was Ethiopian) want from me?’ He then said: <strong>“I seek refuge in Allah in holding anything but beautiful respect for them both.”</strong> Then he sent after Ibn Saba and exiled him to Al-Mada’in (former capital of the Persian empire) and ascended the pulpit until the people were gathered, he then praised Abu Bakr and Omar, then he said: ‘<strong>If it reaches me that anyone prefers me over them then I shall lash them as they do with the slandering liar.’</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: This very same narration has been narrated by through different channels with authentic chains such as in:</p>
<p>‘Al-Seerah’ by Abu Ishaq al-Fizari who narrates almost the same narration above on the authority of Shu’ubah from Salamah bin Kaheel from abu Al-Za’araa from Zaid ibn Wahb. The grading: narrators are trustworthy.  Al-Khateeb made Takhreej for it in “al-Kifayah” p. 376 and said that Abu ‘Abdullah al-Boushanji graded it as Sahih, Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah al-Imam said in the commentary: It is narrated through other chains, it is Thabit. It’s last part i.e. Abu Bakr and Omar being the best of this Ummah as stated by Ali himself is Mutawatir.</p>
<h2 id="post-8327">Also note that all the major figures of the Ahl Al-Bayt throughout history reacted similar to Ali Ibn Abi Talib:</h2>
<p>Zaid bin Ali bin Al-Hussein (Zayn Al-Abidin) bin Ali Ibn Abi Talib (RA) 80-122H. Leader of Alid revloution in Iraq against the Umayyads during the era of Ibn Abdil-Malik. He was betrayed by by the Kufan (Shias) when he refused to testify against Abu Bakr and Omar (RA). After he was betrayed he was compelled to fight the Umayyad army with only five hundred soldiers, where he died at that battle.</p>
<blockquote><p>طلبة الرافضة من زيد ابن علي التبرؤ من أبو بكر و عمر فقال: إنهما وزيرا جدي, فقالوا له: إذا نرفضك, فقال لهم: إذهبوا فأنتم الرافضة.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Rafidha amongst the Shia told Zaid bin ‘Ali ibn Al-Hussein (RA) during his revolution that he has to abandon the love of Abu Bakr and Omar and he replied: “They are the companions of my grandfather”, they said to him: “Then we shall refuse you” so he said:”Go! for you are Al-Rafidah).”</p>
<p>[Tu’oun Rafidat al-Yaman fi Sahabat al-Rassul, p17 by Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah al-Imam and he said: SAHIH]</p>
<p>Similar report is present in Shia book:</p>
<p>Zaid bin ‘Ali ibn Al-Hussein (RA) who holds an honor of very pious and respectable personality among the Shias was asked by his companions about Abu Bakar (RA) and Omar (RA),he replied: I always speak good of them and<strong> I have never heard any members of the family of the Prophe (SAWS) speak badly of them</strong>. They have never <strong>persecuted us nor did they maltreat any other citizen</strong>. Both of them strictly followed the Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet (SAWS). Hearing this they said you are not our companion , they separated from him. He said today they have left us , from today they will be called Rafidha<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>(Nasikh al tawaarikh vol 2, page 590.(under the heading zain ul abedin’s saying) this book is popular and regarded as a reliable shiah document, see ayyan ush shiah (vol 2) page 132)</p>
<p>Ja’far bin Muhammad (Al-Sadiq), from his Father Muhammad bin Ali (al Baqir), from Abdullah ibn Ja’far bin Abi Talib that he said: ” Abu Bakr Al-Siddeeq may Allah be pleased with him became our Caliph<strong> and he was the best of the Caliphs of Allah, he was most merciful and most caring towards us</strong>. “</p>

<p><strong>Hadith grading:</strong> Al-Hakim said SAHIH and al-Dhahabi agreed with him, Ibn Hajar al Asqalani said the Hadith has a good chain of narrators.</p>
<p>Abu Abdullah Ja’afar bin Muhammad (Al-Sadiq) said: “Allah has disassociated himsel<strong>f from those who have disassociated themselves from Abu Bakr and Omar</strong>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>قال الذهبي : قلت: هذا القول متواتر عن جعفر الصادق، أشهد بالله إنه لبار في قوله غير منافق لأحد، فقبح الله الرافضة</p></blockquote>
<p>Hadith Grading: Imam al Dhahabi (RH) said while commenting on the narration: “This saying is Mutawatir  from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, I bear witness in front of Allah that he is honest in his saying and not lying in front of anyone (Taqiyah), may Allah increase the Rafidah in ugliness”.</p>

<p><strong>Narration #2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>أخرج ابن عساكر عن زيد بن وهب الجهني الكوفي المتوفى عام (90هـ/709م) قال: (قال علي بن أبي طالب: مالي ولهذا الخبيث الأسود-يعني عبد الله بن سبأ- و كان يقع في أبي بكر و عمر</p>
<p>ابن عساكر، مختصر تاريخ دمشق، مرجع سابق، م 12، ص 222</p></blockquote>
<p>Ibn ‘Asakir (Tarikh Dimashq) narrates on the authority of Zayd bin Wahb Al-Johayni Al-Kufi (90H) who said: ‘Ali said, “What do I have to do with this wicked black man?!’ He meant Abdallah bin Saba’ who used to attack Abu Bakr and Omar.</p>
<p>NOTE: This narration can also be found in ‘Tarikh Ibn Abi Khaythama’ with trustworthy narrators.</p>
<p><strong>Narration #3</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>– أخبرنا أبو محمد بن طاوس وأبو يعلى حمزة بن الحسن بن المفرج ، قالا: أنا أبو القاسم بن أبي العلاء ، نا أبو محمد بن أبي نصر ، أنا خيثمة بن سليمان ، نا أحمد بن زهير بن حرب ، نا عمرو بن مرزوق أنا شعبة ، عن سلمة بن كهيل عن زيد قال : قال علي بن أبي طالب : مالي ولهذا الحميت الأسود ؟ يعني عبد الله ابن سبأ وكان يقع في أبي بكر وعمر.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the authority of Abu Muhammad bin Tawoos and Abu Ya’la Hamza bin Al-Hassan bin Al-Faraq who said: ‘[&#8230;] on the authority of Salamah bin Kohayl who narrated from Zayd who said: ‘: ‘Ali said, “What do I have to do with this wicked black man?!’ He meant Abdallah bin Saba’ who used to attack Abu Bakr and Omar.</p>
<p>Grading: Has a good Sanad of trustworthy narrators.</p>
<p><strong>Narration #4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>6- أخبرنا أبو المظفر بن القشيرى ، أنا أبو سعد الجنزروذى ، أنا أبوعمرو ابن حمدان ، وأخبرنا أبو سهل محمد بن إبراهيم بن سعدويه ، أنا أبو يعلى الموصلي ، نا أبو كريب محمد بن العلاء الهمداني , نا محمد أبن الحسن الأسدى ، نا هارون بن صالح الهمداني ، عن الحارث أبن عبد الرحمن عن أبي الجلاس ، قال : سمعت عليا يقول لعبد الله السبئي : ويلك والله ما أفضي إلي بشيء كتمه أحداً من الناس ، ولقد سمعته يقول : أن بين يدي الساعة ثلاثين كذابا وإنك لا حدهم . قالا : وانا أبو يعلى ، نا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة ، نا محمد أبن الحسن ، زاد أبن المقرىء الأسدي بإسناده مثله .</p></blockquote>
<p>‘Ali tells ibn Saba’: ‘Woe to you! by Allah he (Prophet) did not tell me anything that he kept hidden from others, I heard him say that from now until the hour there will be thirty liars and you are one of them.”</p>
<p>Grading: Some of the narrators have been criticized but it has been narrated through several other chains with better narrators.</p>
<p><strong>Narration #5</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>7- أخبرنا أبو بكر أحمد بن المظفر بن الحسين بن سوسن التمار في كتابة ، وأخبرني أبو طاهر محمد بن محمد بن عبد الله السبخي بمرو ، عنه ، أنا أبو علي بن شاذان ، نا أبو بكر محمد بن عبد الله بن يونس أبو الأحوص عن مغيرة عن سماك قال : بلغ عليا أن ابن السواد ينتقض أبا بكر وعمر ، فدعا به ودعا بالسيف أو قال فهم بقتله فكلم فيه فقال : لايساكني ببلد أنا فيه ، قال : فسير إلى المدائن .</p></blockquote>
<p>Al-Sammak says: It had reached ‘Ali that Ibn Al-Sawda (nickname given to Ibn Saba’) was attacking Abu Bakr and ‘Omar so he called on him and he called for a sword but they talked him out of killing him so he said: “By Allah he will never live with me in the same city” and he was exiled to al-Madaen.</p>
<p>Grading: Has trustworthy narrators but al-Sammak who is a follower in al-Kufa could not have heard it directly from ‘Ali.</p>
<p><strong>Narration #6</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>8 – أنبأنا أبو بكر محمد بن طرخان بن بلتكين بن يحكم ، أنا أبو الفضائل محمد أبن أحمد بن عبد الباقي بن طوق ، قال : قرىء على أبي القاسم عبيدالله ابن علي أبن عبيد الله الرقي ، نا أبو أحمد عبيد الله بن محمد أبن أبى مسلم ، أنا أبو عمر محمد بن عبد الواحد ، أخبرني الغطافي ، عن رجاله ، عن الصادق عن آبائه الطاهرين عن جابر قال : لما بويع علي خطب الناس فقام إليه عبد الله بن سبأ فقال له : أنت دابة الأرض ، قال فقال له : اتق الله ، فقال له : أنت الملك ، فقال له : اتق الله ، فقال له : أنت خلقت الخلق ، وبسطت الرزق ، فأمر بقتله ، فاجتمعت الرافضة فقالت : دعه وانفه إلى ساباط المدائن فإنك إن قتلته بالمدينة خرجت أصحابه علينا وشيعته ، فنفاه إلي ساباط المدائن فثم القرامطة والرافضة ، قال : ثم قامت إليه طائفة وهم السبئية وكانوا أحد عشر رجلا فقال أرجعوا فإني علي بن أبي طالب أبي مشهور وأمي مشهورة ، وانا أبن عم محمد صلي الله عليه وسلم فقالوا لا نرجع ، دع داعيك فأحرقهم بالنار ، وقبورهم في صحراء أحد عشر مشهورة فقال من بقي ممن لم يكشف رأسه منهم علينا : أنه إله ، واحتجوا بقول ابن عباس : ” لا يعذب بالنار إلا خالقها ” . قال ثعلب : وقد عذب بالنار قبل علي أبو بكر الصديق شيخ الإسلام رضي الله عنه وذاك أنه رفع إليه رجل يقال له : الفجأة وقالوا إنه شتم النبي صلي الله عليه وسلم بعد وفاته ، فأخرجه إلى الصحراء فأحرقه بالنار . قال فقال ابن عباس : قد عذب أبو بكر بالنار فاعبدوه أيضا.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Ali stood as a Khateeb amongst the people after Bay’ah then Ibn Saba’ went to him and said: You are the beast of the earth, Ali said: fear Allah! so Ibn Saba said: You are Al-Malik, Ali said: Fear Allah! so Ibn Saba said:<strong> you created the creations and offered the bounties</strong>, So ‘Ali ordered that he be killed but the Rafidhah told ‘Ali: leave him be it is better if you exile him to al-Madaen in Yemen otherwise his Shias and followers will rebel against us…until the end of the narration.</p>
<p>Grading: All narrators are trustworthy except for one unknown narrator called al-Ghattafi who has not been documented, could be a mistake in copying the name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were  six reports in Sunni books alone about Abdullah Ibn Saba which were NOT transmitted through Sayf Ibn Omar. Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamad al-’Awdah graded these narrations in his book ”‘<em>Abdullah bin Saba’ wa Atharuhu fi Ahdath al-Fitnah fi Sadr al-Islam</em>“ ”عبد الله بن سبأ و أثره في أحداث الفتنة في صدر الإسلام ” in total he quotes eight narrations which in return all strenghten the narrations of Sayf Ibn Omar. There is no doubt that Sabaite beliefs have been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt and the prove according to Sunni narrations are the facts stating in the narrations above, let us make a summary:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sabaism:</strong></span> Ali held grudge against his fellow Sahaba, particularly Abu Bakr and Omar. He ascribed this belief of Ali and his excuse was that he is merely doing it out of ‘love for the Ahl Al-Bayt and hatred towards their enemies’ (Tawalli and Tabari).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Rafidhi Shiism:</strong></span> Rafdh (rejectionism) represented by countless sects (today’s mostly made up by Twelver Shias) is the only sect that propagates the very same Sabaite belief that Ali held grudge against Abu Bakr and Omar and the Sahaba, Ali hated them and they were the enemies of the Ahl Al-Bayt and it is a sign of love to hate them (Sahaba) since they were Ali’s enemies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Reality (Islam):</span> </strong>Ali did not just reject those beliefs attributed to him, he in fact seeked refuge in Allah and was about to execute Ibn Saba’ for propagating such beliefs in his (Ali’s name) and  under the excuse of ‘loving the Ahl Al-Bayt and hating their enemies’. He deported Ibn Saba’ and threatened everyone who prefers him (Ali) over Abu Bakr and Omar with lashes as they do with the slandering liar.</p>
<p>As you can see, the claim that there is “nothing in common” between Shias (Rafidha who by defenition are REJECTORS of the absolute majority of the Sahaba) and the beliefs propagated by Ibn Saba’ and reported by Sayf Ibn Omar (AND others …) is plain and simply not true, in fact Rafdhi Shiism throughout history always propagated the Sabaite belief that Ali hated Abu Bakr and Omar and the Sahaba. So there is a link between Ibn Saba’s  lie and what the Rafidha have wrongly ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt. This is why Sunni scholars rightly state that:</p>
<p>“<strong>The foundation of Al-Rafd is taken from the Jews</strong>.”</p>
<p>We need to be precise about our words and thus we believe that slogans like “Shiism was created by a Jew” are not accurate (enough), for  there is no unified monolithic “Shiaism”, in fact Shiism (Tashayyu’) had different meanings throughout Islamic history:</p>
<p>Al-Dhahabi says: “The Ghaali (extremist) Shiite in the time of the Salaf (first three Muslims generations) and according to them is those that speak against Othman, Al-Zubair, Talha, Mu’awiyah, and those that fought Ali (RA), and attacked them”. (Al-Mizan, 1/118)</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar in his Muqaddamah of “Al-Huda Al-Sari”:</p>
<blockquote><p>والتشيع محبة علي وتقديمه على الصحابة فمن قدمه على أبي بكر وعمر فهو غال في تشيعه</p></blockquote>
<p>“And Tashayyu’ (Shiism) means having love for Ali and PREFERRING him over the Sahabah [in general], as for those who preferred him (Ali) even over Abu Bakr and Omar then they were the EXTREMIST (Ghulat) Shia”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to remind the readers that the Shia of the past were different than today&#8217;s Shia. al-Shaykh al-Muhadith Shuaib al-Arnawut talks about the Shia of the past, as was recorded by one of his students from Turkey, Anbiya Yildirim.</p>
<p>It is taken from book of Anbiya Yildirim “Hadisler ve zihinlerdeki sorular” (p 269), printed by Ragbet in Turkey.</p>
<p>Shaykh Shuaib (hafizahullah) said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for takfir from modern shias toward some (people from) Ashara al-Mubashara, (and they saying that) “Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Sad were disbelievers. Only Ali, Fatima and their two sons saved from disbelief”, when modern shias didn’t exist, this hadith (about 10 which were gladden by heaven) was in our books.  When was written “Musnad” and “Saheeh al-Bukhari” shias were not like shias of our time.  In that time when (someone said that such and such person) was shia, that mean he loved Ali more than Abu Bakr. There is nothing in love; man can love someone more than other.  (In the past) there was no scientist (meaning) of tashayu like in this time.  There was no ghulat (extreme view between shias) in the time of the mutakadimin.  They (ghulat) emerged after the 4-th year of hijra. I can show you bios of shia narrators, there are shias of fist generation in Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad.  So, Ahmad ibn Hanbal died in 241 h, and this hadith (about Ashara al-Mubashara) was recorded long time before his death.<br />
So, before shias distinguished from ahlesunnah, (before) they made themselves as independent school, (before) they took idea that they believe in, as a (major) point of their movement, these ahadeth (about companions which were gladden by paradise) took their place in books.  Did in that time were shias like these, so (someone could claim) that this hadith (about Ashara al-Mubashara) was fabricated (in attempt) to  protect (companions) from their charges?  So issue of takfir of muteahirin shias didn’t present in the time of mutakadimin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Shia in the past were by no means like the Twelvers today, yet nevertheless they were considered extremists (so what would the likes of Ibn Hajar and Al-Dhahabi call the Rafidha of today?!) for simply propagating and holding the belief that Ali is superior to Abu Bakr and Omar (a nonsense belief, for Mutawatir narrations prove without a shadow of a doubt that Ali believed in the superiority of Abu Bakr and Omar over himself). Shiism in its evolution reached the peak and propagated what Shias propagate to this very day namely that it was part of Ali’s belief that Abu Bakr and Omar are his enemies, so were the Sahaba and everyone else who rejected Ali as their so called him. Shiism today is propagated what Ibn Saba’ claimed and what Ali rejected, and based on that Ibn Saba’ is the spiritual father of Rafidhism and not that he literally created each and every aspect of the Shia sect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rhetorical slips and a tendency not to be exact in our words is something that the enemies of the Ahl Al-Sunnah do take advantage of but every sane person should understand what is meant with the statement above and the message of this article which is that the foundation of Shiism (like Takfeer of the Sahaba, particularly Abu Bakr and Omar) is not a belief of the Ahl Al-Bayt, rather a Jewish belief that has been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt by a Yemenite Jew.</p>
<p>Now that the Shia MYTH has been debunked, namely that the personality of Ibn Saba’ was invented by the Umayyad Sayf Ibn Omar and narrated by him only, let us also provide you with some additional information, InshaAllah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>al-islam org (citing Al-’Askari’s) book claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>It appears that al-Tabari was the first who reported the story of Ibn Saba from Sayf, and then other historians quoted al-Tabari in this regard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Al-’Askari and Shia propagandists are wrong (again) for over fifty years before Al-Tabari, namely by Al-Thakafi who wrote the book “Al Gharat”, Ibn Saba’ was also mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>دخل عمرو بن الحمد وحجر بن عدي وحبة العوفي والحارث الاعور<strong> وعبد الله بن سبأ</strong> على أمير المؤمنين… –  الغارات ص302</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>“Amro bin Al-amd, Hajar bin Uday, Habbah Al-Awfy, Al-Harith Al-A’awar and <strong>Abdullah Ibn Saba’</strong> all entered on the Chief of the Believers (Ali) …” (Al-Gharat 302).</p>
<p>Besides, <strong>the oldest</strong> reference to the term “Sabaite” is Diwan Ashi Hamdan , p. 147. A`sha Hamdan died in 83 H. Imam Tabari died 310 H. i.e. over 120 years after him. He says about Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi (the Kafir Shia saint) and his companions:</p>
<div>شهدت عليكم أنكم سبئية وأني بكم يا شرطة الكفر عارف</div>
<p>“I give testimony that you are<strong> Sabaites</strong>. O soldiers of kufr, I know you very well.”</p>
<p>As for Sayf Ibn Omar having been declared a liar and a weak narrator by Sunni Hadithists themselves, al-islam org says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, later on, I give the sayings of several leading Sunni scholars, who all confirmed that Sayf Ibn Umar was an untrustworthy person and his stories are void….</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is interesting to see that although al-Dhahabi (d. 748 AH) has quoted<br />
from the book of Sayf in his History, he has mentioned in his other book<br />
that Sayf as a weak narrator. In “al-Mughni fi al-Dhu’afa’” al-Dhahabi<br />
wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Sayf has two books which have been unanimously abandoned by the<br />
scholars.” (al-Mughni fi al-Dhu’afa’, by al-Dhahabi, p292)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not that he is a liar some of his narrations in History (hence Al-Dhahabi narrated from him history reports ONLY) are true but he is more of a story-teller as in he narrates the event without regard<strong> to accuracy of words</strong> but in the form of a fun story which is why as a narrator of<strong> Prophetic Hadith</strong> his narrations are rejected by consensus, here are some examples:</p>
<p>&#8211; Al-Nasa’i (d. 303 AH) wrote: “Sayf’s narrations are weak and they should be disregarded because he was unreliable and untrustworthy.”</p>
<p>&#8211; Yahya Ibn Mueen (d. 233 AH) wrote: “Sayf’s narrations are weak and useless.”</p>
<p>&#8211; Abu Hatam (d. 277 AH) wrote: “Sayf’s Hadith is rejected.”</p>
<p>These are just few exampled Shias like Al-’Askari love to quote, yet he hid other crucial sayings of the very same Sunni Hadithists in his books such as:</p>
<p>&#8211; Ibn Abi Hatam (d. 327 AH) wrote: “Scholars have abandoned Sayf’s narrations.” al-Suyuti (d. 900 AH) wrote: “Sayf’s Hadith is weak.” <strong>But when it comes to Historical narrations what he says is taken into consideration</strong> unlike what the Shia claimed.</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-’Asqalani says about him in Taqreeb al-Tahtheeb 1/344: ابن حجر في تقريب التهذيب ( 1/344 ): (عمدة في التاريخ)<strong>“Relied upon in history</strong>.”</p>
<p>Al-Dhahabi says about him in Meezan al-I’itidal 2/255: الذهبي في ميزان الاعتدال (2/255): (كان إخباريا عارفا).”He was<strong> a knowledgeable historian</strong>.”</p>
<p>For this reason the scholars (Very famous Islamic historians such as Muhammad Sobhi Hassan Hallaq, Muhammad ibn Tahir al-Barazanji, Sheikh Yahya Ibrahim al-Yahya, Dr.Khalid al-Ghayb in the university of Umm al-Qura.You can review books such as:</p>
<p>-Istishhad `Uthman wa Waq`at al-Jamal fi Marwiyat Sayf ibn `Umar.</p>
<p>-Sahih wa Da`eef Tareekh al-Tabari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have placed certain rules to accepting any narration from Sayf Ibn Omar:</p>
<p>1- What he says needs to have a Sahih foundation in the books of Hadith(i.e Sahih al-Bukhari) and it has to be taken from the reliable historical sources(i.e Tareekh Al-Tabari).</p>
<p>2- His narrations must not have anything related to ‘Aqeedah and matters of Halal and Haram.</p>
<p>3- His narrations must be free from any attacks on any of the companions.</p>
<p>4- His narration must not be biased towards certain well known political positions during the rightly-guided caliphate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see Al-’Askari and other Shia propagandists play a dirty game by showing the opinion of Hadithists in regards to Sayf Ibn Omar as a narrator of PROPHETIC AHADITH. No doubt, he is an untrustworthy person in regards to that, but as for history (according to Shias and Sunnis) narrations can be easier accepted, especially if there are supportive narrations, and in the case of Sayf Ibn Omar there are more than eight narrations we have provided which were NOT transmitted through Sayf Ibn Omar, so the exuse of him being a liar or being the only one who narrated about Ibn Saba’ and his connection to extremist Shiism (Rafidhism) is the actualy myth.</p>
<blockquote><p>(إن أخبار الفتنة وصلتنا عن طرق أخرىغير طرق سيف بن عمر التيمي، وهذه الروايات بعمومها لا تخالف رواية سيف ، و إنما تؤكد صحتها و تضيف إليها بعض التفاصيل، و إذا كان المؤرخون يأخذون برواية سيف ، فلأنهم وجدوا فيها كشفا لليد الخفية التي كانت وراء تنظيم المعارضة على عثمان .. إلى إن يقول: لهذا لا يمكن إنكار وجود السبئية في أحداث ذكرها قدامى المؤرخين للملل و النحل، و مع وضوح حقيقة وجود السبئية يجب أن لا تخفى عن أعيننا الحقيقة الأخرى ، و هي : أنه لولا وجود المعارضة لما تمكن عبد الله بن سبأ من الوصول إلى أهدافه) (12)</p>

<blockquote><p>Translation:</p>
<p>Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan bin Musa <strong>Al-Naubakhti</strong> (3rd Century Hijrah Shia Scholars, died 310H) on Abdullah bin Saba’</p>
<p>This is a book authored by  <b>Abu Muhammad al-Hasan bin Moosaa al-Naubakhti</b> (d. before 300H). He is a third century Shi’i authorities and wrote on the sects and viewpoints of the Shia. On page 31 of this work (1st edition, 1412, Dar al-Rashaad) we see the following entry (see scan above) within which there occurs:</p>
<p>“And a sect (from amongst them) which said: Ali was not killed and nor did he die, and he will not die until he drives the Arabs forth with his staff and fills the earth with justice and equity just as it had been filled with oppression and tyranny. This was the first sect of this Ummah that spoke of (the position of) al-waqf (withholding) after the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam),<strong> and the first of them that spoke with exaggeration (al-ghuluww)</strong>, and<strong> this sect is called the Sab’iyyah, the associates of Abdullah bin Saba’, and he used to display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othmaan and the Companions and would free himself from them.</strong> And<strong> he said</strong> that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so. Ali took hold of him and asked him about this saying of his and he affirmed it, <strong>so he ordered that he be killed</strong>, but then the people protested, “O Amir al-Mu’mineen! Will you kill a man <strong>who calls to love of the Ahl al-Bayt, to your loyalty and disassociation from your enemies?</strong>” So instead, he exiled him to al-Madaa’in. <strong>A group from the people of knowledge</strong><strong>from the associates of Ali (alayhis-salaam)</strong> judged that Abdullah bin Saba’ was a Jew who then became Muslim and showed loyalty to Ali (alayhis salaam) and whilst he was a Jew he used to say the same of Joshua bin Nun after Moses (alayhis salaam) [as he said about Ali], and in his Islam, he (Ibn Saba’) would say the same of Ali (alayhis salaam) after the death of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), with what is similar to that (what he used to say as a Jew).<strong> He was also the first to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali (alayhis salaam)</strong>, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers. It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, “<strong>The foundation of al-Rafd is taken from the Jews</strong>.” When Abdullah bin Saba and his companions heard the announcement of Ali’s death whilst they were in al-Madaa’in, he said to the one who announced it, “You have lied O enemy of Allaah. Even if you came with Ali’s brain in seventy bundles, and you tasked seventy just men to kill him, we would not believe you due to our knowledge that he has not died and was not killed and that he will not die unti he drives the Arabs forth with his staff and dominates the earth.” From that day, he and his associates travelled until they came to the door (of the house of) Ali. They sought permission to enter from the one entrusted to look after him during his lifetime, hoping that they would reach him. Those who were present from his (Ali’s) family and associates and children said to them, “Glorified by Allaah! Do you know that Amir al-Mu’mineen has been martyred?” They said, “We know that he was not killed and will not die until he drives the Arabs forth with his sword and staff, just as he ruled them with his proof and evidence, and indeed he hears the secret-conversations and he glitters in the darknesses, just as the polished sword-edge.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now this is a clear-cut admission and this quote alone by their classical scholars themselves is enough to debunk all their (vain) efforts i.e. the REAL propaganda, namely that Ibn Saba’ is a myth invented by the Umayyads.</p>

<blockquote><p>Translation:</p>
<p>“<strong>A group from the people of knowledge</strong><strong> </strong>mentioned that Abdullah bin Saba’ was a Jew who then became Muslim and showed loyalty to Ali (alayhis salaam) and whilst he was a Jew he used to say the same of Joshua bin Nun after Moses (alayhis salaam) [as he said about Ali], and in his Islam, he (Ibn Saba’) would say the same of Ali (alayhis salaam) after the death of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), with what is similar to that (what he used to say as a Jew).<strong> He was also the first to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali (alayhis salaam)</strong>, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers. It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, “<strong>The foundation of al-Rafd is taken from the Jews</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us list what Al-Naubakhti and Al-Kashi have stated in a nutshell:</p>
<p>1) <strong> The first sec</strong>t (lead by Ibn Saba’) that<strong> exaggerated (Al-Ghuluww) with the Ahl Al-Bayt/Ali was the Sabaite (</strong><strong>Sab’iyyah) sect. Ali wanted to burn Ibn Saba’ alive for that, but expelled him, nevertheless once the Kufr was repeated by his followers (the Sabaites) he burned them alive (the later i.e. the burning is proven in Sunni and Shia narrations).</strong></p>
<p>2) He was the first to<strong> display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and the Companions and would free himself from them (just as the Rafidha today, the only sect that does so!).</strong> And<strong> he said</strong> that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so (just as the Rafidha today claim). Ali wanted to KILL him for that (!) only due to the protest of the people he expelled him instead (punished him nevertheless).</p>
<p>3) Al-Naubakhti says that ‘<strong>A group from the people of knowledge</strong><strong> from the associates of Ali (alayhis-salaam)</strong> judged that Abdullah bin Saba’ was a Jew who then became Muslim and showed loyalty to Ali (alayhis salaam).’</p>
<p>The last part i.e. number three is essential (we will analyse number one and two later, Insha’Allah) for it is not just an admission that Ibn Saba’ did exist, rathe<strong>r he was the first who propagated the foundations</strong> (obviously not the whole Shia corpus which evolved during centuries) of Tashayyu’ which is <em>Al-Rafdh</em> (rejection the absolute majority of the Sahaba, especially Abu Bakr and Omar) and<em> Al-Ghuluw</em> (exaggeration) with the Ahl Al-Bayt/Ali, two distinctive features that only the Rafidhi sect (in it’s different offshoots such as the Twelvers) holds, until this very day. For now, what is most important to is is the following admission:</p>
<blockquote><p>وحكى جماعة من أهل العلم من أصحاب علي عليه السلام أن عبد الله بن سبأ كان يهوديا</p>
<p>Al-Naubakhti and Al-Kashi say that ‘<strong>A group from the people of knowledge</strong><strong> (from the associates of Ali in Al-Naubakhti’s quote)</strong> judged that Abdullah bin Saba’ was a Jew …</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see – unlike some Rafidhi propagandists claim – the Shia scholars are not quoting Sunni sources or rumours about the Shia, rather they admit that a group <strong>from the people of knowledge from the associates of Ali</strong> (i.e. those who claimed to follow him) themselves admitted that a Ibn Saba’ the Jew existed and stated what we have listed above. We promised you before that it will take less then few minutes to debunk every Rafidhis speech or book when it comes to their desperate denial of the existence of Ibn Saba’.</p>
<p>Know, that the above admission is so explosive that later Rafidha scholars  have resorted to omit the most crucial part of the admission (to make it look as if some nobodies have admitted that Ibn Saba’ existed and not Ahl Al-’Ilm/People of Knowledge and followers of Ali). Here an exampled of their academical fraud to hide the truth about their spiritual forefather, Abu Al-Rafidha Ibn Saba’:</p>

<h2>معجم رجال الحديث – السيد الخوئي – ج 11 – ص 206 – 207</h2>
<p>Book: ‘Mo’jam Rijal Al-Hadeeth by Ayatollah Abul-Qasim Al-Khoie, vol. 11, p. 206-207</p>
<p>The crime of the renowned Shia leader Al-Khoie who tried to hide the truth:</p>
<p><b>وقال الكشي : ” ذكر بعض أن عبد الله بن سبأ كان يهوديا ـ</b></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Al-Khoie quotes Al-Kashi from Al-Sadooq&#8217;s &#8216;Ikhtiyar Ma&#8217;rifah Al-Rija;&#8217;]“<strong>Al-Kash</strong>i said: ‘that <strong>SOME </strong>mentioned that Abdullah bin Saba’ was a Jew …”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the wording he omitted from the original source he quoted:<em>  ”<strong>A group from the people of knowledge</strong><strong>“</strong></em></p>
<p>And this is the wording he replaced the above with: <strong><em>“Some”</em></strong></p>
<p>You see what difference it makes? The later suggests that it is some rumour by some unknown people. The former (the original that Al-Khoie tampered with) says that nobody less than<em><strong> the people of knowledge</strong> </em>confirmed the existence of a personality called Ibn Saba’ the Jew. In fact, they also confirmed that he was the very first who manifested revilement upon Abu Bakr, Omar, Othmaan and the Companions. And he is the first one who spoke of the Imaamah (leadership) of Amir al-Mu’mineen (alayhis salaam), and he is the one who said that Ali is the wasiyy of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa aalihi) (i.e. the one with whom the people were advised as a legacy) and (he claimed) he never said this except out of love for Ahl al-Bayt (exactly as the Rafidha do today), and calling to their allegiance and disavowing from their enemies, and they are the Companions and whoever allied with him upon his claim.</p>
<p>So far we have gathered the admission of two Rafidha scholars: Al-Kashi and Al-Naubakhti and there are lots more, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Al-Maamqaani</strong> (another Shia scholar, the Kafir who admitted that according to the consensus of the Rafidhi sect, all Sahaba apostated except three!) from his work <i>Tanqih al-Maqaal Fi Ilm al-Rijaal</i> (2/183-184):</p>
<blockquote><p>عبد الله بن سبأ الذي رجع إلى الكفر وأظهر الغلو … غال ملعون، حرقه أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام بالنار، وكان يزعم أن علياً إله، وأنه نبي<br />
Abdullah bin Saba’ who returned to kufr (disbelief) and manifested Ehuluww (exaggeration)… Exaggerator, cursed one, Amir al-Mu’mineen burned him with the fire, and he used to claim that Ali is a deity and that he (Abdullah bin Saba’) is a prophet.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sa’ad bin Abdullah al-Ash’ari al-Qummi</strong> who was speaking of the Sab’iyyah (in <i>al-Maqaalaat wal-Firaq</i> p. 20):</p>
<blockquote><p>السبئية أصحاب عبد الله بن سبأ، وهو عبد الله بن وهب الراسبي الهمداني، وساعده على ذلك عبد الله بن خرسي وابن اسود وهما من أجل أصحابه، وكان أول من أظهر الطعن على أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان والصحابة وتبرأ منهم<br />
Al-Sab’iyyah are the associates of Abdullah bin Saba’ and he is Abdullah bin Wahb al-Raasibee al-Hamdaani, and he was supported in that by Abullah bin Khurasi and Ibn Aswad and they are the loftiest of his companions, and the first of what he manifested was revilement upon Abu Bakr, Omar, Othmaan and the Companions and he freed himself from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ni’matullat Al-Jaza’r</strong>i:</p>
<blockquote><p>قال عبد الله بن سبأ لعلي عليه السلام: أنت الإله حقاً، فنفاه علي عليه السلام إلى المدائن، وقيل أنه كان يهودياً فأسلم، وكان في اليهودية يقول في يوشع بن نون وفي موسى مثل ما قال في علي</p>
<p>Abdullah bin Saba’ said to Ali (alayhis salaam), “You are the deity in truth.” So Ali (alayhis-salaam) banished him to Al-Madaa’in, and it is said that he was a Jew who accepted Islam and whilst upon his Judaism he used to say about Joshua bin Noon and about Moses the likes of what he said about Ali.</p>
<p>All the Shiah scholars have given an account of Ibn Saba, his views and beliefs and his party ;<br />
Sayyid Qummi [who died in 301H.], Sheykh Ta’ifah Tusi, Tastri in Qamus al-Rijal, Abbas Qummi in Tuhfat al-Ahbab, Khu Ansari in Raudhat al-Jannat, Sabhani in Nasikh al-Tawarikh and the author of Rawdhat al-Safa, have all mentioned him and his party”.</p></blockquote>
<p>From all of the above, we have corroboration of the existence of the personality of Abdullah bin Saba’ the Jew and the existence of a faction who aided him and pronounced his call and they are known as Al-Sab’iyyah. Some Shia scholars are well aware of that fact, hence they do not reject all the evidence (there are also Sahih narrations by the Imams in Al-Kashi’s ‘Rijal’ cursing Ibn Saba’, did the Imams cursed mythtical figures?!) we have cited. As for those who reject the existence of Ibn Saba’ (such as Yasser Al-Khabith, Al-’Askari, Al-Wa’eli and many other Shia scholars and Shia preachers in the west such as Nakhjavani) then they have no leg to stand on as you can see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">3. Shia Objection: Ibn Saba’ did existed, but Tashayyu’ (Shiism) and the Imamite sect are innocent of him.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for those who do admit that the he existed, then of course they do not admit that Ibn Saba’ laid down the foundation of Tashayyu’ (Shiism), and with foundation we (and Sunni scholars throughout history) certainly do not mean the creed of loving the Ahl Al-Bayt, rather heretical beliefs propagated by the Rafidhi sect.  such as declaring the likes of Abu Bakr and Omar Kuffar, the belief in Raj’ah (return of the Imams before Judgement day), Wilayah Al-Takwiniyyah (Imams having absolute control over the creation/atoms) etc.</p>
<p>hat in regards to this group you have to obviously do more than just to prove the existence of Ibn Saba’.</p>
<p>This group has at least the decency and academical level of not rejecting gospel truths in their own books i.e. the existence of Ibn Saba’ the Jew, yet they will reject <strong>any connection</strong>between Tashayyu’ (Shiism) and Sabaite propagated beliefs. They will refer you to the likes of Muhammad Ibn Al-Hassan Al-Tusi (major Rafidhi Shi’i scholar, died 460H) who cursed Ibn Saba’ himself and made Takfeer (declared him a Kafir) on him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Al-Toosi, Rijaal, pg. 75, person # 718)</p>
<p>TRANSLATION:</p>
<p>“`Abd Allaah bin Saba – returned to kufr (disbelief) and it showed that he was a ghullah (exagerrator)”</p>
<p>These Rawafidh will also refer to the Sahih narrations in Al-Kashi’s ‘Rijal’ where the Imams cursed Ibn Saba’ and based on that they will claim that although Ibn Saba’ existed, he certainly has no connection to the Shia Madhab. According to these apologetics Ibn Saba is a guy who has been cursed, by the Imams, merely because he tried to preach to the people the divinity of Ali, and not the Imamah of Ali.</p>
<p>What these people overlook or try to blur out is the fact that Shia scholars did not only confirm that Ibn Saba’ teached to the people the divinity of Ali, rather<strong> he was also the first to preach two essential basics</strong> which are only to be found in the creed of the Rafidha:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Ibn Saba was the first to display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and the Companions and would free himself from them.</strong> And<strong> he said</strong> that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so (just as the Rafidha today claim). Ali wanted to KILL him for that (!) only due to the protests of the people he expelled him instead i.e.(punished him nevertheless). This has been confirmed by Al-Naubakhti, Al-Kashi and (Saad Ibn Abdallah) Al-Qummi.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Ibn Saba’ was also the first to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali</strong>, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers (Takfeer Al-Sahaba). This is another admission by Shia scholars (not ‘Umayyads’) that cannot be dismissed that easily.</p>
<p>It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, “<strong>The foundation of Al-Rafd is taken from the Jews</strong>.” and this is what the Muslims believe and the Ahl Al-Sunnah declare and within this precise slogan lies the answer to the sheer stupidty of Rafidhi propagators who ask questions such as:</p>
<p><em>“What  Shia Usool can be traced back to Ibn Saba’?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What Fiqh ruling?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Which of our Imams praised Ibn Saba’”</em></p>
<p><em>“How many Ahadith did we take from Ibn Saba’”</em></p>
<p><em>“Are the Shia so stupid and ignorant that after 1400 years, they</em><br />
<em>have never figured out that their belief and faith are based on fabricated</em><br />
<em>traditions and tales going back to Abdullah Ibn Saba?”</em></p>
<p><em>“If Abdullah Ibn Saba is such an influential and important figure for the</em><br />
<em>Shia, how come they NEVER quote him like they do with the Imams of Ahlul</em><br />
<em>Bayt? Surely, if Abdullah Ibn Saba was their Master Teacher, they must</em><br />
<em>quote him and be proud to do so?”</em></p>
<p>These questioned are seriously being asked by the likes of Al-’Askari, Allahyari (a Rabid Rafidhi pracher), Yasser Al-Khabeeth, Ammar Nakhjavani, Al-Wa’eli etc. and the answer is simple:</p>
<p>Nobody, not a single Muslim-Sunnah scholar throughout history has ever claimed that Ibn Saba’ was the ‘Marja’-e-Taqlid’ of the Rafidha in the sense of them realising that they are in fact following his Jewish ideas. Heck, the Christ-Worshippers to this very day don’t realise or won’t accept the founder of their sect was Saulus the pagan and not Jesus (peace be upon him), they really think they are Shias (followers/believers in) of Jesus. So what is meant by ‘Shiism was created by a Jew’ is that Shiism (not in the political sense, for many Sahaba where followers of Ali but certainly not Rafidha in creed) as a creed, particularly in regards to the Takfeer of the Sahaba (especially Shaykhayn i.e. Abu Bakr and Omar) and the claim of the obligation of the leadership (Imamat) of Ali (and the Ghuluw with him) is not the Madhab of the Ahl Al-Bayt, rather the Madhab of Ibn Saba’ the Jew who laid down these very foundations, he was the first  to propagate those beliefs, hence it has been said and will be always said that:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ibn Saba’ is the spiritual father of the Rafidha, for he laid down foundations that can be found in no sect, except the Rafidhi sect (in his many offshoots such as the Twelvers today).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many of those that have said that he is the created of Shiasm are referring to his views on Takfeer of the Sahaba, R<em>aja’ah </em>and his G<em>huluw (extremism) </em>for Ali, and that he was famous for holding these views. Perhaps to the extent that one would have a hard time finding someone who shared such views before him.However, if one is going to argue that Ibn Saba’a literally “created” Shiasm with all its foundations including Imamah and what not, then no, there is no such thing and nobody made that claim amongst the scholars, the whole point is that Ibn Saba’ laid down the foundations of Rafidhism which had been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt, to this very day by the Twelver sects (foundations such as Takfeer of the Sahaba, Abu Bakr and Omar etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Muslim scholars actually believe that his ideas are responsible<strong> for the evolution of Shiism</strong>, but not that he was Shiism actual founder (for Rafidi Shi’ism changed during centuries). You will find in Tareekh Dimashq a few more reports on Ibn Saba’ glorifying Ali and referring to him as a creator. Al-Jawzajani (d. 259 AH) in his book of <em>rijal</em> also refers to Ibn Saba’ and states that he said that we only have 1/9 of the Qur’an, and the rest is with Ali… and over time, that perhaps turned into the view of T<em>ahreef</em>. The bottom line is we do see some of what Ibn Saba’ propagate in the name of the Ahl Al-Bayt come in the same form under what we know today as Shiism and is been proagated by Shiism in the name of the Ahl Al-Bayt.</span></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imami Shia write arguments to prove the Imamah of `Ali (ra) but they also write in defense of the theory of Imamah and try to push away all objections. What you will see in this thread is but one of many contradictions between what they write to prove it and what they write to defend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800000;">THE FIRST TRUTH:</span> ALLAH GUARANTEES THE SAFETY OF THE PROPHET (SAWS) IF HE ANNOUNCES IMAMAH.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imami Shia scholars have spoken of this matter during their talk on the event of Ghadeer. In brief, Allah ordered the Prophet (SAWS) to deliver the news of the Imamah of `Ali (ra) to the Muslims, but he (SAWS) was reluctant and afraid, he feared that they would harm him and they would reject the religion. The Prophet (SAWS) did not announce this matter until Allah promised him safety from the people and protection of their harm as stated in authentic Shia narrations which interpret the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.} [al-Ma&#8217;idah:67]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We conclude from this point, that the Imami Shia scholars believe that Allah told his Prophet (SAWS) to announce the Imamah of `Ali (ra) loudly, in front of all Muslims and that he would prevent the hypocrites and conspirators from harming him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800000;">THE SECOND TRUTH:</span> ALLAH DOES NOT GUARANTEES THE SAFETY OF THE QUR&#8217;AN IF IT ANNOUNCES IMAMAH.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imami scholars have stated many times that Allah intentionally kept the matter of Imamah unclear in his holy book, so that the enemies of Islam would not be enraged and as a result they would tamper with the Qur&#8217;anic text and corrupt it, in order to get rid of the Imamah which prevents them from assuming seats of power and authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The first case: Making Imamah unclear by not mentioning the name of the Imam explicitly.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حعفر مرتضى العاملي في كتابه (الصحيح من سيرة النبي الأعظم ( ص ) ) ( 32 / 21 ) :[ ولعله لأجل ذلك لم يذكر اسم الإمام علي &#8221; عليه السلام &#8221; في القرآن . . حفظاً للقرآن من أن يحرفه من هو أشر وأضر ممن رمى القرآن بالنبل وهو يقول : تهددني بجبار عنيد * فها أنا ذاك جبار عنيد إذا ما جئت ربك يوم حشر * فقل : يا رب مزقني الوليد نعم ، إنه من أجل ذلك وسواه لم يذكر اسم الإمام علي &#8221; عليه السلام &#8221; في القرآن بصراحة ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-`Allamah al-Muhaqqiq Ja`far Murtada al-`Amili says in his book &#8220;al-Sahih min Seerat al-Nabi al-A`zam&#8221; 32/21:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Maybe it&#8217;s because of this that the name of Imam `Ali (as) was not explicitly mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an (…) to safeguard the Qur&#8217;an from being corrupted by ones who are worse than he who shot it with an arrow while saying:</strong><br />
<strong>((Are you threatening me with &#8216;obstinate tyrant&#8217;? * I am the obstinate tyrant! * On the Day of Judgment, tell Allah: &#8216;al-Waleed tore me up&#8217;.))</strong><br />
<strong>It was because of this and other matters that the name of `Ali (as) was not explicitly mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To explain what was being said, he was referring to al-Waleed bin Yazid bin `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan, and it is said that this man opened the Qur&#8217;an once and read the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{ And they requested victory from Allah, and disappointed, [therefore], was every obstinate tyrant.} [Ibrahim:15]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he did not like this verse, he then placed the Qur&#8217;an somewhere and shot it with an arrow while saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">تهددني بجبار عنيد فها أنا ذاك جبار عنيد</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إذا ما جئت ربك يوم حشر فقل يا رب مزقني الوليد</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">((Are you threatening me with &#8216;obstinate tyrant&#8217;? * I am the obstinate tyrant! * On the Day of Judgment, tell Allah: &#8216;al-Waleed tore me up&#8217;.))</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief al-`Amili is saying that if Allah mentioned the name of `Ali (ra) clearly then those who are even worse than al-Waleed would have corrupted and destroyed the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الخميني في كتابه ( كشف الأسرار ) ص131: [ لو كانت مسألة الإمامة قد تم تثبيتها في القرآن ، فإن أولئك الذين لا يعنون بالإسلام والقرآن إلا لأغراض الدنيا والرئاسة كانوا يتخذون من القرآن وسيلة لتنفيذ أغراضهم المشبوهة ، ويحذفون تلك الآيات من صفحاته ، ويسقطون القرآن من أنظار العالمين إلى الأبد، ويلصقون العار &#8211; وإلى الأبد- بالمسلمين والقرآن ، ويثبتون على القرآن ذلك العيب الذي يأخذه المسلمون على كتب اليهود والنصارى ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia grand Ayatullah Imam al-Khomeini says in &#8220;Kashf al-Asrar&#8221; pg131:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[If the matter of Imamah was established in the Qur&#8217;an, then those who only seek worldly things such as leadership through Islam and the Qur&#8217;an would have taken the book as a means to achieve their goals, they would erase such verses from its pages, and remove the Qur&#8217;an from the sight of the people forever, and they would attach eternal disgrace to the Muslims and the Qur&#8217;an, they would mistreat the Qur&#8217;an as the Muslims say the Jews and Christians mistreated their books.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">مصطفى الخميني في كتابه ( تفسير القرآن الكريم ) ( 2 / 331-332 ) :[ وحيث اقتضت السياسة الإسلامية والتقية الإلهية كتمان أمر الولي المطلق بالاسم الصريح في الكتاب الإلهي ، حتى يكمل الكتاب التدويني بالتطابق مع الكتاب التكويني ، ويعلم الأصل الثالث لكافة أبناء الهداية وأفراد البشر ، فكأنه تكفل ببيانه وتوضيحه على الوجه الآخر الأحسن ، رعاية لجميع الجهات والجوانب ، ومحافظة على أصل الإسلام من أعدائه ، وصيانة للكتاب الإلهي عن الانحراف والتحريف والتوهين والتكذيب ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Mustafa al-Khomeini says in his book &#8220;Tafseer al-Qur&#8217;an al-Kareem&#8221; 2/331-332:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Islamic politics and Godly Taqiyyah have decreed that the name of the absolute ruler not be mentioned explicitly in the Godly book (…) it is as if he took responsibility of clarifying it through other, better means, out of care for all sides of this matter, and to protect the foundation of Islam from its enemies, and to maintain the Godly book from being corrupted and falsified.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">علي السيستاني ص 143 :[ 536 . السؤال : ما الحكمة من عدم ذكر اسم الإمام علي في القرآن الكريم ؟</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الجواب : يمكن أن تكون الحكمة فيه أن الضغائن التي أوجبت الصاق تهمة الهجر والهذيان بالرسول الأكرم صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم &#8211; والعياذ بالله &#8211; لم يبعد أن توجب التشكيك في صحة ما أنزل من القرآن في علي &#8211; عليه السلام &#8211; لو كان تصريح باسمه الشريف فتكون النتيجة أسوأ مما هو عليه الآن من الضلال العام ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Grand Ayatullah Sayyed `Ali al-Sistani says in his book of &#8220;Istifta&#8217;at&#8221; pg143:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Question #536: What is the wisdom behind not mentioning the name of Imam `Ali in the holy Qur&#8217;an?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Answer: It could be that the grudges that caused some to accuse the Prophet (SAWS) of hallucinating and of being delirious -I seek refuge in Allah- these grudges could also cause someone to cast doubts on what was revealed in the Qur&#8217;an concerning `Ali (as), if his noble name was explicitly mentioned then the result would be even worse [for that person] from just general misguidance.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We clearly see the Shia scholars accusing the first three Caliphs (ra) of attempting to distort the book of Allah if it had the name of `Ali (ra), out of hatred for him and thirst for power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah save us from the evil devilish thoughts of the Shia scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The second case: Making Imamah unclear by including it between other verses to make the context vague.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholars claim that the verses proving the Wilayah of `Ali (ra) have been placed by Allah in the middle of other verses with completely different context so that people wouldn&#8217;t distort them, such as the verse of `Ali giving the ring while in Ruku` which is included between verses talking about being loyal and supportive of believers and not being friendly with Jews and Christians, or the verse of purity and the event of the cloak being placed between verses talking about the mothers of believers and so on…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below the Shia scholar and Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarim al-Shirazi talks about the verse of completion of religion and how it<br />
was placed in the middle of general verses talking about rulings of Halal and Haraam concerning meat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ناصر مكارم الشيرازي في تفسيره ( الأمثل في تفسير كتاب الله المنزل ) ( 3 / 602 ) :[ ثانيا : هناك احتمال بأن يكون سبب حشر موضوع واقعة &#8221; غدير خم &#8221; في آية تشمل على موضوع لا صلة لها به مطلقا ، مثل موضوع أحكام الحلال والحرام من اللحوم ، إنما هو لصيانة الموضوع الأول من أن تصل إليه يد التحريف أو الحذف أو التغيير .. وهي تدل بوضوح على الحساسية المفرطة التي كانت لدى نفر من الناس تجاه قضية الخلافة بعد النبي ( صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم ) حيث لم يتركوا وسيلة إلا استخدموها لإنكار هذا الامر . فلا يستبعد &#8211; والحالة هذه &#8211; أن تتخذ اجراءات وقائية لحماية الأدلة والوثائق الخاصة بالخلافة من أجل إيصالها إلى الأجيال المتعاقبة دون أن تمسها يد التحريف أو الحذف ، ومن هذه الإجراءات حشر موضوع الخلافة &#8211; المهم جدا &#8211; في القرآن بين آيات الأحكام الشرعية الفرعية لإبعاد عيون وأيدي المعارضين والعابثين عنها ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarim al-Shirazi says in &#8220;al-Amthal fi Tafseer Kitab Allah&#8221; 3/602:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Secondly: it is possible that the topic of the event of &#8220;Ghadeer Khum&#8221; was pushed into a verse that talks about a completely unrelated matter, such as the rulings of Halal and Haraam meat. It is only to guard the first topic from the hands of corruption and deletion (…) it clearly shows the sensitivity that a group of people had towards the successorship after the Prophet (SAWS), where they didn&#8217;t leave any method unless they used it to disprove this matter. So it is not far -and it is the case- that there would be preventive methods to preserve the proofs and documents pertaining to Khilafah so it could reach the later generations without Tahreef(corruption). From these methods is to push the matter of Khilafah -which is very important- in the Qur&#8217;an between the verses of general rulings to lead the eyes of the opposition away from it.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">علي الميلاني ينقل تصريح آيتهم العظمى عبد الحسين شرف الدين في كتابه ( نفحات الأزهار ) ( 20 / 67 ):[ والسيد شرف الدين العاملي ذهب إلى أن النكتة هي أنه لو جاءت الآية بلفظ المفرد ، فإن شانئي علي وأهل البيت وسائر المنافقين لا يطيقون أن يسمعوها كذلك ، وإذ لا يمكنهم حينئذ التمويه والتضليل ، فيؤدي ذلك إلى التلاعب بألفاظ القرآن وتحريف كلماته أو نحو ذلك مما يخشى عواقبه على الإسلام ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Ayatullah `Ali al-Milani reports the statement of their grand Ayatullah `Abdul-Hussein Sharaf-ul-Deen in his book &#8220;Nafahat al-Azhar&#8221; 20/67:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[al-Sayyed Sharaf-ul-Deen al-`Amili had the opinion that if the verse [verse of Wilayah] came in the singular form, then the haters of `Ali and Ahlul-Bayt and the rest of the hypocrites wouldn&#8217;t tolerate to hear it as such, that way they couldn&#8217;t hide the truth and misguide the people, so it would lead them to corrupt the text of the Qur&#8217;an or the like, the consequences of this would be fearsome for Islam]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He means the verse in which the Shia claim that `Ali (ra) gave Zakat while bowing down, it should have been in the singular form because `Ali (ra) is just one man but Allah placed it in the plural form out of fear (I seek refuge in Allah) that the haters of `Ali (ra),<br />
might corrupt it and change it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">آيتهم العظمى جعفر السبحاني قال في كتابه ( مفاهيم القرآن ) ( 10 / 171 ):[ ولكن يبقى هنا سؤال آخر ، وهو أنه إذا كانت الآية ، آية مستقلة فلماذا جاءت في المصحف جزءا من آية أخرى ، ولم تكتب بصورة آية تامة في جنب الآيات الأخرى ؟<br />
الجواب : التاريخ يطلعنا بصفحات طويلة على موقف قريش وغيرهم من أهل البيت عليهم السلام ، فإن مرجل الحسد ما زال يغلي والاتجاهات السلبية ضدهم كانت كالشمس في رابعة النهار ، فاقتضت الحكمة الإلهية أن تجعل الآية في ثنايا الآيات المتعلقة بنساء النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم من أجل تخفيف الحساسية ضد أهل البيت ، وإن كانت الحقيقة لا تخفى على من نظر إليها بعين صحيحة ، وأن الآية تهدف إلى جماعة أخرى غير نساء النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم كما بيناه قبل قليل ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their grand Ayatullah Ja`far al-Subhani said in his book &#8220;Mafaheem al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; 10/171:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Here remains one question, if the verse [of <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2013/05/03/ayat-al-tatheer/" rel="external nofollow">purification</a>] was a single independent verse, then why did it  reach us in the Qur&#8217;an as a part of another verse? and it wasn&#8217;t written as an independent verse next to the others?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Answer: History within its pages informs us of the position that the Quraysh and others had towards Ahlul-Bayt (as), there was great jealousy and the negativity towards them was as clear as day light. The Godly wisdom decreed that the verse be placed in the middle of the verses of the Prophet&#8217;s (SAWS) wives, so that the tension against Ahlul-Bayt can be reduced, although the truth cannot be hidden for anyone who looks at it with correct vision, that the verse is meant for another group, other than the wives as we previously clarified.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عالمهم محسن الخزازي عن فيلسوفهم مرتضى المطهري وذلك في كتابه ( بداية المعارف الإلهية في شرح عقائد الإمامية ) ( 2 / 72-73 ):[ وأما لما أشار إليه البعض الآخر كالأستاذ الشهيد المطهري &#8211; قدس سره &#8211; من أنها نزلت في حق الخمسة الطاهرة ، ولكن وضعت بين الآيات المذكورة ، لمصلحة حفظ الإسلام عن تبليغات سوء المنافقين وتمردهم وإعراضهم ، لان النبي &#8211; صلى الله عليه وآله &#8211; كان خائفا من التمرد الصريح عن الإسلام والقرآن الكريم ، لا من أن يذهبوا إلى التأويل مع قيام القرينة الداخلية والخارجية على المعنى المراد فجعلت الآية المذكورة وأشباهها كآية إكمال الدين في ضمن الآيات الأخر ، لأن يتمكن المخالف من التأويل ، ولا يضطر إلى الإعراض الصريح ، والتمرد الواضح ، فالجملة حينئذ تكون معترضة بين الآيات الأخرى كما لا يخفى ].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhsin al-Khizari reports the statement of their philosopher Murtada al-Mutahhari in his book &#8220;Bidayat al-Ma`arif al-Ilahiyyah fi Sharh `Aqaed al-Imamiyyah&#8221; 2/72-73:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[As for what others pointed out such as the teacher and martyr al-Mutahhari may Allah sanctify his secret that it was revealed regarding the five pure ones, but was placed between the mentioned verses for the benefit of preserving Islam from the hypocrites and their mutiny and rejection, because the Prophet (SAWS) was afraid from a clear rebellion against Islam and the Qur&#8217;an, he wasn&#8217;t afraid that they&#8217;d just go for false interpretation although the proofs for the intended meaning are available from inside and outside the [Qur&#8217;anic] text, and other similar verses such as that of the completion of religion between other verses, it is so that the opposition can give their interpretation without necessarily rejecting the explicit text, and doing a clear rebellion]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also good to note that other Shia scholars such as al-Majlisi and al-Milani have a slightly different belief, that the verses were arranged by the companions themselves and they have intentionally placed the aforementioned verses in strange irrelevant locations to misguide the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enough of the blasphemy of the Shia scholars, what we have shown is enough for the intelligent reader to reach a conclusion, after observing the following facts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>First Shia declaration:</strong></span><br />
<strong>Allah almighty tells the Prophet (SAWS): Announce the Wilayah explicitly and loudly and I guarantee your safety from the evil hands of the hypocrites and conspirators.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Second Shia declaration:</strong></span><br />
<strong>Allah almighty tells the holy Qur&#8217;an: Beware! never announce the Wilayah explicitly and loudly because I shall not guarantee your safety from the evil hands of the hypocrites and conspirators.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I leave the conclusion to the intelligent reader and those Shia with a shred of dignity and &#8220;`Aql&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a topic for those who have a very good idea about how the Shia function, and they usually function in two groups both having the same goal but the second group is much more dangerous, meaning the likes of Khomeini who has the most evil of beliefs and intentions in his heart but outwardly talks about &#8220;Unity&#8221; and &#8220;Love&#8221; between Twelver Shia and Muslims. Sometimes however this &#8220;beautiful mask&#8221; that hides the vile truth of the Shia is exposed by none other than the Shia scholars themselves, and as you know Shiism in its true form can never spread among the Muslims or the non-Muslims and this is one of the main reasons for hiding it. A Shia has to deceive in order to get under people&#8217;s skin, in order to earn their trust and loyalty, then he starts spewing his poison.</p>
<p>The Almighty says in his glorious book:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>{ [Allah praises] those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant. } </strong></span>[al-Ahzab : 39]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia Imams usually act like they never read the above verse, this is why we find narrations of lies and Taqiyyah constantly attributed to them and by God they are Innocent from this accusation, but this religion has chosen to take the path of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some Shia scholars as you will see in the following example are too shy to disclose the &#8220;message of Allah&#8221; and would rather keep it hidden, this is because the &#8220;message of Allah&#8221; according to their religion is to curse and slander against Abu Bakr (ra) and `Umar (ra) and all of their lovers. Shia scholar and Muhaddith Yusuf al-Bahrani was commenting on what the other Shia scholar and Muhaddith Ni`matullah al-Jazaeri wrote in his book concerning the great Shia Safavid  (Safawi) scholar `Ali bin al-Hussein al-Karaki, He(al-Bahrani) wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quote</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: right;">قال مولانا السيد نعمة الله الجزائري في صدر كتابه شرح غوالي الئالي &#8230; وكان رحمه الله لا يركب ولا يمضي إلا والباب يمشي في ركابه مجاهراً بلعن الشيخين ومن على طريقتهما</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Mawlana al-Sayyed Ni`matullah al-Jazaeri wrote at the beginning of his book Sharh Ghawali al-Laalee &#8230; And He (al-Karaki) may Allah have mercy on him never used to ride his horse or walk the streets <strong>unless he had his servant walking  in front of him cursing the two sheikhs</strong> (Abu Bakr &amp; `Umar) <strong>and cursing those who follow their way</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here we see what the situation was when the Shia were in a position of power and when they had a strong state, al-Karaki used to have people walking with him for the sole purpose of cursing the companions, this is how deep the hatred runs. So al-Bahrani criticizes al-Jazaeri for uncovering the truth of their great scholar because it caused harm to many of the Shia living in Islamic countries, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quote</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: right;">أقول: إن ما نقله عن الشيخ المزبور من ترك التقية والمجاهرة بسب الشيخين خلاف ما استفاضت به الأخبار عن الأئمة الأخيار الأبرار عليهم السلام ، وهي غفلة من شيخنا المشار إليه إن ثبت النقل المذكور ، وقد نقل السيد المذكور أن علماء الشيعة في مكة المشرفة كتبوا إلى علماء أصفهان من أهل المحاريب والمنابر : أنكم تسبون أئمتهم في أصفهان ونحن في الحرمين نُعذَّب بذلك اللعن والسب ، انتهى ، وهو كذلك</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I say: What he related to us from the sheikh about <strong>leaving Taqiyyah and publicly cursing the two Sheikhs as opposed to what is found in  the countless narrations</strong> from the pious Imams (as), this is a mistake from our sheikh if it is proven to be true, and the Sayyed also mentioned that the Shia scholars in Mecca wrote to the Shia scholars of Isfahan saying: { <strong>You curse and insult their Imams in Isfahan and we in Mecca and Madinah have to face their wrath.</strong> } And this is true.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">source: Lulu al-Bahrain page 153 by Yusuf al-Bahrani.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since most of the Shia narrations that curse the first three caliphs never do this by stating their name, they instead refer to them as &#8220;The first and the second&#8221; or &#8220;Fulan and Fulan&#8221; where the word &#8220;Fulan&#8221; &#8220;<strong>فلان</strong>&#8220;, in Arabic it is like saying &#8220;so-and-so&#8221;, for Taqiyyah purposes usually their names aren&#8217;t mentioned publicly BUT anyone who is familiar with the Shia religion even the Shia laymen know exactly who is being talked about , I shall provide a sample of this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Iranian grand Shia scholar Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi who lived in the Persian Safavid state would discard Taqiyyah and state the obvious as to who &#8220;the first and the second&#8221; are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Qummi wrote in his Tafseer 2/106: from al-Hassan bin &#8216;Ali from Salih bin Sa&#8217;ad: I heard abu &#8216;Abdullah (as) explain the saying of Allah: Surat al-Nur verse 40: {Or (they are) like Darknesses} <strong>means Fulan and Fulan</strong>, {within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves}<strong> meaning Na`thal</strong>, {upon which are waves} meaning Talha and Zubair, {over which are clouds &#8211; darknesses, some of them upon others} Mu&#8217;awiyah and Yazid and the Fitnah of bani Umayyah, {When one puts out his hand} in the Darkness of their Fitnah, { he can hardly see it. And he to whom Allah has not granted light &#8211; for him there is no light.} meaning an Imam from the children of Fatima (as), he doesn&#8217;t have the light of an Imam which will guide him on the day of judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi commented on the above narration by his predecessor in Bihar al-Anwar 32/306: What is meant by &#8220;Fulan and Fulan&#8221; <strong>are Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, and &#8220;Na`thal&#8221; is &#8216;Uthman</strong> , his enemies used to call him Na&#8217;athal likening him to a sheikh with long beard in Egypt who used to be an idiot, it also means a male Hyena .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Kulayni narrated in al-Kafi 8/334: Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Qummi from his uncle &#8216;Abdullah bin al-Salt from Yunus bin &#8216;Abdul-Rahman from &#8216;Abdullah bin SInan from Hussein al-Jammal from abu &#8216;Abdulah (as) regardin the saying of Allah: Surat Fussilat verse 29: {Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men [so] we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest} He (as) said: <strong>It is They</strong>, then He (as) said: <strong>and Fulan was a devil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Majlisi said in his Bihar al-Anwar 30/270:  What is meant by<strong> &#8220;Fulan&#8221; is &#8216;Umar</strong> . . meaning the Jinn mentioned in the verse is &#8216;Umar, he used it as reference for him because he was a devil, either because he came from the devil as <strong>he was the son of an act of adultery</strong>, or because he was a trickster and a deceiver like the devil, and<strong> it is possible that &#8220;Fulan&#8221; here means Abu Bakr</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the Shia scholars did not like their beliefs to be exposed in this way, Grand Ayatulla Muhammad Asif al-Muhsini criticized al-Majlisi for this, because according to him declaring their names would only harm the cause of the Shia and would make the Muslims hate them, al-Muhsini said in Mashara&#8217;at Bihar al-Anwar 1/167:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quote</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: right;">لم يمسك المؤلف رحمه الله قلمه عن السب ، والتفسيق ، والتكفير ، والطعن في جملة من أجزاء بحاره بالنسبة إلى قادة المخالفين ، والله يعلم أنها كم أضرَّت بالطائفة نفساً وعرضاً ومالاً ، على أنه هو الذي نقل الروايات الدالة على وجوب التقية وحرمة إفشاء الأسرار ، وأصرَّ على التصريح بمرجع ضمائر التثنية في الروايات مع أن عوام المؤمنين يعرفونه فضلاً عن خواصهم فأي فائدة في هذا التفسير سوى إشعال نار الغضب والغيض والانتقام ؟ ولا أظنه قادراً على بيان جواب معقول على سلوكه هذا</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The author (al-Majlisi) did not restrain his pen from cursing and insulting and making Takfeer and Tafseeq in his book of Bihar on the leaders of those who oppose us (sunnies), and Allah knows how much this harmed the sect in many ways, it was he who reported the narrations that state that <strong>we must hold on to Taqiyyah and that it is forbidden to reveal the secrets</strong>, but he insisted on declaring what those pronouns were referring to in the narrations, although<strong> the laymen from the believers </strong>(shia) <strong>know their meaning and so do the scholars</strong>, so what benefit can we draw from such explanations other than igniting the flames of anger and revenge? I don&#8217;t believe he has a legitimate excuse for what he did.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; end &#8211;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ja`far al-Sadiq (rah) in the books of Ahlul-Sunnah is a brave honorable Imam from Ahlul-Bayt, Unlike the Shia version. Here is a narration from &#8220;Hilayt-ul-Awliya&#8217; wa Tabaqat al-Asfiya'&#8221; by al-Imam al-Hafiz abu Na`eem (rah):</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>حدثنا محمد بن عمر بن سلم ، ثنا الحسين بن عصمة ، ثنا أحمد بن عمرو بن المقدام الرازي ، قال : وقع الذباب على المنصور فذبه عنه ، فعاد فذبه حتى أضجره ، فدخل جعفر بن محمد عليه ، فقال له المنصور : يا أبا عبد الله لم خلق الله الذباب ؟ قال : ليذل به الجبابرة .</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>[Muhammad bin `Umar bin Salam told us, al-Hussayn ibn `Ismah told us, Ahmad bin `Amro bin al-Miqdam al-Razi said:</strong> <strong>Flies were on the Khalifah al-Mansour, so he started to wave them away until he became bored.</strong><br />
<strong>Then Ja`far bin Muhammad (al-Sadiq) entered on him, so al-Mansour asked  him: &#8220;O aba `Abdillah, why did Allah create flies?&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong>Ja`far replied: &#8220;To disgrace the tyrants.&#8221;]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how then can they make Ja`far (rah) appear like a coward who sticks to Taqiyyah and praises the rulers to be on their good side?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Preface:<br />
</strong><br />
In the name of God the merciful and gracious,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researchers of Islamic sects in our days and those interested in researching the Shia sects in specific will observe the positive image some of these sects try to paint for themselves, the Twelver Shia sect  is no different and the image they try to sell in the west is that of a truthful loving sect that works hard towards Islamic unity. When we take a closer look at the position of the Shia concerning the congregational prayer alongside the rest of the Muslims, we find that the early and late Shia scholars present some pretty descent material, discussing the brotherhood between Muslims and bridging the gaps and uniting the nation, they say that their Imams ordered them to pray together in congregation with the rest of the Muslims in the &#8220;Sunni&#8221; mosques, they will say that the Shia who prays next to the Sunni in a Sunni mosque will be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia scholars have adopted this attitude  and they openly declare it permissible for their followers to pray in congregation with the Muslims and this is indeed a positive step that they think will lessen or reduce the amount of attacks and accusations they usually receive such as them being labeled Takfeeris that make Takfeer on all non-Twelvers, or the accusation of them being hypocrites who only display a peaceful image on the outside but on the inside they hide ill-will and hatred towards all those who differ with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to know the truth of the matter I have resolved to conduct this study, based on what the Shia scholars say in their books and on the narrations they transmitted from their Imams. The result of this study will show whether this beautiful image the Shia displayed to the rest of the Muslims is true and they should be praised for it, or a fake negative image they use only to hide their hatred for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction:<br />
</strong><br />
Before we begin to uncover the truth of their call we need to clarify certain terms often used by Shia scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The first term:</strong> &#8220;al-Mukhalif&#8221; or &#8220;المخالف&#8221;which I translated to: &#8220;The one who opposes&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The meaning of the word &#8220;Mukhalif&#8221; or in plural &#8220;Mukhalifeen&#8221; is basically all those Muslims who oppose or differ with the Twelver Shia, this terms is used by the Shia scholars to refer to Ahlul-Sunnah in all their schools and Madhabs, and then to other Shia such as the Zaidis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed al-Hakeem who currently resides in Najaf said in &#8220;Usool al-Fiqh&#8221; 6/194, while explaining the terms &#8220;Moukhalifeen&#8221; and &#8220;&#8216;Amah&#8221; (العامة):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is apparent that what is meant by al-&#8216;Amah are the Mokhalifoun in all their different teams who are loyal to the two sheikhs(Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar) and see their Caliphate as legitimate; because this is the meaning designated by these terms in the texts]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see above, the Shia scholar explained two terms often used by the Shia to refer to Sunnies, the first one is al-&#8216;Amah or in other words the mainstream Muslims, he said they are the same as the Mukhalifeen who are defined as all Muslims who are loyal to Abu Bakr (ra) and &#8216;Umar (ra) and see their caliphate as legitimate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Reda al-Kalbaykani answered a questioner who asked about the definition of &#8220;al-Mukhalif&#8221; in his book &#8220;Irshad al-Sael&#8221; pg.199, Question #742:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Who is al-Mukhalif? is he the one who opposes with the Shia in their belief in Imamah? or the one who differed with some of the Imams or rejected some such as the Zaidis and others? is the ruling of the Moukhalif the same as the ruling of the Nasibi or Khariji or the Ghulat?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Answer: Bismillah,<br />
al-Moukhalif in our tongue is directed towards those who deny the Caliphate of Ameer al-Mumineen (as), as for the one who denies one of the Imams, although he is considered a Shia yet he is not treated according to the laws of the Twelver Shia.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Allamah Zain al-Deen al-&#8216;Amili whom they call al-Shaheed al-Thani says in &#8220;al-Rawdah al-Bahiyah fi Sharh al-Lama&#8217;ah a-Dimashqiyah&#8221; 1/428:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[al-Moukhalif is any Muslim who is not a Twelver.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The second term:</strong> &#8220;al-Mumin&#8221; or &#8220;المؤمن&#8221; which means &#8220;The believer&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia scholars use the term &#8220;Believer&#8221; to refer to the Twelver Shia exclusively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar al-Khawansari says in &#8220;Jami&#8217;i al-Madarik&#8221; 6/4:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From the conditions of Iman(being a believer) is that he is a Twelver.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassim al-Khoei says in &#8220;Misbah al-Fuqaha&#8221; 1/503-504:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: What is meant by the believer is the one who believes in Allah and his Prophet and the Day of Judgment and the Twelve Imams (as), starting with &#8216;Ali (as) and ending with al-Qaem al-Hujjah al-Muntazar(Mahdi).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah and creator of the republic of Iran, Imam al-Khomeini says in &#8220;al-Makasib al-Muharramah&#8221; 1/250:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is meant by believer: The Imami Twelver Shia.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah &#8216;Ali al-Sistani says in &#8220;al-Masael al-Muntakhabah&#8221; pg.13:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Fourthly: al-Iman(The belief) &#8211; meaning he has to be a Twelver]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, sheikh Muhammad Jawa Mughniyah explains in &#8220;al-Shia fil-Meezan&#8221; pg.118:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And in this occasion we point that when the Imamis(Shia) say in their books of Fiqh: &#8220;Zakat is given to the Mumin(Believer)&#8221; or &#8220;You must pray behind the Mumin(Believer)&#8221; what is meant is the Twelver Imami exclusively.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To sum it up:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; al-Mukhalifoun = those who oppose or differ with the Twelver Shia = mainly Ahlul-Sunnah and some non-Twelver Shia sects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; al-&#8216;Amah = the mainstream Muslims = Ahlul-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8211; al-Muminoun = the believers = Twelver Imami Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we have explained what the Shia scholars mean by &#8220;Those who oppose us&#8221; and &#8220;mainstream Muslims&#8221; and by &#8220;The believers&#8221;, we can start presenting what is apparent and what is hidden from their call to congregational prayer or Jama&#8217;ah prayer with Ahlul-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The beautiful face of their call<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We start with some of their narrations that encourage the Shia to pray in Sunni mosques:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Thiqatul-Islam al-Kulayni narrate in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; 3/380, from al-Halabi, from abu &#8216;Abdullah (as): &#8220;He who prays with them(Sunnies) in the first row is like he who prays behind Rassul-Allah (SAWS).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Sheikh al-Taefa Muhammad bin al-Hassan al-Tusi narrates in &#8220;Tahtheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; 3/277, from Ishaq bin &#8216;Ammar: abu &#8216;Abdullah (as) told me: &#8220;O Ishaq, do you pray with them(Sunnies) in the Masjid?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: &#8220;Pray with them, the one who prays with them in the first row is like the one who unsheathed his sword in the cause of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Ibn Babaweih al-Qummi whom they call al-Saduq reports in &#8220;al-Hidayah&#8221; pg.53:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;And he (as) said: Visit their sick, go to their funerals and pray in their mosques.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the statements of their scholars in this matter, they are many and I quote some as examples:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Shaheed al-Awwal Muhammad Makki al-&#8216;Amili says in &#8220;al-Bayan&#8221; pg.142:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is definitely recommended(Mustahabb) to attend the congregational prayers of Ahlul-Khilaf(Sunnies), al-Sadiq (as) said: &#8220;He who pays with them in the first row&#8221; and from him (as): &#8220;It is accounted for those that don&#8217;t follow (Sunni prayer) to a similar extent as those that do, and the same applies to who prays the obligatory prayer (with them) and those that don&#8217;t.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Ishaq Fayyad said in &#8220;Ta&#8217;aleeq Mabsoutah&#8221; 10/448:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[In a group of accepted narrations, being present in their(Sunni) mosques and attending their Jama&#8217;ah(Congregational) prayers and funerals was encouraged, and in some(Narrations) that the prayer behind them is like the prayer behind the Prophet (SAWS).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar &#8216;Ali al-Shahrastani says in &#8220;Kitab Wudhu al-Nabi&#8221; 1/334:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Many narrations have been reported by al-Sadiq regarding the congregational prayer with al-&#8216;Amah(Sunnies) in order to protect Islamic unity, he said: &#8220;He who prays with them in the first row is like he who prays behind the Prophet (SAWS).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and his saying: &#8220;O Ishaq, do you pray with them(Sunnies) in the Masjid?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: &#8220;Pray with them, the one who prays with them in the first row is like the one who unsheathed his sword in the cause of Allah.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarim al-Shirazi says in &#8220;al-Qawa&#8217;ed al-Fiqhiya&#8221; 1/451:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the matter of: Is it permissible to pray behind them(Sunnies) when there is no fear but rather from a perspective of good relations and to be liked by them, as is the situation in our times usually, especially in the season of Hajj, the failure to attend  their Jama&#8217;ah(congregational prayers) does not create anything to be fearful from when it comes to the self and the wealth and family, but entering in their congregational prayers is better for Islamic-brotherhood and good relations. This is based on a group of narrations that affirm this and maybe they are Mutawatir in this sense.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The ugly hidden face of their call</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have no doubt that what I am about to uncover here will remove the smile from the faces of many Muslims who may have found some hope of unity in the narrations and declarations above. Here we shall briefly expose the other face of this &#8220;call of love and unity&#8221; so that its true image can be visible to all Muslims, this is the face the Shia try their hardest to hide from the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The First Issue: Their consensus on the impermissibility of praying behind any Muslim who is not a Twelver Imami Shia.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He who follows the statements of the Shia scholars in their books of Fiqh will find that they agree that the condition of Imamah in Salat(prayer) is reserved only for the ones whom they accept as &#8220;believers&#8221;, this means by default that the prayer behind any non-Imami Twelver is obsolete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Muhaqqiq Yusuf al-Bahrani quotes some of these narrations in &#8220;al-Hadaeq al-Nadirah&#8221; 10/4-6:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Thirdly &#8211; al-Iman, and it is to confirm the five Usool including the Imamah of the twelve Imams (as) and there is no difference among our companions that this is a condition. This is proven by plenty of narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From them, what is narrated in al-Kafi from Zurarah with two chains one of them being Sahih or Hasan, from Ibrahim bin Hashim al-Qummi:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was sitting with abu Ja&#8217;afar (as) when a man(Shia) entered on him and said: &#8220;May I be a sacrifice for you, I live next door to a Masjid and if I don&#8217;t pray with them they start saying bad things about me?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied: Now that you&#8217;ve mentioned this, Ameer al-Mumineen(&#8216;Ali) said: &#8220;He who hears the call(to prayer) and does not attend it without having an excuse (That prevents him from attending), then there is no prayer for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the man left and he told him: &#8220;Do not leave any prayer with them and behind every Imam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when he finally left, I told the Imam: &#8220;May I be a sacrifice for you, this saying of yours troubled me greatly, when the man asked for your Fatwa, what if his folks weren&#8217;t believers(Shia)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (as) laughed and replied to me: &#8220;I will not see you anywhere after this but here O Zurarah, for what more of a reason (to be used as an excuse) do you need that is greater than the fact that – he (the Sunni) is not to be followed in prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then he said: &#8220;O Zurarah, did you not see that I said: pray in your mosques and behind your Imams?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what is narrated by the Sheikh in the Sahih from abu Abdullah al-Barqi: I wrote to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as): &#8220;May I be a sacrifice for you, is it permissible to pray behind those who did not accept the Imamah of your father and grandfather (as)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied: &#8220;Do not pray behind him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also what is narrated in al-Faqih and al-Tahtheeb from the Sahih of Isma&#8217;eel al-Ju&#8217;ufi: I said to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as): &#8220;A man loves Ameer al-Mumineen (as) but does not disown his enemies, but says: He is more beloved to me than those who opposed him?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (as) replied: &#8220;He is confused and he is an enemy, so do not pray behind him, not at all, unless as Taqqiyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is narrated in al-Tahtheeb from Ibrahim ibn Shaybah: &#8220;I wrote to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as) asking him about the prayer behind the one who loves Ameer al-Mumineen (as) but at the same time wipes on his Khuffayn(socks), or behind the one who forbids the wiping but he wipes?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He wrote to me: &#8220;If you are stuck with them in a situation and you see no way out of this except praying, make your own call to prayer and then make Iqamah, if he beats you to the recitation then make Tasbeeh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What was narrated in the Sahih by al-Kulayni from Zurarah regarding al-Hassan: &#8220;I asked abu Ja&#8217;afar (as) about praying behind those who differ with us?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: &#8220;To me, they are of the same status as the walls.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From abu &#8216;Ali bin Rashid: I said to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as): &#8221; Verily your supporters (muwalika) have disagreed, so do I pray behind all of them?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he (as) said: &#8220;Do not pray except behind someone whose religion you trust.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What al-Kashshi narrated in Kitab al-Rijal from Yazid bin Hamad from abu al-Hassan (as): I said to him: &#8220;Do I pray behind someone I don&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied: &#8220;Do not pray except behind someone whose religion you trust.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And many other such narrations that show that the acts of worship of those who oppose us are not accepted and praying behind them is unacceptable.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassim al-Khoei in &#8220;Kitab al-Salat&#8221; 5/2/394-395, talks about the condition of Iman(Belief) when leading the prayer or being the Imam of the prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Meaning the belief in the twelve Imams (as) without any problems or doubts, and a group of narrations have pointed to this such as the Sahih of Zurarah about praying behind the Moukhalifeen(Sunnies), he (as) said: &#8220;To me, they are of the same status as walls.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the Sahih of al-Barqi: I wrote to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as): &#8220;May I be a sacrifice for you, is it permissible to pray behind those who did not accept the Imamah of your father and grandfather (as)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied: &#8220;Do not pray behind him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the Sahih of Isma&#8217;eel al-Ju&#8217;ufi: &#8220;A man loves Ameer al-Mumineen (as) but does not disown his enemies, but says: He is more beloved to me than those who opposed him?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (as) replied: &#8220;He is a confused person and he is an enemy, so do not pray behind him, not at all, unless as Taqqiyah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the Sahih of ibn Mahzayar: I wrote to Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali al-Reda (as): &#8220;Do I pray behind someone who professes the Jism (attributes Jism to Allah), and someone who professes the doctrine of Yunus?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he (as) wrote: &#8220;Do not pray behind them and do not give them anything of zakat.  And disown them, Allah has disowned them.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Khoei also said in &#8220;Kitab al-Ijtihad wal-Taqleed&#8221; pg.287:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is meant by trusting someone&#8217;s religion is that the Imam(Leader of prayer) must be a Twelver Imami, this is because of the narrations that prohibit praying behind the Mukhalifeen(Sunnies), and in some he (as) considers them like the walls.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Sadiq al-Roohani says in &#8220;Fiqh al-Sadiq&#8221; 6/266:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The second: al-Iman(The belief), meaning he has to recognize the Imamah of the twelve Imams (as) and that it is something which should not be doubted, the consensus regarding this was reported to us through a group. What supports it: many texts such as the Sahih of Zurarah from abu Ja&#8217;afar (as) about praying behind the Mukhalifeen, he (as) said: &#8220;To me, they are of the same status as walls.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And Sahih al-Barqi: He wrote to abu Ja&#8217;afar (as):&#8221; is it permissible to pray behind those who did not accept the Imamah of your father and grandfather (as)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He replied: &#8220;Do not pray behind him.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We conclude from the above, based on the declaration of their top scholars backed by the consensus of the Shia and their authentic narrations, that the prayer of the Shia behind a Sunni is invalid. Before we move on to the second issue, we need to state two seriously dangerous Shia beliefs and I apologize to the Muslims from what they are about to read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The first belief:</strong> That the Muslims who does not believe in Imamah is a Fasiq and praying behind him is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Muhaqqiq al-Ardabilee says in &#8220;Majma&#8217;a al-Faidah wal-Burhan&#8221; 3/246:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for placing the Iman as a condition: The proof for it was previously stated and it is the consensus, according to what is in al-Muntaha, and the narrations in the research of al-Jumu&#8217;ah, and he used as proofs: That the non-believer is an oppressor and a Fasiq, and emulating or imitating him (in prayer) would be considered like leaning towards him, this is forbidden by the saying of Allah: {And incline not towards those} (11:113)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Muhaqqiq Ahmad bin Muhammad Mahdi al-Naraqi says in &#8220;Mustanad al-Shia&#8221; 8/26:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The second: al-Iman in the special intended meaning, according to the current consensus and that which has been reported to us, and the countless narrations, and in the narration of Zurarah: about praying behind the Moukhalifeen, so he said: &#8220;To me they are of the status of walls.&#8221; adding this to the general narrations that show the invalidity of the acts of worship of the one who opposes us, and that the prayer behind him is not valid and that it is forbidden, and the orders given to those who stand behind their Imams in prayer to recite for themselves, and their content which shows that the condition of the religion of the Imam must be taken into consideration, they are also explicit in declaring that the one who opposes us is a Fasiq.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Hassan al-Najafi says in &#8220;Jawahir al-Kalam&#8221; 13/273:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What to take into consideration concerning the Imam (of prayer) is his Iman in the special sense which would make him an Imami Shia, and it(prayer) is not valid behind the one who opposes us, there is agreement on this, there is even a consensus on this matter reported through many ways and it is Mutawatir like the texts that order the Imami(who prays behind the Sunni) to recite (his own recitation) behind (the Imam) of the Mukhalifeen, and that they are of the status of walls. As well as all the specific narrations concerning this matter about the condition of the religion (of the Imam), as there is no Fisq greater than that.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Kathim al-Haeri says in &#8220;al-Qadaa fil-Fiqh al-Islami&#8221; pg.323:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Yes if we say: That the invalidity of the testimony of the Sunni is due to Fisq (…) Because the Jew is also a Fasiq in the same sense that the Sunni is a Fasiq, meaning they are Fasiqeen when it comes to &#8216;Aqaed(beliefs)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Kafi under the chapter &#8221; Chapter on the prayer behind one whom you do not follow (trust his faith)&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8216;Ali bin Ibrahim from his father (Ibrahim bin Hashim) from Hammad (bin &#8216;Isa) from Hariz (bin Abdillah) from Zurarah (bin A&#8217;yan) who said : I said to Abi Ja&#8217;afar (as) : the people narrate about the commander of the faithful &#8211; Ali (a.s) &#8211; that he prayed four Raka&#8217;at (units) of prayer after Friday congregational prayer without partitioning between them with the Taslim (as one does in between two different &#8211; two Raka&#8217;at Mustahhab/recommended prayers), so He (as) said : O Zurarah, indeed the commander of the faithful (&#8216;Ali) had prayed (the Friday congregational prayers) behind a Fasiq (Meaning the Caliphs Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman), so when he (the Sunni Caliph) completed that (leading the prayer) and left, the commander of the faithful (as) stood up and prayed four Raka&#8217;at of prayers without partitioning between them with the Taslim (i.e He (as) prayed a complete Dhuhr), so a man who was by his side (in the row) asked him : O Abal Hassan! you have prayed four Raka&#8217;at of prayer without partitioning between them? so He (as) said : They are four ambiguous Raka&#8217;at (calling into doubt the Sunni Imam’s nature) and remained silent; so (Abu Ja&#8217;afar (as) says) : I swear by Allah (swt), he the man (who had asked the question) did not understand what was said to him (by &#8216;Ali (as)).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ask the reader, have you seen more evil and more hatred in any religion or sect that equals that of the Twelver Shia? It surpasses all expectations when their contemporary grand Ayatullah al-Haeri likens the Muslims to Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Truly this saying of Allah fits these Shia scholars perfectly:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Hatred has already shown itself of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is yet greater.} [3:118]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This shows that their call to unity is laughable and that it is nothing more than Taqqiyah and Mudarat to trick the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The second belief:</strong> The prayer of the Muslim who does not believe in Imamah and all his other acts of worship are nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Shaheed al-Thani al-&#8216;Allamah Zain al-Deen al-&#8216;Amili says in &#8220;Rawd al-Jinan&#8221; pg.356-357:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Know that this ruling does not prove the correctness of the act of worship of the Moukhalif(Sunni), but what is correct is that it is corrupt even if it has gathered all the necessary conditions except Iman, and Iman is a condition of the validity of the prayer (…) When the Mukhalif dies is his condition , he will be punished because of it like the Kafir (…) although there are plenty of narrations proving the invalidity of all acts of worship of the one who does not believe in Wilayah(Imamah), from them is what al-Saduq narrated with his Isnad to &#8216;Ali bin al-Hussein: &#8220;If a man was given the entire age of Nuh with his people, a thousand years minus fifty, and he fasts the days and prays the nights between al-Rukn and al-Maqam, then he met Allah without believing in our Wilayah, all of it will not benefit him.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Muhaqqiq al-Subzawari in &#8220;Thakheerat al-Mi&#8217;ad&#8221; 1/2/302:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What proves it is what generally proves the invalidity of the worship of the Mukhalif and the narrations stating that the prayer behind the Mukalifeen is not accepted and the forbiddance of praying behind them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Faqih al-Muhaqqiq al-Mirza abu al-Qassim al-Qummi says in &#8220;Ghanaem al-Ayyam&#8221;2/31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for al-Iman, what is meant from it is that he must be a Twelver, for the reasons we mentioned, and for the specific narrations that prove the invalidity of the acts of worship of the one who opposes us, and that imitating the Waqifiyah(Shia sect) is forbidden.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassim al-Khoei says in &#8220;Kitab al-Sawm&#8221; 2/328:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And we said that there are many narrations stating that the correctness of the acts of worship is tied to (the belief in) al-Wilayah(Imamah), the one who is not a Muwali(Follower) of the twelve Imams (as) all his deeds are like a mirage, they are non-existent]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear reader, look at this horrible image they painted for us, of a Man who believe in Allah and his angels and books and prophets and the final day, he does his best every day, treating people with kindness and calling the Kouffar to Islam, a man who fasts as often as he can to please Allah, a man who prays during the long nights until his feet get swollen from standing, and on the day of judgment, all his good deeds and acts of worship are annulled, simply because he isn&#8217;t a Twelver Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah punish these Shia scholars for their evil beliefs, they place the pious Muslims and the Kuffar and Mushrikeen in the same category, they have accused all the Muslims in the lands and throughout all the ages of being heretics, and then with all audacity they claim to be the ones calling to Islamic unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Second Issue: That their prayer behind us is not real, it is only an apparent image.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To sum up the above, the Shia scholars have consensus that the one to lead the prayer must be a Twelver Shia, that praying behind a Sunni is impermissible because we are considered like &#8220;Walls&#8221; and we are Fasiqeen and our acts of worship are invalid by default.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we need to know what is the meaning of that prayer which they allowed at the beginning of this study, the prayer which they claimed creates unity and brotherhood between Muslims. It turns out that prayer was not real, it is a fake outer image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah &#8216;Ali al-TabaTabae says in &#8220;Riyad al-Masael&#8221; 4/357:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Based on the fact that imitating(emulating) the Mukhalif (in prayer) is not a real imitation but a partial or semi-imitation.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh Murtada al-Ansari says in &#8220;Kitab al-Salat&#8221; 2/471:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Issue: Reciting (One&#8217;s own recitation) behind the un-acceptable Imam(Sunni) is obligatory, as imitating them is nothing more than an apparent image.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi says in &#8220;Bihar al-Anwar&#8221; 85/45:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Clarification: &#8220;Behind the Imam&#8221; means the evil Imams which were present in both their times (as), they used to pray behind them as Taqqiyah, and they did not make the Niyyah(Intention) of imitating them, they used to recite for themselves and perform their own prayers.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I feel the need to clarify something for the readers myself, what is meant by all the above, is that when the Shia prays behind the Sunni, he isn&#8217;t actually imitating or following the Sunni Imam, he deceives the Imam by making him think that he is praying behind him in congregation. However, in reality that prayer is nothing more than an image, an act of theatre, as the Shia is actually performing his own prayer and is reciting his own recitation independently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Saleh al-Mazandarani says in &#8220;Sharh Usool al-Kafi&#8221; 12/151:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8220;And attend the congregational prayers with your folks in their mosques&#8221; means with them in the apparent image of congregation, even if one knows that he is actually praying alone as some of the narrations stated.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Faqih al-Muhaqqiq Aqa Reda al-Hamdani says in &#8220;Misbah al-Faqih&#8221; 2/2/645:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is apparent is that he does not mean the true imitation of the Imam (of prayer) as that requires him to have the necessary conditions of being an Imam, but it is only a convenient image for that specific time as a Taqqiyah, so the one who prays behind them is as if he is praying on his own.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah al-&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Hussein al-Isfahani says in &#8220;Kitab Salat al-Jama&#8217;ah&#8221; pg.216:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And what confronts them are clearer narrations proving that it is the image of a prayer just as it is an image of a congregational prayer.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh Muhammad Hassan al-Qadiri says in &#8220;al-Bahth fi Risalat al-&#8216;Asharah&#8221; pg.192-193:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And the narration proves to us that what is required is only to participate with them in the image of an act of worship not in its reality]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassem al-Khoei says in &#8220;Kitab al-Tahara&#8221; 4/313-314:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What we need to point to in this topic, is that praying behind them is not like praying behind the just Imam, but in actuality based on the narrations it is an image of a prayer, al-&#8216;Amah(Sunnies) think it is a prayer and that they are being followed as Imams. From this we see why the narrations only speak about praying with them but not actually following or imitating them, so he(Shia) enters to pray with them, he makes his own Adhan(Call to prayer) and his own Iqamah, and he recites for himself in a way that no one could hear his voice.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Sadiq al-Roohani says in &#8220;Fiqh al-Sadiq&#8221; 6/323:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then what is meant by this phrase is that praying with them is Taqqiyah, as it draws the benefits of the two acts, meaning the act of the second prayer even if it is only an image, It is better than the first one which is real because of the great benefits it creates]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">O Muslims do not rejoice with that payer, it is not real as you have been fooled to believe, it is only a fake image performed to trick and deceive the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Third Issue: They show that they are following along but that is just to trick the Muslims.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I present the words of some of the Shia scholars who openly declared this calamity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Shaheed al-Awwal al-&#8216;Allamah Muhammad bin Makki al-&#8216;Amili said in &#8220;Thikra al-Shia bi Ahkam al-Shari&#8217;ah&#8221; 4/469-470:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The eighth: There is a dispensation(Rukhsa) that when one is compelled to pray behind the Mukhalif, he can make it look like he is following along apparently but he does not make the real prostration(Sujoud) this has been narrated by &#8216;Ubeid bin Zurarah from abu &#8216;Abdullah (as), when he said: &#8220;As for me, I pray with them and show them that I am making Sujoud, but in reality I am not making Sujoud.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Hassan al-Bajnourdi in &#8220;al-Qawa&#8217;ed al-Fiqhiya&#8221; 4/73:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Yes, it is correct to say that if he(Shia) was able to conform in the obligatory (prayers) during his work through trickery, and to give them(Sunnies) the illusion that he is doing as they are doing &#8211; and if he didn&#8217;t do what they did it wouldn&#8217;t be neglecting Taqiyyah &#8211; and it isn&#8217;t necessary for him to do so (out of fear of) immediate harm or after a duration of time, neither upon him, or others from his group, (either way) it is obligatory.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Ja&#8217;afar Kashif al-Ghataa in &#8220;Kashf al-Ghataa&#8221; 1/265:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And one needs to have the intention(Niyyah) of praying separately with them, and to show outwardly that he has participated in their congregational prayer, then he should recite what he can from Adhkaar and other things in a low voice while he is following their Imams, and it would be better if he were to pray the prescribed payer before he attends the congregational prayer with them]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Hassan al-Qadiri says in &#8220;al-Bahth fi Risalat al-&#8216;Ashara&#8221; pg.193:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What we conclude from all of this: What we draw from the narrations is that it is required to enter their mosques and enter into their prayers, to show them that one is following them]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Behbudi says in the margin #1 of the book &#8220;Bihar al-Anwar&#8221; 79/336:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The way to view these narrations is that they (the Imams) have allowed their Shia to pray in their houses, and perform both obligatory and optional prayers consecutively, (in an attempt) to dissociate (their actions) from the imitation of the leaders of the opposing sects.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Fourth issue: That this prayer is considered unacceptable by many of their scholars.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarim al-Shirazi in &#8220;al-Qawa&#8217;ed al-Fiqhiya&#8221; 1/455-457:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We find in more than one narration in chapter (6) from the chapters of &#8220;al-Jama&#8217;ah&#8221; that this prayer is not counted, but he(Shia) has to pray the (true) prescribed prayer before it or after it, while the prayer with them(Sunnies) would be desired or obligatory Taqqiyah only to seem likable to them or out of fear]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah Muhammad Ishaq Fayyad says in &#8220;al-Mabahith al-Usooliyah&#8221; 3/409:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[So what we can use as reference is the third group (of narrations) that is not opposed (by other narrations), these (narrations) say that it is permissible to imitate them with the condition of reciting for yourself on your own, and yes there are general benefits from joining them in Salat(prayer) and imitating their Imam such as showing unity between the Muslims and preserving the interests of the (shia) sect, but it doesn&#8217;t validate his prayer unless he makes his own recitation]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Hadith in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; 3/373, in which the Shia Imam supposedly says that the non-Twelver Muslim who leads the prayer is like a wall, some of their biggest scholars have commented on this narration, I list some examples:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh Murtada al-Ansari said in &#8220;Kitab al-Salat&#8221; 1/309:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then this also supports (the view) that the Mukhalif Imam(Sunni) who stands in front (of the Shia), is of the rank of a wall, meaning his presence is like his absence it doesn&#8217;t affect anything.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi said in &#8220;Miraat al-&#8216;Uqool&#8221; 15/256:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Meaning their (Sunnie&#8217;s) prayer and recitation are not relied upon and there is no harm in being near them, and it is possible that the meaning is to forbid us from imitating them (in prayer).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Muhaqqiq of al-Kafi, &#8216;Ali Akbar Ghafari commented on this narration by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Meaning their prayer and recitation are not relied upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in the authentic narration from al-Kafi under the chapter &#8220;on the man who prays alone and then repeats it in Jama’ah or leads a people in prayer having prayed (alone) before&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin Yahya from Ahmad bin Muhammad from &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Isa from Sam’ah (bin Mihran) who said : I asked Him (as) about a man who was praying (an obligatory prayer &#8211; alone), so (while he was doing that) an imam emerges (wishing to lead a congregational prayer for it), and he (the man) has (already) prayed a single Raka&#8217;at (from his individual prayer), so He (as) said : if it is a just imam (who emerges), then he should pray the other Raka&#8217;at (to make it two) and (complete this prayer) and make it a Nafila, and then enter with the imam in his (the imam’s) prayer (making it a new beginning). And if it is not a just imam (who emerges), then he should continue with his own prayer (that he had started and was in), and pray the other Raka&#8217;at (of his individual prayer &#8211; while making it look as though he has started afresh, behind or) with the imam, and he should sit in it for the duration in which he can say : ‘There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger’ (as his Tashahud &#8211; after this imam’s first Raka&#8217;at and what is his own second), then complete his own prayer behind the imam as best as he can (since he will finish before the imam), for Taqiyyah is wide (all-encompassing), and there is not a thing (done) in Taqiyyah but its performer is rewarded for it, if Allah wills.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this prayer is close to being a series of imaginary moves to give the illusion of congregational prayer, but according to their scholars this fake act does not fulfill the task of the prescribed prayer so the Shia needs to pray on his own, make his own call to prayer, make his own Iqamah, recite his own verses while he moves in a way that gives the illusion of following along behind the Sunni Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Fifth issue: That they may curse the Muslim who leads them in prayer.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their Sahih from Muhammad ibn Ya&#8217;aqoub al-Kulayni in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; 3/380:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A large number of my teachers from Ahmad bin Muhammad from Husayn bin Said from Ya&#8217;aqoub bin Yaqteen who said : I said to Abu al-Hassan (as): May I be ransomed for you, the time for (the prayer of) Dhuhr arrives, so we do not have the opportunity to pray it in its earliest time (due to their presence), until they (the Sunnies) begin praying it, so we join them for it, and pray with them, then they stand and depart, so we stand and pray the &#8216;Asr making it look as though we are praying of the Nafila (after Dhuhr), then they come for the &#8216;Asr and proceed for it, so we pray (again) behind them (is this right?), so He (as) said : &#8220;Pray with them, may Allah not grant them peace.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Muhaqqiq al-Ardabilee says while commenting in &#8220;Majma&#8217;a al-Faidah wal-Burhan&#8221; 3/289:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And what is in the Sahih of &#8216;Ali bin Yaqteen, &#8220;they proceed for it&#8221; meaning the &#8216;Asr prayer, so do we pray with them? So he (as) said: &#8220;Pray with them may Allah not bless them&#8221; And this is explicit when it comes to the second but it was apparently accompanied by Taqqiyah, and in this (narration) is the proof for (the permissibility of) cursing them (Sunnies).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear reader do you see the great tragedy that lies behind that &#8220;Innocent call&#8221;? Is this brotherhood and unity? to pray behind them &#8220;May Allah not bless them&#8221;!? Will the Shia not miss any chance to curse and insult and slander and make Takfeer and Tafseeq on those who differ with them? They couldn&#8217;t even wait until after the prayer is finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Sixth issue: The Shia takes the reward of the Muslims praying around him and leaves them his sins.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the worst signs of hatred and enmity is what can been seen in the following Shia beliefs:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thiqatul-Islam Muhammad bin Ya&#8217;aqoub al-Kulayni narrated in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; 3/380-381:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From al-Hussein bin &#8216;Abdullah al-Arjani, from abu &#8216;Abdullah (as): &#8220;He who prays (the prescribed prayer) at home, then went to one of their (Sunni) mosques to pray with them, he shall leave with their rewards.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh al-Taefa al-Tusi narrates in &#8220;Tahtheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; 3/273:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From ibn Saleh from abu al-Hassan al-Awwal (as): I said to him: &#8220;The man from among us(Shia) prays his prayer at home with his door closed, then he leaves to pray with his neighbors(Sunnies), will his prayer at home alone be counted as a congregational prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (as) then said: &#8220;He who prays at home, Allah will give him double the reward of the congregational prayer, for him it will be fifty levels, as for the one who prays with his neighbors(Sunnies) Allah will write for him the reward of the one who prays behind Rassul-Allah (SAWS), he will leave for them(Sunnies) his sins and shall take their rewards.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhammad Saleh al-Mazandarani says in &#8220;Sharh Usool al-Kafi&#8221; 12/151:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8220;And attend with your people(Sunnies) their prayers in their mosques&#8221; means with them in the apparent image of a congregational prayer, even if you are in actuality praying alone as the narrations stated, with the benefit that you actually leave with the rewards of their prayer.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Ja&#8217;afar Kashif al-Ghataa says in &#8220;Kashf al-Ghataa&#8221; 1/265:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[But leading them(Sunnies) and praying with them(Sunnies) has great virtue and reward, it was narrated that the one praying behind them in the first row is like the one who prays behind the Prophet (SAWS) in the first row, and it was narrated that Allah will forgive the sins of the one praying with them based on the number of Mukhalifeen(Sunnies), and it was narrated that the one who prays with them gets the same reward as if he prayed behind a just (Shia) Imam, and it was narrated that the one who attends their prayer is like the one who unsheathed his sword in the cause of Allah, and that the Prophet (SAWS) gave them (in marriage) some of his daughters, and that &#8216;Ali prayed behind them, and that al-Hassan and al-Hussein both prayed behind Marwan, and that the one who prays with them shall leave with their rewards and shall leave them his sins (…) And that the Imami (Shia) have more right to their (Sunni) mosques than they do]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheikh Muhammad Hassan al-Qadiri says in &#8220;al-Bahth fi Risalat al-&#8216;Asharah&#8221; pg.192:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[With the content of the two Sahih (narrations) by &#8216;Abdullah bin Sinan and the narration of ibn Saleh. And the narration of al-Arjani and in the last two we are shown that the one who participates in their prayer will leave them his sins and leave with their rewards, and that the one who prays in their mosques shall take their rewards.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassem al-Khoei says in &#8220;Kitab al-Sawm&#8221; 1/262:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was stated in some narrations that if he prayed with them as Taqqiyah, then all the reward of those who are praying (in the mosque) will be his, and that Godly mercy shall descend from the heaven, and if it doesn&#8217;t find someone who is deserving of it then it will ascend, unless there is one (Shia) who is deserving of it, for this reason the entire reward of all of people in the mosque is given to him.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intelligent observer can see with clarity the amount of deep animosity these Shia scholars have stored inside their malicious hearts, this is the evil that they try to implant in the hearts of their followers, how else can we explain this hatred towards the innocent Muslims who left the world in order to pray for Allah? These Muslims stand in submission and obedience to their Lord, bowing their heads to their creator, and what is the result of all of this? they leave the mosque with no reward, instead they now have to carry on their backs the sins of the Taqqiyah practicing Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Seventh issue: Their belief that some of our actions during prayer are taken from Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Come now dear reader and let us explore what the Shia think of the prayer of the Muslims in the four corners of the earth, do the Shia think that the Muslims are praying like the Prophet (SAWS) who instructed us in his Authentic Sahih Hadith in al-Bukhari: He (SAWS) stood in front of his companions and said: &#8220;Pray as you see me pray.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will give two examples:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example -1-</strong> Saying &#8220;Ameen&#8221; after one finishes the recitation of al-Fatiha:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leader of their sect al-Tusi in &#8220;al-Istibsar&#8221; 1/319 and &#8220;Tahtheeb al-Ahkam&#8221; 2/75:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[From Mu&#8217;awiyah bin Wahb: I asked abu &#8216;Abdullah (as): &#8220;Do I say &#8216;Ameen&#8217; after I finish reciting: {not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray} (1:7)&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;They are the Jews and the Christians.&#8221; And he did not answer to that.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Bahaa-ul-Deen al-&#8216;Amili comments on the narration in &#8220;al-Habl al-Mateen&#8221; pg.225:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The seventeenth narration shows the impermissibility of saying &#8220;Ameen&#8221; during Salat(Prayer), because the fact that he (as) never answered it, instead him (as) going to explain the meaning of &#8221; those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray&#8221; is a sign of Taqqiyah, and that some of those who were present (in that Majlis) were from the Mukhalifeen(Sunnies), so he (as) gave them the illusion that Mu&#8217;awiya&#8217;s question was regarding the explanation of the verse, and maybe when he (as) said &#8220;The Jews and the Christians&#8221; it was a form of demonization to the Mukhalifeen(Sunnies), and that what is meant is that the ones who say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; in prayer are the Jews and the Christians, meaning they are considered to be included in their ranks and a part of them]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Baqir al-Sabzawari said in &#8220;Thakheerat al-Mi&#8217;ad&#8221; 1/2/277:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Him (as) not answering that question, instead explaining the verse is a sign of Taqqiyah, and maybe we can consider his (as) saying &#8220;Jews and the Christians&#8221; as demonization for the Mukhalifeen and that what is meant is that those who say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; in prayer are a part of the Jews and Christians so one must not follow them in this]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah abu al-Qassem al-Khoei says in &#8220;Kitab al-Salat&#8221; 4/541:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[But it is possible in &#8220;al-Jawahir&#8221; that what is intended from his (as) saying: &#8220;the Jews and the Christians&#8221; is the actual answer, that this is an act of theirs when their Imam is reciting and it is a demonization to the &#8216;Amah(Sunnies) who follow their path.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah ibn al-Mutahhar al-Helli says in &#8220;Tathkirat al-Fuqahaa&#8221; 3/162:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Issue number (245): It is Haram(Forbidden) to say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; at the end of al-Hamd according to the Imamis(Shia), and the prayer is rendered invalid if one says this whether the one saying it is praying alone, or leading in congregation or being led.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leader of their Muhadditheen ibn Babaweih al-Qummi al-Saduq says in &#8220;Man la Yahduruh al-Faqih&#8221; 1/390:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is not permitted that one says &#8220;Ameen&#8221; after reciting the Fatiha of the book, as this is the saying of the Christians.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leader of their sect during his time, al-Mufid says in &#8220;al-Muqni&#8217;ah&#8221; pg.105:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And must not say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; after finishing al-Hamd, like the Jews and their Nasibi brothers]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-Shaheed al-Thani Zain-ul-Deen al-&#8216;Amili says in &#8220;Rawd al-Jinan&#8221; pg.267:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (as) said: &#8220;They are the Jews and the Christians&#8221; where he refrained from answering that question and instead went on to explain the verse, and some of our companions explained this by saying that those who say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; are Jews and Christians.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Aqa Reda al-Hamdani says in &#8220;Misbah al-Faqih&#8221; 2/1/312:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: The fact that he (as) refrained from answering that question but went on to explain the verse shows that this matter is not acceptable according to him (as), but it was not openly declared out of Taqqiyah, and most probably what was meant by his (as) saying &#8220;Jews and Christians&#8221; was a hidden answer pointing to those who say it(Ameen), and it is also possible that he meant that the Jews and Christians are the ones who says it while their Imam is reciting as is permitted in their prayer, pointing to the &#8216;Amah(Sunnies) who follow their path.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ask the readers, do you say &#8220;Ameen&#8221; because Ahlul-Kitab say it? or because the Prophet (SAWS) instructed us to do this in the authentic narrations?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example -2-</strong> Placing the right hand over the left hand while standing in prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And placing the right over the left in prayer is what the Shia call &#8220;Takattuf&#8221; or &#8220;Takfeer&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah ibn al-Mutahhar al-Helli says in &#8220;Tathkirat al-Fuqahaa&#8221; 3/259:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Issue number (330): al-Takfeer invalidates the prayer and it is placing the right over the left during recitation and the scholars of the (Shia) sect agree on this &#8211; al-Sheikh and al-Murtada both said &#8211; (…) al-Baqir (as) said: &#8220;(…) And do not make Takfeer(Placing right over left), for it is something that the Zoroastrians do.&#8221; Also Muhammad bin Muslim asked one of the two (Imams) about the man who places in prayer his right hand over his left? He (as) replied: &#8220;That is (called) al-Takfeer, do not do it.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leader of the sect during his time, Sheikh al-Mufid says in &#8220;al-Muqni&#8217;ah&#8221; pg.104-105:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And must not place his right on his left in his prayer, like the Jews and the Christians and their followers from the misguided Nasibis(Enemies of Ahlul-bayt).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Muhammad Hassan Najafi who was the head of the Shia Madhab in his time says in &#8220;Jawahir al-Kalam&#8221; 11/19:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was said about &#8216;Umar that when they brought him the prisoners from the non-Arabs(&#8216;Ajam), they did Takfeer(placing right over left) in front of him, so he asked about it and they told him that they did this as a sign of submission in front of their Kings, so he saw that it was good to do it for Allah in prayer but did not pay attention to the ugliness of imitating the Zoroastrians in Shari&#8217;ah.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah Najm-ul-Deen al-Tibsi says in &#8220;al-Irsaal wal-Takfeer bayn al-Sunnah wal-Bid&#8217;ah&#8221; pg.13-14:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[There are many narrations from Ahlul-Bayt (as) prohibiting al-Takfeer and describing it as being from Zoroastrianism]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And he also said on pg.18-19:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It was said that it was innovated by the Caliph &#8216;Umar bin al-Khattab, he took it from the non-Arab prisoners.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Sadiq al-Shirazi said in &#8220;Sharae&#8217;e al-Islam&#8221; by al-Helli, 1/72, margin #235:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is what is called &#8220;al-Takattuf&#8221; and &#8220;al-Takfeer&#8221; that the &#8216;Amah(Sunnies) practice, following the path of &#8216;Umar bin al-Khattab, and &#8216;Umar had taken it from the Zoroastrians then inserted it into Salat, this was one of his innovations and it was never done by the Prophet (SAWS) nor his Ahul-Bayt (as)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah al-Khoei says in &#8220;Kitab al-Salat&#8221; 4/445-446:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It is no secret that the act of &#8220;Takfeer&#8221; was never practiced during the time of the great Prophet (SAWS), even though it was narrated through several chains that do not come through us(Shia) thus they are all fabricated and false (…) Then we should not be hesitant to class it as one of the later innovations after his time (SAWS). As for the time of the first caliph as it is said or most probably the second as we see in the narration, that when they brought the Persian prisoners to &#8216;Umar, and he saw them in that state so he asked for the reason and they answered that this is what they do in front of their kings to glorify them, so he was pleased with it and ordered that it be done in prayer as Allah is more worthy of praise.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice this poisonous attack against the Muslims and against  the pious and noble commander of believers &#8216;Umar bin al-Khattab (ra), how can these evil men reduce the Muslims all over the world to Zoroastrians!?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Eight issue: They believe that refusing brotherhood with the rest of the Muslims and being their enemies is obligatory.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the final issue that we will be discussing to conclude this research, it will clearly deny all possibility of them actually wanting to pray with us out of love and unity, it will show that being the enemies of those who oppose them in belief is actually one of the main pillars of this horrible Shia sect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We shall quote the biggest of their contemporary scholars and leaders of their sect:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">al-&#8216;Allamah al-Sheikh Muhammad Hassan al-Najafi has denied any form of brotherhood between them and the rest of the Muslims, he says in &#8220;Jawahir al-Kalam&#8221; 22/63:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[How can one even imagine brotherhood between the believer(Shia) and the Mukhalif(Sunni) after many narrations and verses have reached us through Tawatur saying that it is obligatory to be their enemies and that it is obligatory for us to disown them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah abu al-Qassem al-Khoei has admitted that the absence of brotherhood between the Shia and the rest of the Muslims is something established in their Madhab, he says in &#8220;Misbah al-Fuqahaa&#8221; 1/505:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What we benefit from this verse and the narrations, is that backbiting(Gheebah) against a believer(Shia) is forbidden, and what is obviously clear is that there is no brotherhood or bonds between us(Shia) and the Mukhalifeen(Sunnies), this is also what is meant from the general narrations of occultation.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed al-Hakeem has admitted that one cannot include Ahlul-Sunnah in the circle of brotherhood with the Shia, he said in &#8220;Misbah al-Minhaj &#8211; al-Taqleed&#8221; pg.302:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And what is obviously apparent is that there is no respect, no loyalty and no rights to the non-Believer(Sunni), but rather he is counted among the enemies. What was narrated  in cursing the Mukhalifeen(Sunnies) and insulting them and disowning them demands from us that we permit backbiting(Gheebah) them]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Muhammad Radi al-Radawi says in &#8220;Al-Tuhfah al-Radawiyyah&#8221; under the chapter &#8220;These are our brothers and this is their belief concerning us&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Refuting those who misguide people by saying: There is no difference between us and Sunnies and we are brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Imam al-Baqir says: &#8220;There is no religion for he who follows those who disobey Allah.&#8221; They (Sunnies) consider it a part of their religion to follow their leaders who have usurped the rights of Ahlul-Bayt and oppressed them. Our Imam al-Rida says: &#8220;Whoever befriends the one who disowns us or disowns our friend or praises one who criticizes us  or honors he who opposes us, then we are not from him and he is not from us.&#8221; So where did this brother-hood between us and them come from? Due tell if you are truthful.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the Wali al-Faqih and leader of the Iranian republic, Grand Ayatullah al-Khomeini says in &#8220;al-Makasib al-Muharramah&#8221; 1/251 when commenting on the narration of their Imam: &#8220;Backbiting(Gheebah) is when you say about your brother something that Allah has concealed&#8221;, Khomeini said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When it comes to explaining it we took brotherhood into consideration, but the rest (of the Muslims) are not our brothers even if they are (called) Muslims.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on the same page he says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And one should not doubt that all of the narrations about backbiting are only talking about the believer who is loyal to the truthful Imam (as)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on pg.250 he also says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And those (narrations) mentioning a brother do not include them(Sunnies) as there is no brotherhood between us and them, after it was made obligatory to disown them and their sect and their leaders as the narrations and Usool stated.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how Khomeini laid out the foundations of his republic of Iran, this is how Iran should treat its Muslim neighbors such as Afghanistan and &#8216;Iraq, but to be fair Khomeini was not the one to invent this matter, this was deeply rooted in their books of Hadith and Usool as he stated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This O dear reader was a quick tour in the depths of their books, although it has yielded dangerous results of the utmost importance, because it uncovered a phenomenon that affects the daily lives of the Muslims and how they interact and coexist with the Twelver Shia sect. In the interest of fairness we say that many of the Shia laymen do not know this stuff, many who are fortunate to read this book will be in a state of shock and maybe it could push them to dig deeper into their Madhab and research it in order to know its true face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do not blame many of the pious pure hearted Muslim laymen for believing the Shia &#8220;Call to unity&#8221; and I do not blame them for buying into that act called &#8220;Congregation prayer with the Shia&#8221;, because the Imami Shia and especially their scholars have perfected the art of trickery and deceit, and I wouldn&#8217;t expect any less from a sect that has been living on Taqqiyah and feeding on lies to survive for the past couple of centuries, but the Sunnah of Allah in this earth cannot be broken nor changed, as Allah has promised to expose the evil in their chests for all to see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that Allah would never expose their [feelings of] hatred?}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Holy Quran &#8211; 47:29]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Muslims of pure hearts and healthy minds, these verses are for you to ponder:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other than yourselves, for they will not spare you [any] ruin. They wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have certainly made clear to you the signs, if you will use reason. Here you are loving them but they are not loving you, while you believe in the Scripture &#8211; all of it. And when they meet you, they say, &#8220;We believe.&#8221; But when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage. Say, &#8220;Die in your rage. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.&#8221;}</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Holy Quran &#8211; 3:118-119]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8211; The End &#8211;<br />
