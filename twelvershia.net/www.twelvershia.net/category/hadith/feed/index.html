<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[sa] (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>



<p>Earlier in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the expositions</a> of Answering-Ansar’s lies, it was shown how even a narration found in one of the most prominent Islamic texts, <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, became a target of their deceptive methodology of argumentation because it proves the marriage of `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb with Umm Kulthūm bint `Alī (ra). Of course, those who are familiar with Answering-Ansar and the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> paranoia concerning this marriage know that their deception would not simply end at blatantly lying about the text of the narration.</p>



<p>That narration is:</p>



<p>قال ثعلبة بن أبي مالك إن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قسم مروطا بين نساء من نساء المدينة فبقي مرط جيد فقال له بعض من عنده يا أمير المؤمنين أعط هذا ابنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم التي عندك يريدون أم كلثوم بنت علي فقال عمر أم سليط أحق وأم سليط من نساء الأنصار ممن بايع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال عمر فإنها كانت تزفر لنا القرب يوم أحد</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik said: ‘`Umar (ra) divided up some garments among some of the women of Madīna. One excellent garment remained and one of those with him said: ‘Commander of the believers! Give this to the (grand) daughter of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) to whom you are married—meaning Umm Kul<u>th</u>ūm the daughter of `Alī. `Umar (ra) replied: ‘Umm Salīţ is more entitled. Umm Salīţ was one of the people of Anşār who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allāh (saws).’ `Umar (ra) added: ‘She carried waterskins for us on the day of Uĥud.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 3, page 222 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>After disapproving the text of this narration by lying and advancing a barrage of inane and poorly constructed linguistic arguments, the Answering-Ansar team moves on to criticize its chain of transmission.</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The people of knowledge can identify the deceptive nature of this argument as soon as they first read it. In fact, even a student of knowledge can. But for those who do not know, this analysis concerning the chain of transmission by the Answering-Ansar team is based on transparent dishonesty.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar has stated that the chain of transmission of this narration is unreliable because it is related by Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra). To support this claim, they have proposed the following points about Tha`laba (ra):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is not mentioned in any of the texts pertaining to <em>r</em><em>ijāl</em> [narrators of <em>ĥadī<u>th</u></em>].</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Dhahabī, who includes “all manner” of narrators in his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, has not mentioned him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is a completely unknown person.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, let us examine these claims and observe how much truth there is to them:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One – Tha`laba (ra) in the Texts of <em>Rijāl</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik’s “name is extant from the texts of rijjal.” This, unfortunately, is a barefaced lie because Tha`laba (ra) is mentioned in both <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts of narrator-biographies [<em>rijāl</em>].</p>

</ul>



<p>And in case there remains any doubt, let us also quote some of the abovementioned works so the readers know what the texts of <em>rijāl</em> say about him under his biographical&nbsp;entry&nbsp;[<em>tarjama</em>].</p>



<p>The author of the <em>Şaĥīĥ</em>, Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī himself, writes in <em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي المديني كان كبيرا امام بني قريظة سمع عمر وحارثة بن النعمان وعن ابن عمر سمع منه ابن الهاد والزهري وابنه مالك</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī al-Madīnī: He was great; <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža. He heard narrations from `Umar, Ĥāri<u>th</u>a ibn al-Nu`mān and Ibn `Umar, and Ibn al-Hād, al-Zuhrī and his son Mālik heard narrations from him.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 2, page 174 [Diyarbakir]</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the head <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī, writes in his <em>Rijāl</em> while listing the Companions (ra) who narrated from the Prophet (saws):</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk, the Quražī.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Rijāl al-Ţūsī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460), page 31 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī, who was a renowned <em>Sunnī</em> scholar and master of narrations, also mentions in <em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي المديني إمام مسجد بني قريظة أخرج البخاري في الجهاد وغير موضع عن الزهري عنه عن عمر بن الخطاب وقيس بن سعد قال الكلاباذي له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá, al-Quražī al-Madīnī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī has documented (his) narrations in the (book of) <em>Jihād</em>, and another place, from al-Zuhrī, and from `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>aţţāb and Qays ibn Sa`d. al-Kalābā<u>dh</u>ī said: ‘His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ li man <u>Kh</u>arraj `anh al-Bukhārī fī al-Jāmi` al-Şaĥīĥ</em>, of Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī (d. 474), volume 1, page 447 [Marrakech]</li>
</ul>



<p>In his voluminous and illustrious work on narrators, the <em>Sunnī</em> pinnacle Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī states:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي حليف الأنصار أبو مالك ويقال أبو يحيى المدني إمام مسجد بني قريظة له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá—al-Madanī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Kamāl fī Asmā’ al-Rijāl</em>, of Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī (d. 742), volume 4, page 397 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the major <em>Sunnī</em> scholar of narrations and expert in the field of its narrators, Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī, also writes in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي له رؤية وسمع عمر وعنه ابناه منظور وأبو مالك والزهري</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: His vision (of the Prophet) is proven. He heard narrations from `Umar. His two sons Manžūr and Abū Mālik, and al-Zuhrī heard narrations from him.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if fī Ma`rifat man lahu Riwāya min al-Kutub al-Sitta</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 284 [Jeddah]</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Mīrzā Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī, a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and expert in the field of narrators, writes in <em>Manhaj al-Maqāl</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Manhaj al-Maqāl fī Taĥqīq Aĥwāl al-Rijāl</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī (d. 1028), volume 3, page 130 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author of one of the main texts of <em>rijāl</em> among the <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>, al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī writes in the same work:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي من أصحاب الرسول صلى الله عليه وآله</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: He is from the Companions of the Messenger (saws).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī (d. 1044), volume 1, page 317 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> al-Astarābādī’s and al-Tafrishī’s printed works have&nbsp;a diacritical point missing from “al-Quražī” but the correct word is with a point as elucidated by <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> editors.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī also writes:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Jāmi` al-Ruwāt fī Izāĥat al-Ishtibāhāt `an al-Ţuruq wa al-Isnād</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī (d. 1101), volume 1, page 140 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in short, the famous and major texts of <em>rijāl</em> separately&nbsp;mention&nbsp;Tha`laba (ra) with words that prove nothing but his praiseworthiness. But the Answering-Ansar team confidently “refutes” the chain of transmission by deceptively misleading their readers into thinking that the texts of <em>rijāl</em> do not even mention the <em>name</em> of Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra).</p>

<p>This is what one calls mixing the truth with falsehood. al-Dhahabī has mentioned the biography of Tha`laba (ra) in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>, <em>Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Islām</em> and <em>al-Tajrīd</em>. A quote from <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em> has already been cited and the following is what al-Dhahabī states about him in his dictionary of the Companions of the Prophet (saws), <em>al-Tajrīd</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي إمام بني قريظة ولد في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وله رؤية وطال عمره روى عنه إبنه أبو مالك وصفوان بن سليم له حديثان مرسلان</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá,</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe. He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and his vision (of him) is proven. He lived a long age. His son Abū Mālik and Şafwān ibn Sulaym narrated from him. He has two dispatched narrations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tajrid_sahaba_1_69.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Tajrīd Asmā’ al-Şaĥāba</em>, of <u>Sh</u>ams al-Dīn al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 69 [Beirut]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What the Answering-Ansar team did is that they deceivingly left all these works behind and jumped to <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, while covering the act by lying that the author has mentioned the biographies of “all manner” of narrators in it. The truth, however, is different. It is a known fact that al-Dhahabī has not included all types of narrators in his <em>Mīzān</em>. In fact, <em>Mīzān</em> is a work on narrators whose reliability has been questioned and therefore he has not included many narrators in it, including the Companions of the Prophet (saws).</p>



<p>He explicitly states about the Companions (ra) in the introduction of the work:</p>



<p>ولا أذكرهم في هذا المصنف فإن الضعف إنما جاء من جهة الرواة إليهم وكذا لا أذكر في كتابي من الآئمة المتبوعين في الفروع أحدا لجلالتهم في الاسلام وعظمتهم في النفوس</p>



<p><strong>“I will <u>not mention</u> them in this compilation, for the weakness has come from the sub-narrators that are linked to them. Similarly, I will not mention any of the followed <em>Imāms</em> in this book, such as Abū Ĥanīfa, al-<u>Sh</u>āfi`ī and al-Bu<u>kh</u>arī due their majesty in Islam and essential greatness.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl fī Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 3 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The highly praised <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar al-Mīrzā Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339) also confirms this while criticizing both <em>Sunnīs</em> and al-Dhahabī:</p>



<p>هذا الذهبي على إمامته وجلالته عندهم تأنف من ذكر الصحابة في كتابه</p>



<p><strong>“This al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī, despite of his scholarly leadership and loftiness according to them, utterly detested the mention of the Companions in his book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Qawl al-Şurāĥ fī al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī wa Şaĥīĥih al-Jāmi`</em>, of Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339), page 42 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus, the reason why al-Dhahabī has not included Tha`laba (ra) in his <em>Mīzān</em> is because he is a Companion, as mentioned by him in <em>al-Tajrīd</em>, not because he is unknown, and Answering-Ansar’s claim that al-Dhahabī has included the “biographies of all manner” of narrators in it is yet another example of their dishonesty and misrepresentation of <em>Sunnī</em> texts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three – “Completely Unknown”?</h2>



<p>It has been shown above that the biography of Tha`laba (ra) has been mentioned in over a dozen <em>Sunnī</em> and <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts of narrator-biographies. If someone actually goes through other texts such as compilations of narrations, commentaries and genealogical works,&nbsp;there is no doubt that a lot more can be read about Tha`laba (ra).</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) writes in <em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>Th</u></strong><strong>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk:</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> [al-Ţūsī] has mentioned him among the Companions of the Messenger (saws). This is how the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> has named his father, ‘Abī Malīk.’ However, it is ‘ibn Abī Mālik’ in <em>al-Ţabaqāt</em>, <em>al-Istī`āb</em>, <em>Usd al-<u>Gh</u>āba</em>, <em>al-Işāba</em> and <em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Muĥammad ibn Sa`d said in <em>al-Ţabaqāt al-Kabīr</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh ibn Sām, and <u>Th</u>a`laba is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ Abī Mālik came from Yemen and said: ‘We are from the tribe of Kindah which is on the Jewish religion.’ He then married into the Ibn Sa`ya (family) of the Qurayža tribe and confederated with them; thus it was said: ‘the Quražī.’ He has narrated from `Umar and `U<u>th</u>mān. He used be given the cognomen of ‘Abū Ja`far.’ <u>Th</u>a`laba was <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža until he passed away. He was great and did not narrate many narrations.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in <em>al-Istī`āb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws). The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh, and he—meaning, <u>Th</u>a`laba—is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá’ from Kindah. His father came from Yemen, on the Jewish religion. He was accommodated by the Qurayža tribe and thus he is ascribed to them. He was not one of them, so he accepted Islam. He narrated from `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān and all the Companions.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in </strong><strong><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ His vision (of the Prophet) is proven</strong><strong>. He narrated from the Prophet (saws), `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān, Jābir, Ĥāritha ibn al-Nu`mān and a large group. His two sons Abū Mālik and Manžūr, al-Zuhrī, al-Miswar ibn Rifā`a, Muĥammad ibn `Uqba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, Şafwān ibn Sulaym and others narrated from him. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī said: ‘He was great,&nbsp;<em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža and&nbsp;on the Jewish religion. He married a woman from the tribe of Qurayža and thus he was ascribed to them, while he was (originally) from Kindah. Tha`laba used to lead the tribe of Qurayža in his youth. Abū Ĥātim said: ‘He is from the predecessors.’ al-`Ijlī said: ‘A trustworthy predecessor.’ And Ibn Ĥibbān mentioned him in <em>al-<u>Th</u>iqāt</em> [“The Trustworthy Narrators”].’</strong><strong>’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is not known whether he falls under the condition of our book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn (d. 1371), volume 4, page 22 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up all of the aforementioned information about Tha`laba (ra) present in <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, it is known that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His ancestors were from Yemen.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and lived a long life.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a Companion of the Prophet (saws).</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His cognomen was Abū Mālik—others also said Abū Yaĥyá.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a confederate of the Anşār.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He narrated from `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb, `Uthmān ibn `Affān (ra), and others.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His sons, al-Zuhrī, and others narrated from him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was the <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe until his demise.</li>
</ul>



<p>In spite of this information that is spread throughout innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, the Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is “a completely unknown personality.”</p>



<p>Can this be called anything but outright lying?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>It has been evidently shown that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is not an unknown or unreliable narrator, rather a Companion of the Prophet (saws) whose biography is present in innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, and particularly the texts of <em>rijāl</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to explicitly say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Once again, it has been shown how Answering-Ansar chooses deceptive methods of argumentation by blatantly lying about narrators and Islamic texts for the sole reason of denying a narration that goes against their view.</p>



<p><strong>Is this what the Answering-Ansar team means by their motto, “Revealing the Truth”?</strong></p>



<p>We will let the readers decide.</p>



<p>As for the “Undh” absurdity, that has been covered in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the earlier expositions</a>.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Our 20 questions&#8230; (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em> are known to misinterpret, misquote and distort texts in order to defame Mu`āwiya (ra), the Companion of the Prophet (saws). Answering-Ansar has also marked its effort in this regard by brazenly&nbsp;lying about&nbsp;<em>Tārī<u>kh</u>-i Islām</em> of Akbar Shāh al-Najībābādī (d. 1357).</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>17.</strong> If failing to believe in Hadhrath Ayesha is an act of Kufr what opinion should we hold with regards to her killer?<br><em><u>Hadhrath Ayesha was killed by Mu&#8217;awiya</u> (Tarikh al Islam, by Najeeb Abadi, Vol 2 p 44)</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216090954/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/20_questions_5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216090954/http://www.answering-ansar.org/challenges/20questions/en/index.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Our 20 questions&#8230;</em>, page 5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The claim and the text referenced are obvious to the readers.</p>



<p>By posing this question, the Answering-Ansar team is suggesting that the Companion Mu`āwiya (ra) should be condemned because he murdered the Mother of the Believers, `Ā’isha bint Abī Bakr (ra), and this is proven from al-Najībābādī’s <em>Tārī<u>kh</u>-i Islām</em>. It is also worthy to note that the exact page and volume is mentioned as well, implying that the reference is verified.</p>



<p>Now, let us see what al-Najībābādī has really written:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Real Words of al-Najībābādī</h2>



<p>What al-Najībābādī has actually written about the death of `Ā’isha (ra) is:</p>



<p>سنہ ٥٨ھ میں حضرت ام المومنین حضرت عائشہ صدیقہ رضی ﷲ عنہا فوت ہو کر البقیع میں مدفون ہوئیں آپ مروان کی مخالفت کیا کرتی تہیں کیونکہ اس کے اعمال اچھے نہ تھے مروان نے ایک روز دھوکے سے دعوت کے بہانے سے بلا کر ایک گڑھے میں جس میں ننگی تلواریں اور خنجر وغیرہ رکھ دیۓ تھے آپ کو گرا دیا تھا آپ بہت ضعیف اور بوڑہی تھیں زخمی ہوئیں اور انہیں زخموں کے صدمہ سے فوت ہو گئیں</p>



<p><strong>“In 58 A.H., the respected Mother of the Believers `Ā’i<u>sh</u>a Şiddīqa (ra) passed away, and was buried in al-Baqī`. She used to oppose <u>Marwān</u> because his actions were not good. One day, <u>Marwān</u> deceitfully invited her for dinner as&nbsp;a pretense&nbsp;and threw her in a cavity, in which he had placed bare swords and daggers. She was very elderly and weak, became wounded and passed away due to the concussion caused by the wounds.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216090954/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tarikh_najibabadi_2_42.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Tārī<u>kh</u>-i Islām (Urdu)</em>, of Akbar <u>Sh</u>āh al-Najībābādī (d. 1357), volume 2, page 42 [Lahore]</a></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Subĥān Allāh</em>.</p>



<p>The quote above is crystal-clear.</p>



<p>There is absolutely <strong>no</strong> mention of Mu`āwiya (ra) in what al-Najībābādī&nbsp;relates about the demise of `Ā’isha (ra). Instead, he&nbsp;relates—without any proof—that it was Marwān ibn al-Ĥakam,&nbsp;someone not&nbsp;even regarded as&nbsp;a Companion of the Prophet (saws)&nbsp;by the&nbsp;<em>Sunnīs</em>, who allegedly murdered her.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar’s lie is evident and requires no explanation.</p>



<p>May Allāh (swt) protect all unbiased Muslims from such deception.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><strong>The Narration “Ali is Siddiq Akbar”</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Analysis of the chain and text of the alleged statement of &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and refutation of the arguments made to authenticate it.</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>By</em></strong><br><strong><em>Abu Sumayyah Moin</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام علي رسوله الأمين</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This article is to discuss the status of the narration which says that ‘Ali b. Abi Talib said, “I am <em>As-Siddiq al-Akbar</em> [the greatest Siddiq].”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Was ‘Ali ever referred to as “<em>As-Siddiq al-Akbar”</em>?</strong></h4>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The simple answer is No. If ‘Ali had ever called himself a Siddiq then this would have been a famous title among his companions and early followers. However, this was not the case and it only came to screen after people started referring to Abu Bakr as a Siddiq.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This narration with this wording comes as a statement of ‘Ali, which is more famous, and also as a saying of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam). The Marfu’ version is different and it did not get enough fame.&nbsp; The Marfu’ version is only restricted to Hadith collections which are well known for including all kind of weak and fabricated narrations along with authentic ones. However, the Mawquf tradition, which is a statement of ‘Ali, made its way into the Sunan of Ibn Majah, which is sixth of the six major Hadith collection, and Fadail as-Sahaba of Imam Ahmad even though he excluded it from Musnad as he considered it a Munkar narration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I will only touch the alleged statement of ‘Ali as it is the most widely used on this topic. The Marfu’ narrations are not that famous and weaknesses in these narrations are very obvious to any person who has even slightly smelled the fragrance of this ‘Ilm.</p>



<p>&nbsp;‘Ali b. Abi Talib (ra) allegedly uttered it on the pulpit in the Masjid of Basrah. It has been narrated through two different routes both of which are severely weak due to its chain and also text. This article is split into two sections:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Discussion on the Sanad of this narration</li><li>Discussion on its text (Matan).</li></ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Section-1: Analyzing the chains of the narration</strong></h4>



<p>This narration has reached us with two different chains. Both are different chains but they are describing the same incident.</p>



<p><strong>First Chain: ‘Abbad b. ‘Abdullah narrating from ‘Ali (ra)</strong></p>



<p>It has been narrated through Minhal bin ‘Amr from ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah that ‘Ali bin Abi Talib said:</p>



<p>أَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ وَأَخُو رَسُولِهِ وَأَنَا الصِّدِّيقُ الْأَكْبَرُ , لَا يَقُولُهَا بَعْدِي إِلَّا كَذَّابٌ مُفْتَرٍ , وَلَقَدْ صَلَّيْتُ قَبْلَ النَّاسِ بِسَبْعِ سِنِينَ</p>



<p>“I am servant of Allah and the brother of the Messenger of Allah. I am “As-Siddiq Al-Akbar”, no one will say it after me except a liar and a slanderer. I prayed seven years before people.” [Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaiba (32084), Fadail as-Sahaba by Ahmad (993), Sunan Ibn Majah (120), As-Sunah al-Kubra by Nasai (8338), As-Sunnah by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim (1324), Al-Mustadrak by Al-Hakim (4584)]</p>



<p>This narration is Munkar and rejected due to its Sanad and Matan. The text of the narration will be discussed at the end along with the scholarly verdicts on this narration.</p>



<p><strong><em>Narrator: ‘Abbad b. Abdullah al-Kufi</em></strong></p>



<p>The problem in this chain is the narrator ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah al-Kufi. Imam ‘Ali b. Al-Madini said regarding him:</p>



<p>“He is weak in narrations.” [Al-Mawdu’aat by Ibn al-Jawzi (1/341), Meezan al-I’itidal (2/368) Tahdhib at-Tahdhib (5/98)]</p>



<p>Al-Bukhari said regarding him:</p>



<p>“There is problem in him [Feehi nazar].” [At-Tarikh al-Kabeer (6/33), Meezan al-I’itidal]</p>



<p>Ibn ‘Adi quoted the criticism of al-Bukhari with affirmation. [Al-Kamil (5/553)]</p>



<p>Similarly, al-‘Uqaili and Ibn Jarud included ‘Abbad among weak narrators. [Al-Du’afa (3/137) by al-‘Uqaili, Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal (7/177)]</p>



<p>That is why Al-Dhahabi concluded and said, ‘They abandoned him’, and Ibn Hajar said that he was weak. [Al-Kashif (2569), Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.3136)]</p>



<p>This is besides the fact that Ibn Hibban and Al-‘Ijli included this narrator among the Thiqaat. But still Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajar did not give weight to their Tawthiq and declared ‘Abbad to be untrustworthy. [See Tawthiq of Ibn Hibban in Thiqat (5/141) and that of al-‘Ijli in his Thiqaat (2/17)]</p>



<p>However, some people still managed declaring ‘Abbad to be Thiqah. The points made to defend this narrator are as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The statement of Bukhari is not a severe criticism.</li><li>Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any praise or criticism against him therefore this necessitates Ta’deel.</li><li>Al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban both declared him Thiqah.</li><li>The criticism against him is unexplained therefore praise must be preferred.</li></ol>



<p>Let us discuss all these arguments one by one.</p>



<p><strong><em>The statement of Bukhari “Feehi nazar”</em></strong></p>



<p>Imam Bukhari was well known for not using harsh words while criticizing a narrator. Hence, we see him often criticize a narrator with terms like “feehi nazar”, “Sakatu ‘anhu” [They stayed silent on him] and “Munkar al-Hadith”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vast majority of scholars feel that the term “Feehi nazar” indicates severe criticism from the perspective of Imam Bukhari. These scholars include Hafiz Dhahabi, Al-‘Iraqi, As-Suyuti, Ibn Katheer and As-Sakhawi. On the other hand there are some contemporaries who held that it may or may not mean severe criticism but they all agree that this term is used for weak narrators.</p>



<p>‘Abdul Hayy al-Lukhnawi says in “Ar-Rafa’ wa at-Takmil” (p.388):</p>



<p>قوا البُخَارِيّ فِي حق اُحْدُ من الروَاة فِيهِ نظر يدل على انه مُتَّهم عِنْده وَلَا كَذَلِك عِنْد غَيره</p>



<p>قَالَ الذَّهَبِيّ فِي مِيزَانه فِي تَرْجَمَة عبد الله بن دَاوُد الوَاسِطِيّ قَالَ البُخَارِيّ فِيهِ نظر وَلَا يَقُول هَذَا الا فِيمَن يتهمه غَالِبا</p>



<p>“The statement of Bukhari “<em>Feehi Nazar</em>” regarding a narrator shows that he is an accused narrator according to him. But this is not with other scholars. Al-Dhahabi says in Meezan in the entry of ‘Abdullah bin Dawud al-Wasiti: Bukhari says “Feehi nazar” and he does not say this, most of the times, except with those narrators whom he accuses…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hafiz al-Mizzi, in the entry of the narrator ‘Abdul Karim bin Abil Makhariq, quotes Hafiz Abu Muhammad Al-Ishbili who said:</p>



<p>لأنه قد قال في &#8220;التاريخ&#8221;: كل من لم أبين فيه جرحه فهو على الاحتمال، وإذا قلت: فيه نظر، فلا يحتمل</p>



<p>“Imam Bukhari said in “Tarikh”: All narrators regarding whom I did not mention any criticism then they have the possibilities (to be accepted for consideration), and when I say “Feehi nazar” then there is no possibility (for his narration to be accepted).” [Tahdheeb al-Kamal (18/265)]</p>



<p>This statement indicates that all such narrators were not acceptable according to Imam Bukhari. This is also evident when we see that Al-Bukhari have included many well known narrators who had some weakness but he did not criticize them in his Tarikh. See for example: Isma’eel bin Rafi’ al-Madani, Ayyub b. Jabir Al-Yamami, ‘Abdullah b. Muslim b. Hurmuz, ‘Ali b. Zaid b. Jud’aan and many others. So it suggests us that Al-Bukhari felt to use this criticism only when the weakness of the narrator was severe according to him. Allah knows best.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>The “silence of Ibn Abi Hatim”</em></strong></p>



<p>Some scholars of recent time have claimed that the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim in the book “al-Jarh wa at-Ta’deel” is equivalent to praise [تعديل]. It was claimed by Shaykh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah where he was inspired by some Indian scholar. So according to these scholars if Ibn Abi Hatim listed a narrator in his book but did not mention Jarh then it would mean it is a “Ta’deel” from him. However, this is a very odd opinion and goes against vast majority of other scholars who were authority in this field. In fact this even goes against the apparent opinion of Ibn Abi Hatim himself. He says in Muqaddima of his book:&nbsp;</p>



<p>على أنا قد ذكرنا أسامي كثيرة مهملة من الجرح والتعديل كتبناها ليشتمل الكتاب على كل من روى عنه العلم رجاء وجود الجرح والتعديل فيهم فنحن ملحقوها بهم من بعد إن شاء الله تعالى</p>



<p>“And we have also mentioned narrators without any statement of criticism or praise so as to include everyone in this books from whom knowledge [Hadith] has been narrated while expecting the occurrence of praise or criticism [regarding them]. So we will add it later if Allah willed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is clear from this quote that Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any ruling on some narrators only because he was not aware of their status. So they were more like “Mastur” or “Majhul” according to him. But if any criticism or praise found regarding such narrators from other scholars then his silence carry no weight as it was based merely on the lack of information.</p>



<p>This was also the view of <em>Hafiz Ibn Hajar</em> with regards to the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. In fact if we compare his methodology in this regard with different narrators we see the ruling of Hafiz changes as per his evaluation of such narrators from declaring the narrators Mastur to calling them Majhul. But he never considered such a narrator to be Thiqah only based on the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. Hence he says in “Al-Nukat” (2/769) regardin Ibn ‘Abdullah b. Mughaffal:</p>



<p><strong>فقد ذكره البخاري في &#8220;تأريخه&#8221; فسماه: يزيد ولم يذكر فيه هو ولا ابن أبي حاتم جرحا، فهو مستور&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Bukhari has mentioned him in his Tareekh and named him Yazid. Neither he nor Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned any criticism against him. Therefore he is “Mastur”…”</p>



<p>On the other hand, he declared the narrator Shaqiq Abu Laith to be Majhul even though Ibn Abi Hatim listed him in his book without any Jarh or Ta’deel, and no other scholars made criticism against him.&nbsp; [See his entry in “Taqrib at-Tahdhib]</p>



<p>Some people claim that Ibn Hajar was of the opinion that silence of Ibn Abi Hatim in his book amounts to Ta’deel. Here are some of the examples which are generally brought to make this claim along with our response to it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Hasan b. Mudrik al-As-Sadusi: Abu Dawud, in the report of Abu ‘Ubaid al-Aajurri, said that he was a liar. Hafiz Ibn Hajar responded by saying that Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah wrote narrations from him but did not point out any criticism against him. [Fath al-Bari (1/397, Muqaddimah). So they say that since Ibn Hajar rejected Abu Dawud’s criticism based on the silence of Abu Zur’ah and Abu Hatim therefore he deemed their silence to be Ta’deel. However this is not the case. If we go back to the reference, we find that Ibn Hajar in fact refuted the Jarh by showing the cause of Jarh is not valid. Along with that he mentioned Nasai who said regarding Hasan that there is no problem in him (لا بأس به). Ibn ‘Adi said he was from the Huffaz of Basrah. Besides that he was from the Shuyukh of Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah and they were known for avoiding abandoned narrators. All these facts made Ibn Hajar to reject the criticism of Abu Dawud.</li><li>Iyas b. ‘Afeef: Bukhari said regarding him, “Feehi Nazar”. Hafiz Ibn Hajar added after the comment of Bukhari that Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him in his book but did not mention any criticism. [Lisan (2/232)]. So these people assumed that Ibn Hajar is rejecting the criticism of Bukhari by mentioning the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. However, Ibn Hajar did not say any such thing. Through out of his book Lisan al-Meezan he has the habit of quoting Ibn Abi Hatim along with this comment if no Jarh or Ta’deel is found in his book. In fact after few pages (2/234) of the same book Hafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned a narrator Ayman. He declared him Majhul even though he also mentioned the same thing regarding him that Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any criticism regarding him. This makes his methodology even more clear.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><em>Hafiz Ibn Katheer </em>also deemed such narrators to be Mastur. He said regarding a narrator Musa bin Jubair in his Tafseer [al-Baqarah 2:102]:</p>



<p><strong>وَذَكَرَهُ ابْنُ أَبِي حَاتِمٍ فِي كِتَابِ الْجَرْحِ وَالتَّعْدِيلِ، وَلَمْ يحك فيه شيئًامِنْ هَذَا وَلَا هَذَا، فَهُوَ مَسْتُورُ الْحَالِ</strong></p>



<p>“And Ibn Abi Hatim has mentioned him in his book ‘Al-Jarh wa al-Ta’deel’ and did not report either of the verdicts regarding him, therefore he is Mastur al-Haal…”</p>



<p>Hafiz Dhahabi was even more to the point and he would call a narrator Majhul only based on the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim about the narrator as long as there is no other praise available in his favour. Same was the view of Hafiz Ibn Qattan. So we see there is hardly any Hadith specialist in past that held such views and even worse this view goes against Ibn Abi Hatim’s own comment.</p>



<p><em>After all this it should also be clear that this debate is only about those narrators who were neither criticized nor praised by any other Imam of this field</em>. If there is any criticism or praise available on such narrators then the discussion of silence is not applicable in the first place like in the case of ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah. Therefore, those people who try to elevate ‘Abbad to the level of reliability are wrong in both of these conditions.</p>



<p><strong><em>The praise from al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban</em></strong></p>



<p>The dispute regarding the leniency of al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban are well known among scholars of Hadith. While the leniency of Ibn Hibban was well knows since he himself explained it, however this was not the case with Al-‘Ijli as he did not explained his methodology. Al-Mu’allimi was the one who argued first that al-‘Ijli was lenient in this regard. The leniency of al-‘Ijli has been claimed on the following issues:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>His Tawthiq of several narrators who were Majhul. In this he was said to have on the same methodology as of Ibn Hibban.</li><li>His Tawthiq of narrators who were widely criticized by other scholars.</li></ol>



<p>Later shaykh Albani also held this view and people then widely followed their view as they found it closer to reality. Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Aleem Bastawi, who edited and published the book of Al-‘Ijli, also concluded that he had methodology similar to Ibn Hibban in strengthening unknown and those narrators regarding whom they did not receive any criticism. Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Aleem mentioned several examples of such narrators.</p>



<p>In this case, the Tawthiq of Ibn Hibban and Al-‘Ijli for the narrator ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah is rejected not only because they were lenient in their methodology but also due to the fact that their views here contradict majority of experts of this field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Abbad basically is from the narrators who would generally be considered unknown. If we look at the entries of ‘Abbad in different books we can easily conclude:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Only Minhal bin ‘Amr narrate from him.</li><li>He has very few narrations.</li><li>Nothing is known about him except his name and where he lived.</li></ol>



<p>So he was a real fit to be called a Majhul narrator, and hence they were acceptable as per the methodology of al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban since they did not come across criticism against him nor they saw a Munkar tradition of ‘Abbad. But this unknown narrator was further degraded to the level of unreliable narrators due to the comment of Imam Bukhari, Ibn al-Madini, Ibn ‘Adi and others. Therefore, it is illogical to rely on the views of these two instead of those who criticized ‘Abbad especially when we see most of ‘Abbad’s narrations are Munkar and not similar to the narrations of Thiqaat.</p>



<p><strong><em>Comparison between praise and criticism</em></strong></p>



<p>Those who criticized ‘Abbad b. Abdullah are: [1] ‘Ali b. Madini [2] Al-Bukhari [3] Abu Ja’far al-‘Uqaili [4] Ibn ‘Adi. Those who declared his to be Thiqah are: [1] Al-‘Ijli [2] Ibn Hibban.</p>



<p>Since, we have already seen that the Tawthiq of Al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban are based on a methodology which was specific to these two scholars and not acceptable to other scholars of Hadith hence the principle of preferring praise over unexplained Jarh is not applicable in this case. Tawthiq is preferred when there are no other deciding factors and the reconciliation is difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Second Chain: Sulaiman b. ‘Abdullah narrating from Mu’adha al-‘Adawiyyah</strong></p>



<p>Another chain comes through Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah from Mu’adhah Al-‘Adawiyyah that she heard ‘Ali bin Abi Talib stating on the pulpit of Basra:</p>



<p>“I am Al-Siddiq al-Akbar. I believed before Abu Bakr believed and I accepted Islam before him.” [Al-Tarikh al-Kabir of Bukhari, Al-Aahaad wa al-Mathaani by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim (186-187), Al-Kuna by Al-Dulabi (1587), Al-Du’afa by al-‘Uqaili (2/130)]</p>



<p>Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah in this chain is Majhool. Al-Bukhari states regarding this report of Sulaiman:</p>



<p>لا يتابع عليه ولا يعرف سماغ سُلَيْمَان من معَاذة</p>



<p>“No one supports him on this and hearing of Sulaiman from Mu’adhah is not known.”&nbsp; [At-Tarikh al-Kabir (4/23)]</p>



<p>Ibn ‘Adi agreed with Al-Bukhari and said:</p>



<p>وسليمان يعرف بهذا الحديث، ولاَ أعرف له غيره ولم يتابع على هذه الرواية كما قاله البخاري</p>



<p>“Sulaiman is known through this narration (only) and I do not know any of his hadith other than this. No one supports him on this as stated by Al-Bukhari.” [Al-Kamil (4/268)]</p>



<p>Al-Dhahabi said in “Meezan” (2/212):</p>



<p>قال البخاري: لا يتابع عليه وذكره ابن عدي في الضعفاء</p>



<p>“Bukhari said, ‘No one backs his narration.’ Ibn ‘Adi mentioned him among weak narrators.”</p>



<p>So an unknown narrator narrating his only narration, which is criticized by scholars, is nothing less than a severe criticism against him.</p>



<p>Hence, Sulaiman b. ‘Abdullah was an unknown narrator. Still Ibn Hibban included him among Thiqaat due to his faulty methodology regarding such narrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>What makes a narrator Majhul?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Before I discuss this, let me make it clear again that the narrator had criticism in his favor. He had only one narration and that too was criticized by experts like Bukhari and Ibn ‘Adi. Besides that al-‘Uqaili included this narrator in book on weak narrators “Ad-Du’afa”.</em></p>



<p>A Majhul or unknown narrator is that who was not famous in field of knowledge. Later, scholars divided such narrators into different categories:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Majhul al-‘Ayn: The narrator through whom only one has person narrated and no one declared him reliable nor was he criticized.</li><li>Majhul al-Haal or Mastur: These are the narrators from whom more than one trustworthy people have taken Hadith but he was neither praised nor criticized.</li></ol>



<p>There had been a dispute among scholars of Hadith regarding the acceptance of the hadith of a Majhul al-Haal narrator. It has been accepted by some scholars like Ibn Khuzaimah and his student Ibn Hibban. However, majority of scholars do not accept it except in cases where there are other factors which indicate towards the reliability of such narrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the narrator we are discussing currently do not fit in any side of the disputed group. The narrator Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah is Majhul al-‘Ayn not Mastur since only Nuh bin Qais narrates from him as pointed out by Imam Bukhari and affirmed by Ibn ‘Adi in “al-Kamil”.</p>



<p>Al-Baladhuri brought another chain of this narration in his “Ansab al-Ashraf” (2/147) where another narrator is narrating this from Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah. Some of the innovators may use this to raise Sulaiman to the level of Mastur or Majhul al-Haal and hence making it acceptable based on the standard of some scholars. However, it is to be noted that Al-Baladhuri is a historian whose book was not served as other hadith works are served. Hence, we find several odd narrations in that book which were not known to specialists of Hadith. Even Al-Baladhuri himself was not analyzed as a narrator and hence it is hard to find any praise for him as a narrator. Since, several Hadith specialists did not acknowledge any such alternate chain for this narration or another student of Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah therefore it is very much unlikely that Al-Baladhuri would have preserved it properly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, if we assume that the chain, which actually is a shaadh chain, has been preserved by Al-Baladhuri precisely then also it is not sufficient to raise Sulaiman to the level of Mastur. This is because the narrator here is Abu Hilal Ar-Rasibi who was a disputed narrator. While to raise a narrator from the status of Majhul al-‘Ayn at least two well known people famous for their knowledge must narrate from him. It is as described by Khateeb in “Al-Kifayah” [p.88]:</p>



<p><strong>وَأَقَلُّ مَا تَرْتَفِعُ بِهِ الْجَهَالَةُ أَنْ يَرْوِيَ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ اثْنَانِ فَصَاعِدًا مِنَ الْمَشْهُورِينَ بِالْعِلْمِ كَذَلِكَ</strong></p>



<p>“The least which raises a narrator from the level of Majhul [al-‘Ayn] is when two or more people who were well known for their knowledge narrate from him.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Does this supports the earlier chain?</em></strong></p>



<p>The simple answer to this question is No. This is because the Mutabi’ah or corroboration is only considered for those narrators whose weakness is due to their weak memory, Ikhtilat and others issues related to memory where chances of errors due to forgetfulness could be ignored if both the narrators testify the same thing. However, when a narrator’s weakness is due to his habit of lying or due to severe deterioration of the memory, or if there is lack of information about the narrator then such narrators cannot be aided by a weak narrator or another narrator of his kind. And if such narrators narrate something which has the text that is not supported by the narrations of other trustworthy narrators, then such narrations could be declared forged or falsehood as we shall see in next heading.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Section-2: Analyzing the text of the narration</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>The Narration is Munkar:</em></strong></p>



<p>As we have seen defects in the chains of these narrations, let us have a look at the text of the narration. In the narration above we can see ‘Ali b. Abi Talib calling himself the Siddiq Akbar and accusing anyone of lying who would claim to be as such after him. In the other version we even see him comparing himself with Abu Bakr and preferring himself over him. All this is against the well known characteristics of ‘Ali (ra). In this section I will enlist reasons for the Nakarah in this narration:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The first reason for the narration being Munkar is that it has been reported through chains which are not well-know chains of knowledge. In the first chain, the narrator ‘Abbad is not well known for being a companion of ‘Ali (ra). This whole chain is isolated. Similarly in the second chain an unknown person is claiming to have heard something from a Sahabiyyah which no one else ever claimed to have heard from her. The valid question here is where were all the well known Shuyukh and Rijal of Hadith when this statement was uttered on Minbar of Basra? Why this merit could not be reported by even reliable Shi’i narrators?</li><li>The second reason is the fact that the term “Siddiq Akbar” or even “Siddiq” was never known for ‘Ali. In history he was never known with this title. This is unlike Abu Bakr who was ofter referred to as a Siddiq in Hadith and History books. If there was an authentic origin of this and ‘Ali ever announced it on pulpit for himself then it would have been a common attribute of Ali and at least companions of ‘Ali would have referred him as such.&nbsp;</li><li>‘Ali was a humble person. He was never known for boasting about his own virtue unless if it was a necessity. He even never preferred himself over ‘Uthman. How come then he became so convinced of his loftiness that he started propagating his virtue through the Minbar denying it for anyone else, as if this attribute was revealed from Allah for him only.</li><li>In the first route of the narration ‘Ali reportedly said that he prayed seven years before anyone else had prayed. This is clearly a false statement. Ibn Katheer took it as evidence against the authenticity of the narration. [Al-Bidayah (4/64)]</li></ol>



<p>All these points prove that the narration is not reliable and that is why Imam Ahmad said about it:</p>



<p>“Throw it away, for it is a Munkar narration.”</p>



<p>[Al-Muntakhab min ‘Ilal al-Khallal (114) by Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mawdu’aat (1/341) by Ibn al-Jawzi]</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h4>



<p>After looking at all these points it will be clear to anyone that this narration is not acceptable. Not just the narrators in its chains are unreliable even the content of the narration is problematic. This is the reason we see that several scholars, who came across it, rejected it. Scholars who declared this narration unreliable are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Imam Ahmad said regarding this, “Throw it away for it is a Munkar Hadith.” [Al-Muntakhab min ‘Ilal al-Khallal (p.204), Al-Mawdu’aat (1/341)]</li><li>Ibn al-Jawzi al-Hanbali declared it fabricated. [Al-Mawda’aat (1/341)]</li><li>Ibn al-Jawraqani declared it falsehood (Baatil). [Al-Abateel wa al-Manakeer (1/294)]</li><li>Ibn Taymiyyah declared it fabricated. [Minhaj as-Sunnah (7/443)]</li><li>Al-Dhahabi said, “It is lie on ‘Ali.” [Meezan (2/368)]</li><li>Ibn Katheer said, “This narration is Munkar…” [Al-Bidayah (4/64)]</li></ol>



<p>Finally, with all these scholarly opinions and by looking at all the evidences discussed in this article we can easily say that this narration is Munkar or falsehood with this text. If this had been a proven virtue of ‘Ali then this would have been famous in circles of ‘Ilm and ‘Ali would have been referred as a Siddiq by his companions and early followers before the origin of extremist sects of Imamiyyah. People would have rushed to such narrators only to hear this unique narration. The lack of all this factors proves the defects in this narration.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: </p>



<p>This paper evaluates the historical authenticity of a prominent ḥadīth that is regularly cited amidst Sunnī-Shi&#8217;ite polemical discussions, the long ḥadīth of Abū Balj regarding`Alī&#8217;s merits. The significance of this Prophetic tradition stems from several clauses within it that are perceived to be aligned with Shi&#8217;ite theology and relevant to debates on the successorship of the Prophet. A careful study of this tradition, however, will demonstrate the presence of various defects in its transmission that ultimately undermine and dispel its historical authenticity.</p>

<p>Ḥadīth al-Thaqalayn is a renowned Prophetic tradition that has been classically and controversially cited and debated in Sunnī-Shī&#8217;ite polemics and early <em>Uṣūlī </em>works. A challenge that faces many of the appeals and discussions that revolve around this report is the fact that many inauthentic variants for the report exist, which are of varying theological and historical implications. </p>



<p>This study thus attempts to piece together the different variants of the report in Sunnī literature, and it then ascertains the most authentic of them all. After that, it assesses the authentic report(s) along with their implications, further contextualizing them with other reports, events and relevant historical details.</p>

<p>Farīd Al-Bahraini (@farid_0v)</p>



<p>Bismillāh Al-Raḥmān Al-Raḥīm,</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>After the first generation of splits in the early Shia
community, an important ground rule was set up in order to constrict the
potential candidates for the Imamate. One of these conditions is that the
Imamate is exclusive to the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn, which led to the elimination
of Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥanafiyyah, the progeny of Al-Ḥassan, and other Hashimites
from the station of Imam. It was also quite useful for putting an end to those
irritating lesser known non-Hashimites like `Abdullāh bin `Amr bin Ḥarb
Al-Kindī,<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
who sought after the Imamate.</p>



<p>However, by the middle of the second century, pressure by other Shia sects increased, which may have looked something similar to what has been attributed to `Abdullāh bin Al-Ḥasan: “Why would it be in the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn when both are the leaders of the youth of paradise and are equal in merit, except for that Al-Ḥassan precedes Al-Ḥusayn in age, and the Imamate is supposed to be assigned to he who is superior?”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>While the concept of the superiority of Al-Ḥassan over Al-Ḥusayn
may seem foreign to most Shias today, this was the view of the early Shias as
recorded by Al-Karājikī<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
and is also supported by a report by that was attributed to Ja’far Al-Ṣādiq.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>



<p>Due to these circumstances, those that held the belief that the Imamate is restricted to the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn required a justification for themselves and for their opponents. The height of this perhaps occurred in the second century during the times of Al-Bāqir and Al-Ṣādiq. This is obvious when realizing that Ibn Bābawayh Al-Qummī, in his `Ilal Al-Sharā`i`i, has a full chapter, with twelve narrations, entitled: The reason as to why the Imamate is in the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn and not the progeny of Al-Ḥassan.</p>



<p>The first nine reports in this key chapter offer nothing
more than an affirmation of the criterion. The last three narrations provide
more direct answers:</p>



<p>Narration #10 states, “Allah is not asked about His actions.” This would be sufficient to believers in the constriction, but it was most likely not satisfying to opponents. </p>



<p>Narration #11 provides a very spiritualistic interpretation
that involves Moḥammad (peace be upon him) and Ali being created as a pillar of
light, which split from within Abdul-Muṭṭalib, into `Abdullāh and Abū Ṭālib,
then to Āmina bint Wahb and Fāṭima bint Asad. Then Āmina gave birth to the Prophet
(peace be upon him) and Fāṭima gave birth to `Alī. Ultimately, the report ends
with the explanation that Al-Ḥassan came from the light of `Alī and Al-Ḥusayn
came from the light of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which led to the
Imamate being transferred within the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn alone. The report
comes through the path of Ibn `Ulayya, from
Aslam bin Maysara Al-`Ijlī, from Anas bin Mālik, from Mu`aḏ bin Jabal. This
report does not go through Ahlulbayt, but through Sunni narrators, apparently
in order to provide it more legitimacy. They could argue that Shias themselves
should not dispute the matter of the exclusivity for even the Sunnis are aware
of this matter and narrate it.</p>



<p>Narration #12 includes
a polemical response instead of an answer where Al-Rabī’ bin `Abdillāh argues
that the line of prophets came through the path of Hārūn instead of Mūsā even
though Mūsā was superior to Hārūn. Al-Ṣādiq praises Al-Rabī’ for his sound
reasoning.</p>



<p>In total, none of the
reports in the chapter provide a clear-cut answer, with the exception of
narration #11, which is a clear fabrication.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>A Clear
Justification</strong></p>



<p>Strangely enough,
there is one report that Ibn Bābawayh did not include in his chapter, but can
be found in early sources. Not surprisingly, the report comes in forms that are
quite controversial and contradict what is seen as established Shia ideologies.</p>



<p>The report, which
comes in the form of a dispute between Zayn Al-`Ābidīn and his uncle Moḥammad
bin Al-Ḥanafiyyah on which of them is supposed to be the Imam. Their dispute is
settled by the black stone which testified that Zayn Al-`Ābidīn is the true
successor.</p>



<p>The narration can be
found in Baṣā`ir Al-Darajāt,<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
Mukhtaṣar Baṣā`ir Al-Darajāt,<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
Al-Kāfī,<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>
Al-Imāma wal Al-Tabṣira,<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>
and Dalā`il Al-Imāma.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
During the discussion, Zayn Al-`Ābidīn states that “You should not dispute this
matter, for I fear for you that your life may be shortened and the deterioration
of your condition. Allah the most majestic made the <em>wasiyyah</em> and the Imamate
in the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn (peace be onto him).” This is the wording provided
by Al-Kulaynī in Al-Kāfī. However, other sources provide a different wording.</p>



<p>In `Alī ibn Bābawayh’s
report, he includes the following instead: “When what occurred with Mu`āwiyah
happened, it had become apparent to Allah (بدا لله) the most majestic made
upon himself to not place the <em>wasiyyah</em> and Imamate anywhere but within
the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn (peace be onto him).”</p>



<p>The report in Mukhtaṣar
Baṣā`ir Al-Darajāt is even more explicit, for it states that “When [Al-Ḥassan
(peace be upon him) did what he did with Mu`āwiyah (may Allah curse him)],<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>
Allah the most majestic made upon himself to not place the <em>wasiyyah</em> and
Imamate anywhere but within the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn (peace be onto him).”</p>



<p>The report in Dalā`il
Al-Imāma is similar: “When Al-Ḥassan (peace be onto him) did with Mu`āwiyah
what he did, Allah the Almighty made the <em>wasiyyah</em> and Imamate in the
progeny of Al-Ḥusayn (peace be onto him).”</p>



<p>The report in Baṣā`ir
Al-Darajāt makes no mention of Al-Ḥassan nor does it mention limiting the
Imamate to the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn.</p>



<p><strong>Chains and Wordings</strong></p>



<p>The five reports above
all go through Al-Ḥassan bin Maḥbūb, from `Alī bin Ri`āb, from Abī `Ubayda and
Zurāra, from Abī Ja’far Al-Bāqir. Al-Kulaynī also provides a second path.</p>



<p>Baṣā`ir Al-Darajāt:
Al-Ṣaffār from Aḥmad bin Moḥammad and Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn from Al-Ḥassan bin
Maḥbūb.</p>



<p>Mukhtaṣar Baṣā`ir
Al-Darajāt: Sa`ad bin `Abdillāh Al-Qummī from Aḥmad and `Abdīllah bin Moḥammad
bin `Īsā both, from Al-Ḥassan bin Maḥbūb.</p>



<p>Al-Kāfī: Al-Kulaynī
from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Aḥmad bin Moḥammad, from Al-Ḥassan bin Maḥbūb. </p>



<p>Al-Kulaynī also
provides an alternative chain through `Alī bin Ibrāhīm from his father, from Ḥammād
bin `Īsā, from Ḥarīz, from Zurāra, from Abī Ja’far Al-Bāqir.</p>



<p>Al-Imāma wal Tabṣira: `Alī
ibn Babāwayh from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn bin Abī
Al-Khaṭṭāb, from Al-Ḥassan bin Maḥbūb.</p>



<p>Dalā`il Al-Imāma: The
author from Abī Al-Ḥassan `Alī bin Hibatillāh, from Abī Ja’far Moḥammad bin `Alī
bin Al-Ḥusayn bin Mūsā bin Babāwayh, from Al-Ḥusayn bin Sa`īd, from his father,
from Aḥmad bin Moḥammad bin `Īsā, from Al-Ḥassan bin Maḥbūb.</p>



<p>Three students of Al-Ḥassan
bin Maḥbūb have reported this narration from him. They are: Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn
bin Abī Al-Khaṭṭāb, Aḥmad bin Moḥammad bin `Īsā, and `Abdullāh bin Moḥammad bin
`Īsā.</p>



<p>The report of
`Abdillāh bin Moḥammad bin `Īsā includes the addition. While the narration has
been attributed to Aḥmad bin Moḥammad bin `Īsā and Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn bin
Abī Al-Khaṭṭāb with and without it.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Cause and Effect</strong></p>



<p>After years of civil
war, Al-Ḥassan and Mu`āwiyah agreed to end it in the year 41 AH. Al-Ḥassan gave
up his position and returned to Madinah in order to live out the rest of his
life away from politics. The companions of Al-Ḥassan became disillusioned with
him and switched out his title of “Commander of the Believers” with “the one
who has brought shame upon the believers.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>



<p>This act alone led Allah the Almighty, according to this report, to expel the children of Al-Ḥassan from the station of Imamate, and to keep it within the progeny of Al-Ḥusayn exclusively.</p>



<p><strong>According to later generations of Shias, Al-Ḥassan&#8217;s reconciliation with Mu`āwiyah conflicted with the policies of `Alī, but it was the correct decision, given the circumstances. On the other hand, some early Shias considered it to be an unjustifiable mistake.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, this view
was not a controversial one, due to the fact that early Shias, up until the
time of Hishām bin Al-Ḥakam, had no qualms with the belief that the Imams made
mistakes, for the concept of <a href="twelvershia.net/2017/12/25/infallibility-imams/">infallibility</a> was not
yet mainstream.</p>



<p>However, with the passage of time, some scholars, perhaps even Al-Kulaynī himself<strong>, </strong>found this report to be conflicting with their present ideology in the infallibility of the Imams, and thus, alterations needed to be made.</p>



<p>In conclusion, by
studying this report with a critical eye, an often overlooked tale about the
miraculous nature of the Imam told us more about the evolution of Shia thought
than we could have imagined.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">After publishing my work on the “Distortions of al-Ṣadūq”, I have received word of some responses that have been floating around the internet of partial refutations. After reading them, I only felt the urge to respond to one of the defenses of Ibn Bābawayh (or Ibn Bābūyah) aka al-Ṣadūq. The defense of this particular <em>ḥadīth</em> was written by Sh. Aḥmad Salmān, whom I consider an ideological opponent, but sincerely respect for his bright scholarly mind.</p>



<p>Before providing the response, I’ve shared the <em>ḥadīth</em>
in question, along with my argument, in order to provide the necessary
background.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">The Ḥadīth</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh reported: `Abdullah bin Jundub narrated<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
from Mūsā bin Ja`far (peace be onto him), he said: “You say in the prostration
of thankfulness: O’ Allah, I call you to witness and I call your angels,
prophets, messengers and all creation, that you Allah are my Lord, that Islam
is my religion, Muḥammad is my prophet, and that `Ali, al-Ḥasan, al-Ḥusayn, `Alī
bin al-Ḥusayn, Muḥammad bin `Alī, Ja`far bin Muḥammad, Mūsā bin Ja`far, `Alī
bin Mūsā, Muḥammad bin `Alī, `Alī bin Muḥammad, al-Ḥasan bin `Alī, and Allah’s
proof, the son of al-Ḥasan bin `Alī, are my Imams; I show loyalty for them and
disavow their enemies&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
</p>



<p>I say: Al-Kulaynī narrates it from `Alī bin Ibrāhīm, from his father, from `Abdillāh bin Jundub without any mention of the names of the Imams except for `Alī: “Muḥammad is my prophet and that `Alī and so-and-so are my Imāms.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">The Significance of this Manipulation</p>



<p>The difference between the two reports is clear. One report
explicitly mentions the names of all of the Imāms. The other report does not.
The argument I am making is that the original report has been tampered with in
order to justify the Shīa belief in all Twelve Imams.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh’s version conflicts with what the Twelver Shīa
deem authentic as reported by Ibn Abī Ya`fūr<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
as well as others, that the Imām of the age does not die before Allah reveals
to him the identity of the executioner of his will (i.e succeeding Imām). The
names of all Imāms were never known to them. In another authentic report<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
we find the Imām abstaining from informing his close companion Ismā`īl bin
Mihrān about the successor’s identity until the moment before his death. This
is another sign that the Shīa never knew the names of all Imāms, unlike what is
found in Ibn Bābawayh’s text. Furthermore, al-Kulaynī’s text is closer to the
historical reality, since it is known that the followers of the heads of the
prophetic household greatly differed in designating who their Imams were after
Mūsā al-Kāẓim.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Response by Sh. Aḥmad Salmān</p>



<p>Sh. Aḥmad Salmān, in response to the accusation, provides alternative possible explanations to deflect the accusation made against Ibn Bābawayh.</p>



<p>These explanations are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Al-Kulaynī summarized the
report and there are no additions.</li><li>The addition exists, but it
is acceptable since it came from a reliable transmitter.</li><li>The addition was actually a
commentary by Ibn Bābawayh.</li><li>There was a distortion, but
it was from Muḥammad bin `Alī Mājilūyah.</li></ul>



<p>The response provided by Sh. Aḥmad Salmān can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/PurifiedTruth/status/993453375822946305" rel="external nofollow">twitter</a>.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Possibility #1</p>



<p class="has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color">“The most that can be said is that the narration that Saduq narrated had additional text which Kulayni summarized and shortened, and when Saduq narrated the hadith he included the full original narration.”</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Response</strong></p>



<p>The claim mentioned is extremely unlikely, for two reasons:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>There are no motives for al-Kulaynī to shorten the report. Al-Kulaynī is very aware that the number of reports that list out all the Imāms are quite scarce, especially during his time. In the whole of Al-Kāfī, Al-Kulaynī only provides two reports that list all the names of the Imāms. Why would Al-Kulaynī sabotage this extremely important report that explicitly lists the names of all the Imams?</li><li>Ibn Bābawayh, on the other hand, had a very good reason to tamper with the report. The narration, in its original form, did not support Twelver doctrine more than it supported any of the tens of Shī’ī sects. However, after the alteration, it became one of the most explicit proofs for Twelverism. </li></ol>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Possibility #2</p>



<p class="has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color">“Differences regarding adding or leaving out text between narrations is well known and famous in the book [sic] of the sciences of hadith. It has been established by all scholars of this science that additional text that is narrated by trustworthy narrators, if the addition is not solitary (and out of place) or in opposition to other narrations, is accepted.”</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Response</strong></p>



<p>We are in agreement that there are cases in which additions can
be accepted. However, the report does not meet the conditions that are
required.</p>



<p>The statement made by Sh. Aḥmad is accurate only in cases
where the reliability of the narrator is a given. In other words, the analysis
done on the additions of a trustworthy narrator revolve around the report
itself, and whether it should be accepted or rejected. It has no bearing on the
actual transmitter, who remains reliable regardless of whether his addition is
accepted or rejected. </p>



<p>In this particular scenario, we are looking at a narrator that
has been accused of tampering with the text. In other words, this is not a case
where the rules of <em>ziyādat al-thiqa</em> (the additions of trustworthy
narrators) come into play. </p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Possibility #3</p>



<p class="has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color">“Even if we accept that this addition from Saduq is not
found in the original hadith, but rather, it is something he added, then this
would still be considered a non-issue, for it is an addition that is a tafseer
for the narration. We understand from the narration that it is recommended to
say the names of the Imams one by one during the supplication (dua). Saduq
simply made clear the narration and made clear what is to be said in the dua.”</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Response</strong></p>



<p>It is not reasonable to assume that such a matter can be
referred to as a mere <em>tafsīr</em>. Rather, the words in the original <em>ḥadīth</em>
were taken out and others were added in.</p>



<p>Note that the original <em>ḥadīth</em> states, “Muḥammad is my
prophet and that `Alī and so-and-so are my Imāms…”</p>



<p>If this were a mere <em>tafsīr</em>, Ibn Bābawayh would have reworded it as, “Muḥammad is my prophet and that `Alī <strong>and so-and-so are Imāms. Meaning:</strong> al-Ḥasan, al-Ḥusayn, `Alī bin al-Ḥusayn, Muḥammad bin `Alī, Ja`far bin Muḥammad, Mūsā bin Ja`far, `Alī bin Mūsā, Muḥammad bin `Alī, `Alī bin Muḥammad, al-Ḥasan bin `Alī, and Allah’s proof, the son of al-Ḥasan bin `Alī.”</p>



<p>However, instead, Ibn Bābawayh, removes the words,
“so-and-so,” and does not include the term, “meaning,” in order to express that
this is an interpretation. Commentaries do not require a replacement of text.</p>



<p>Moreover, these
actions by Ibn Bābawayh were not seen as a mere commentary by Shīa scholars. Rather, these words were taken as
the words of Mūsā bin Ja`far verbatim. One example of this is the Grand
Ayatollah Jawād Al-Tabrīzī, who in his treatise of authentic reports of the
appointment of the Imāms, only found two examples of “authentic” narrations that
listed the names of the Imāms in full. One of these two reports was this
narration by Ibn Bābawayh.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Al-Tabrīzī cannot be blamed for this
mistake, for there is no indication in the report that this is a mere
commentary.</p>



<p>As for Sh. Aḥmad’s
excuse that “Saduq simply made clear the narration and made clear what
is to be said in the dua.” </p>



<p>I say: Do the Twelvers not know who the Twelve Imams were?
Couldn’t Ibn Bābawayh include their names after the narration instead of
replacing words within the narration? This action alone causes us to have
doubts in regards to the integrity of Ibn Bābawayh, and through his other seven
manipulations that have to do with naming the Imāms and specifying their
number, we become certain that this action was indeed intentional.</p>



<p>Sh. Aḥmad seems to be overlooking the fact that this
“commentary” has severe ideological consequences. Perhaps he would have been
more aware of this if the commentator was an Ismā’īlī, Wāqifī, or Faṭḥī, who
instead substituted the ambiguous “so-and-so” with his own preferred list of
Imāms.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Possibility #4</p>



<p class="has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color">“And if this person
who’s bringing the accusation rejects all this and still considers this
addition a distortion, then his accusation against Saduq is nothing more but an
assumption and conjecture, for it is very possible that the distorter (if for
the argument’s sake if we say there has taken place distortion [sic]) was other
than him. This is because Saduq did not take this hadith from Kulayni as the
accuser falsely imagined, but rather, he took this narration from another
person (Muhammad Ibn Ali Majulwayh).”</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Response</strong></p>



<p>This objection is the
only reasonable one that has been made and my answer is a simple one. There is
a pattern which leads us to dismissing the possibility that the manipulation
came from Muḥammad bin `Alī Mājilūyah.</p>



<p>Out of the forty
manipulated narrations that I have stumbled upon, only five of them come
through the path of Muḥammad bin `Alī Mājilūyah. These are reports #2, #11, #12, #25, #32. Even if we were to assume
that all of these five were manipulated by Muḥammad bin `Alī Mājilūyah, what are we going to do with the other reports?!</p>



<p>It is known that the methodology
of the scholars of <em>ḥadīth</em> is point to the biggest culprit in the chain.
If the chain consists of a liar, a weak narrator, and a reliable narrator, the ḥadīthist
will accuse the liar, even though it is possible that the weak narrator made a
mistake. If the liar wasn’t present, the ḥadīthist would accuse the weak
narrator, even though it is entirely possible as well that the reliable
narrator made a mistake.</p>



<p>With that being said, Ibn Bābawayh is the lowest common denominator who keeps ending up at the scene of the crime.  The only time that Muḥammad bin `Alī Mājilūyah is found at the scene is when Ibn Bābawayh is there with him. Therefore, it is likelier for Ibn Bābawayh to be the culprit in all of these cases than for there to be a different culprit in each case, while absolving Ibn Bābawayh. I have made this point very clear early on in “Distortions of al-Ṣadūq” (p. 15) and the chances of Ibn Bābawayh never manipulating a <em>ḥadīth</em> is astronomically low.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Distortions of al-Bukhārī?</strong></p>



<p>In an attempt to
deflect the accusation against Ibn Bābawayh, Sh. Aḥmad included an example of
an alternative wording found in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. By this, he is arguing that
if Ibn Bābawayh manipulated a report, then you should say the same about al-Bukhārī.</p>



<p>However, the accusation leveled against al-Bukhārī has no bearing on the accusation against Ibn Bābawayh. If al-Bukhārī was a dishonest manipulator of the narrations of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , then we would discard him in the same way we would discard any lying narrator.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I will
not be responding to this criticism in this article, but will have to leave it
for another article, in order to not detract from the original topic: the
reliability of Ibn Bābawayh.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Conclusion</p>



<p>Sh. Aḥmad’s excuses
for Ibn Bābawayh are not reasonable. Had it not been for the ideological
significance of these distortions or the sheer number of occurrences, it may
have been possible to dismiss these as innocent additions. Unfortunately for
Ibn Bābawayh, the sinister nature of this manipulation is obvious, even in this
isolated case, let alone when going through his track record of other
manipulations that I have collected in the book. </p>



<p>In the end, all we can do after presenting these proofs is to call onto Allah the Almighty, asking Him to guide Sh. Aḥmad towards His straight path.</p>

<p>In Sunni-Shia polemics, Sunnis and Shias often end up debating minute theological, historical and jurisprudential technicalities such that they often overlook the bigger picture. The implications of entire historical narratives are thus neglected as polemicists passionately debate specific details from those narratives. However, the question that must be asked is: how do such narratives, at the end of the day, depict the Prophet and Islam? In this article, we shall dissect Shia Islam from the neutral perspective of a non-Muslim bystander.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In a Nutshell:</h3>



<p>This article commences with a genuine inquiry from a non-Muslim bystander: &#8220;What is Shia Islam?&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to this question, we shall fairly outline and present the <u class="remove-format">Twelver Shi&#8217;ite narrative:</u></p>



<p>In the 7th century, Allah sent a Messenger from the tribe of Quraish to the people of Mecca and surrounding Pagan Arabs. The purpose of this Prophet was to invite the idolaters to monotheism and the worship of Allah alone. Thus, the Prophet faced persecution and resistance from the Pagans who viewed his faith as a threat to their institutions. </p>



<p>HOWEVER, this Prophet also preached that his family, out of all people, were superior to all of mankind.  He even claimed that his cousin, &#8216;Ali, was the best of all mankind after him. This Prophet even continuously asserted that only his cousin were to rule his subjects after his death, and on numerous occasions, he openly appointed his cousin, &#8216;Ali (out of all people), as a religious and political successor. </p>



<p>This prophet also regularly claimed that only twelve members <u class="remove-format">from his household </u>were to legitimately assume rulership of the community after him. Not only did this Prophet continuously assert that his household had exclusive rights to the political leadership of his subjects, but he also regularly asserted that his own family had exclusive religious authority over his religious community.</p>



<p>This Prophet received a book from God called the Quran. This book, as reported in various Twelver sources, was revealed in fourths. One fourth of it was in the merits of his own family, one fourth was in the blunders of his family&#8217;s enemies,  one fourth was in stories and parables and the last fourth pertained to religious rulings.</p>



<p>This Prophet even claimed that his daughter and her husband (his cousin) were infallible, and he similarly claimed that 11 of his descendants were infallible as well. He even ventured to claim that those individuals from his family had knowledge of the unseen, and control over the universe (a concept later coined as <em>Wilayah Takwiniyyah</em>). </p>



<p>This Prophet even claimed that the followers and supporters of his family would rest in Heaven and that opponents of his family would dwell in Hell.</p>



<p>After this Prophet&#8217;s death, his closest followers and disciples took part in a massive conspiracy that usurped rulership from his family, which they were expected to assume. Then, his disciples proceeded to murder his own daughter inside her house.  Then, this Prophet&#8217;s religion was hijacked (by his closest companions), and this hijacked/distorted version of Islam has prevailed in the Muslim community since then.</p>



<p>This is a brief summary of the Prophet&#8217;s life in light of Twelver theology. If someone were to claim that we have misrepresented Twelver theology in this article, then we challenge them to demonstrate how we have done so.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discussion</h3>



<p>It is evident that such a narrative, in reality, discredits the Prophet as a power-thirsty individual who ultimately sought power and status for his family. The fact that a fundamental tenant of his faith was <em>wilayah  </em>(loyalty) to his family merely demonstrates this reality. </p>



<p>Critics of Islam have often made this point, and the best response to this claim is to demonstrate the impartiality of the Prophet with regards to political rulership and succession! However, a narrative that presents the Prophet as an individual who continuously aimed to establish his family members as his political and religious successors is a narrative that directly implicates the Prophet in this context!</p>



<p>Thus, it would be understandable if a neutral non-Muslim bystander were to dismiss Islam and be repulsed by such a faith and historical figure. Perhaps this is why Twelver dawah efforts are mostly limited to Muslims, as the Twelver narrative is one that fundamentally discredits Islam in the eyes of a neutral bystander. The Twelver historical narrative can only be believed by someone who already has respect and reverence for the Prophet (i.e a Sunni Muslim or a non-Muslim who has interest in Islam&#8230;).  </p>



<p>Rarely does one find Twelvers inviting non-Muslims to Islam. When they do, the non-Muslim is not exposed to the entire Twelver narrative. Rather, the non-Muslim is presented with a general Islamic narrative that resembles Sunni Islam. The Shi&#8217;ite narrative is then gradually presented and &#8220;trickled down&#8221; to the clueless inquirer. </p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Our objections to the Twelver narrative are not limited to this particular appeal. Using the &#8220;hadith&#8221; tag on our website, one can evaluate a variety of our technical contentions to the defective historical narrative of the Shi&#8217;ite school.</p>



<p> It is about time that the implications of this baseless historical narrative are publicly questioned and dissected such that no one can fall prey to the various efforts that seek to normalize this distorted theology in the Muslim community. </p>



<p>And Allah is the Witness of Abu Al-Abbas.</p>

<p>A major tradition that is upheld in the Twelver tradition and regularly cited in Suni-Shia polemics is the famous hadith known as &#8220;Hadith Al-Safinah&#8221; (hadith of the ark). In this report, the Prophet is quoted saying: &#8220;My household is like the Ark of Noah: whoever embarks on it is saved, and whoever abandons it is doomed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Twelver polemicists usually cite this report from Sunni sources, where it is transmitted with blunderous isnads of no value. This made me interested in evaluating the status of this report in Twelver sources, and I findings confirm what I had initially expected:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>There is not a single authentic isnad for &#8220;Hadith Al-Safinah&#8221; in Twelver sources (according to Twelver standards.)</li><li>The weakness in most these isnads is severe, usually with more than four unknown/obscure transmitters in each of the isnads.</li><li>Most of the isnads for the hadith converge to a few unreliable transmitters. Thus, the multiple isnads for the hadith are not independent, and they cannot be cited to strengthen each other.</li><li>Many of the isnads conflict with each other, further demonstrating the unreliability of these chains and how they cannot be cited to strengthen each other.</li><li>The report cannot be found in any of the &#8220;4 books&#8221;, which are the major hadith collections of the Shia.  Rather, it is mostly found in auxiliary Twelver hadith collections.</li></ol>

<p>*Al-Khoei concluded that Fudayl Al-Rassan was reliable due to his inclusion in Tafsir Al-Qommi. Various Twelver authorities today, however, have rightfully asserted that the preface to Tafsir Al-Qommi is inauthentic. Thus the inclusion of Fudayl Al-Rassan in Tafsir Al-Qommi is not tantamount to an endorsement , and he is unknown.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can these Isnads Strengthen Each Other?</h2>



<p>As seen above, every single isnad for this report is extremely weak and contains (at least) two unknown transmitters. Twelver polemicists, however, may attempt to argue that the abundance of isnads for this hadith can strengthen the hadith and elevate it to the status of authenticity. </p>



<p>Such appeals are futile. This claim assumes that all of these isnads are independent such that they are able to strengthen each other. A careful analysis of these isnads, however, demonstrates that most of the chains of transmission are not independent of each other.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reports 1-6 are all transmitted by Abu Al-Mufaddal Al-Shaybani, who was very weak.</li><li>Reports 1, 2 , 11, 17 and 19 are all transmitted by the unknown transmitter, Hinsh b. Al-Mu&#8217;tamir.</li><li>Reports 1, 2, 9, 11, 17 and 19 are all transmitted by the unknown transmitter Abu Ishaq Al-Hamadani.</li><li>Reports 3, 4 and 12 are all transmitted by the anonymous transmitter, Abu &#8216;Umar.</li><li>Reports 7 and 8 are both transmitted by the unknown transmitter, Musa b. &#8216;Uthman Al-Hadhrami.</li><li>Reports 16 and 17 are both transmitted by the unknown transmitter, Sa&#8217;id b. Al-Musayyab.</li></ul>



<p>It must be similarly noted that the extreme weakness in each of these isnads opens the possibility that they may all actually stem from one source, even though they may apparently not seem to. One cannot dispel the possibility that the tens of anonymous and unknown transmitters who all transmitted this report may have colluded with each other, or erroneously ascribed the report to multiple isnads. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conflicting Isnads</h2>



<p>Asides from the severe weakness of each of the isnads and their transmission through interdependent sources, another problem remains: the various contradictions in these chains of transmission. These interdependent isnads contradict each other on a variety of occasions, further demonstrating their unreliability.</p>

<p>Various other defects exist in the isnads for this report, but these examples shall suffice to demonstrate the defective transmission of this alleged hadith and the interdependence of isnads that may, at first glance, seem independent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>As demonstrated above, &#8220;Hadith Al-Safinah&#8221; clearly is an inauthentic tradition in Twelver sources. The weakness of this report manifests in several phenomena, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The overwhelming unreliability of its transmitters.</li><li>The interdependence of these unreliably transmitted isnads.</li><li>The conflicting transmission from these interdependent isnads.</li></ul>



<p>These observations cumulatively demonstrate the baselessness of this fabricated hadith, which was falsely ascribed to the Prophet . Ironically, Twelver polemicists today have the audacity to argue for the authenticity report from Sunni sources not knowing that it is baseless in their very own tradition. If the report is this weak in the Twelver tradition, then it should not be a surprise to Shi&#8217;ites today that it is even weaker in the Sunni tradition.</p>



<p>After reading this article, every Twelver must ask himself:</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is it that such an apparently fundamental report was exclusively transmitted by weak and unknown transmitters?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did the reliable transmitters of the time refrain from transmitting this report such that we do not possess a single authentic connected isnad for this hadith?&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps these questions (and others) may lead the sincere reader to the truth regarding this baseless Shi&#8217;ite fabrication.</p>



<p>And Allah is the witness of Abu Al-Abbas</p>
