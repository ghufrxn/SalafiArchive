<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: </p>



<p>This paper evaluates the historical authenticity of a prominent ḥadīth that is regularly cited amidst Sunnī-Shi&#8217;ite polemical discussions, the long ḥadīth of Abū Balj regarding`Alī&#8217;s merits. The significance of this Prophetic tradition stems from several clauses within it that are perceived to be aligned with Shi&#8217;ite theology and relevant to debates on the successorship of the Prophet. A careful study of this tradition, however, will demonstrate the presence of various defects in its transmission that ultimately undermine and dispel its historical authenticity.</p>

<p>Ḥadīth al-Thaqalayn is a renowned Prophetic tradition that has been classically and controversially cited and debated in Sunnī-Shī&#8217;ite polemics and early <em>Uṣūlī </em>works. A challenge that faces many of the appeals and discussions that revolve around this report is the fact that many inauthentic variants for the report exist, which are of varying theological and historical implications. </p>



<p>This study thus attempts to piece together the different variants of the report in Sunnī literature, and it then ascertains the most authentic of them all. After that, it assesses the authentic report(s) along with their implications, further contextualizing them with other reports, events and relevant historical details.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It may come as a surprise to many Shīas, that there are multiple hadīths in the classical Shīa works that speak of thirteen Imāms instead of twelve. Today, Shīa scholars would dismiss these are scribal errors. These reports often state that there will be Twelve Imāms from the descendants of the Prophet – peace be upon him – , meaning that `Alī is excluded from the Twelve.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidences for Thirteen Imāms</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Abdillāh bin Moḥammad Al-Kashshāb, from Ibn Samā`a, from `Alī bin Al-Ḥasan bin Ribāṭ, from Ibn Uḏayna, from Zurārah, that he said: I heard Abā Ja`afar (as) say: “<strong>The Twelve Imāms</strong> from the household of Moḥammad (peace be upon him and his household) are all spoken to (by angels), from the descendants of the Messenger  (peace be upon him and his household) and <strong>from the descendants of `Alī</strong>, and the Messenger of Allah and `Alī (as) are the fathers.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulaynī<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> narrated this hadīth through the path of Abī `Alī Al-Ash`arī, from Al-Ḥasan bin Ubaydillāh, from Al-Ḥasan bin Mūsā Al-Kashshāb from `Alī bin Samā`a.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hadīth was also reported by Al-Ṣaffār.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn, from Ibn Maḥbūb, from Abī Al-Jārūd, from Abī Ja`afar (as), that he said: “I entered upon Fāṭima (as) and in front of her was a tablet with the names of the <em>awsiya’ </em>(successors) <strong>from her descendants. I counted twelve</strong> with the last being Al-Qā`im (the Mahdī) (as). Three were named Moḥammad and three were named `Alī.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ṭūsī narrates this hadīth through an alternative chain with the same wording.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3-  Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Moḥammad bin Aḥmad, from Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn, from Abī Sa`īd Al-Uṣfurī, from `Amr bin Thābit, from Abī Al-Jārūd, from Abī Ja`afar (as) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his household) said: “Me and <strong>twelve of my descendants, and you O’ `Al</strong><strong>ī</strong>, are the stakes and the mountains of the earth. Allah uses us to hold firm the earth and not collapse, and if the <strong>Twelve from my descendants disappear</strong>, then the earth would collapse immediately.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Al-Kulaynī, with the same chain, from Abī Sa`īd, who narrated it from Abī Ja`afar in a disconnected form, from Abī Ja`afar (as), that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his household) said: “<strong>From my descendants are twelve honorable leaders</strong> that are spoken to (by angels), the last of them is the <em>Q</em><em>ā</em><em>`im</em> (the Mahdi) who shall fill it (the earth) with justice in the way it was filled with tyranny.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Al-Karājiki quotes Aḥmad bin Moḥammad bin Sa`īd, from Al-Qāsim bin Moḥammad bin Ubayd, from Ibn Kallūb, from Al-Ḥusayn bin Zayd bin `Alī, from Ja`afar bin Moḥammad, from his fathers, that `Alī said: The Messenger (peace be upon him and his household) said “…how can a nation with me in it, as well as <strong>twelve of my satisfied wise descendants</strong>, at its forefront, and the Messiah the son of Mary, in the end, fall to its demise?! Rather, the destruction shall occur to those in between, those who are not from me nor am I from them!”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- The earliest Shīa book, Kitāb Sulaym bin Qays, included evidence that the Imāms are thirteen. See below.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Thirteen?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reports that indicate that the Imāms were thirteen do not seem to be based upon any ideological basis, for there was no early “Thirteener” Movement. Unlike the reports that indicate that the Imāms are twelve, the reports above, are not ideologically driven. It is very possible that one of these reports was concocted with an arbitrary number and that it went on to spawn multiple hadīths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the fact that the book of Sulaym included the number thirteen, it is safe to say that this number most likely predated the number twelve, since Sulaym was a <em>tabi’ī</em>, who passed away in the first century of Islam.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Correcting the Imāms</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that each and every one of the six points provided above has been in a way “corrected”, in order to fit with the Twelver narrative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had previously analyzed examples #1 and #5 previously,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and I have concluded that these late distortions appear to have occurred at the hands of “Al-Ṣadūq”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Report #2 was tampered with multiple times in the works of Ibn Bābūyah,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> where the words “from her descendants” were removed. However, Ibn Bābūyah also quotes it with the same wording as Al-Kāfī in some of his other works,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> which indicate that these reports were manipulated by someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narrations #3 and #4 were tampered with as well. Both can be found in the <em>asl</em> of `Abbād Al-`Usfurī<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> with the number “eleven” replacing the number “twelve”. Even though the <em>asl</em> predates Al-Kāfī, the original manuscript was written in 374 AH by Manṣūr bin Al-Ḥasan bin Al-Ḥusayn Al-Ābī, fifty years after Al-Kulaynī. Furthermore, there is absolutely no reason for Al-Kulaynī to sabotage the hadīths of `Abbād, while it is favorable for the copyist to do so. However, one cannot be certain as to whether these distortions occurred at the hands of Al-Ābī, for it may have occurred by an earlier narrator or perhaps a later copyist. Naturally, we can be reassured that Al-Kāfī’s wordings are more representative of what `Abbād had originally written.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Number of Imāms in the Book of Sulaym</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally we come to the report of Sulaym bin Qays in his book, which according to Ibn Al-Ghaḍa`irī, advocated that the number of Imāms are thirteen.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> He denounces the book as a forgery due to this as well as other reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hibatullāh bin Aḥmad bin Moḥammad Al-Kātib, propagated this belief based on the contents of the book of Sulaym. He was the grandson of one of the emissaries of the Mahdī, who authored a work in which he claimed that the Imāms were thirteen, and included Zayd bin `Alī as one of them. He relied on a hadīth that stated that “the Imāms from the descendants of `Alī are twelve,” which could be found in the book of Sulaym. Hibatullāh passed away in the fifth century. Al-Najāshī, who provides us with this biographical information, puts no effort into correcting Hibatullāh’s usage of the report in the book of Sulaym. <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufīd<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> is not explicit about the number of Imāms, however, he does state that the book should not be relied upon, apparently due to hidden manipulations. It wouldn’t be surprising if Al-Mufīd held this opinion due to the reasons held by Ibn Al-Ghaḍā`irī.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in modern prints of the book of Sulaym today, we find that the number of Imāms is clearly twelve. Moḥammad Bāqir Al-Anṣārī, the editor of the book, quotes 24 instances in which they are numbered as twelve.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Is it possible that Ibn Al-Ghaḍā`irī, Hibatullāh Al-Kātib, and by extension Al-Najāshī all overlooked these instances?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears as though the case for Thirteen Imāms was one that was lost in time due to both the strength of the Twelver movement, as well as the manipulations in the hadīths. These manipulations would have most likely occurred during the <em>ghaybah</em> period, after the passing away of Al-Ḥasan Al-`Askarī, to support the Twelver ideology that only finally evolved into that form by the middle of the third century.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No doubt, the four emissaries (Sufara&#8217;) of the Twelver Shia&#8217;s 12th Imam or &#8220;Mahdi&#8221; as they call him are some of the most suspicious characters in classical Islamic history. Below, we will translate a piece of the research one of our brothers conducted in Arabic may Allah benefit us all through it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin with the death of the 11th Imam, al-Hasan al-`Askari in 260 AH. The Imami Shia who claimed the birth of a son, viewed it necessary to follow an emissary in the absence of their hidden leader. A person who acts as his representative when it comes to collecting money and answering questions. The Shia scholars agreed that one of the conditions of recognizing the authentic emissaries from among the frauds is that they will produce letters with the noble handwriting of the Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is to be noted, that those emissaries concentrated a lot more on collecting Khums money than on answering religious questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, the four emissaries seemed so ignorant that they could not answer more than a hundred questions of Islamic jurisprudence within the entire period of seventy years. Refer back to their narrations to see the small amount of religious matters they dealt with. Of course, this is confirmed by the Shia scholar Muhammad Sanad al-Bahrani who says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">هو أنه كان نصب النواب الأربعة من الناحية المقدسة في الأمور التنفيذية من قبض مال الصاحب ورفع الأسئلة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The four emissaries were appointed by the holy seat (12th Imam) to take care of <strong>executive matters</strong> such as collecting his money and transmitting the questions to him]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were unqualified that major Imami scholars like al-Kulayni himself who lived in their time completely ignored them probably due to distrust. They failed to answer many of the questions so they&#8217;d shamelessly ask people to do their own research instead. Muhammad Sanad states:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حتى إن في كثير من الاسئلة الموجهة للناحية المقدسة يجيبهم عجل الله فرجه بالرجوع الى كتب الروايات</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[In a lot of the questions transmitted to the holy seat, he (as) responds by telling them to <strong>refer back to the books</strong> of the narrations for answers.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Buhuth fi Mabani `Ilm-ul-Rijal pg.47-48</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It actually seems those emissaries themselves could not benefit from the presence of the absent Imam. Shia leader al-Tusi says that the third emissary, Husayn bin Rawh authored a book in which he compiled the narrations of the narrators from the previous Imams then presented it to the scholars and jurists of Qum so they may authenticate it for him. The Qummies did so, except the matter concerning the allotted amount for Zakat-ul-Fitr as that was in conflict with the sect&#8217;s consensus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.390</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, the first and second emissaries had to write a book on what they heard from the two `Askari Imams as well as the reports of the narrators from previous Imams. This book was inherited by a woman from their progeny and the sect of Shia accepted it as one of their books of Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.363</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These emissaries announced that they are in direct contact with the hidden leader, the secret son of al-Hasan al-`Askari who had just died. In order to fool the Shia community, they began producing letters called Tawqee`at (rescripts) which they claimed were written by the concealed Imam in his own handwriting and noble seal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how the matter of these writings progressed:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time of Imam al-Hasan al-`Askari (died 260 AH): Letters were being issued in his name with the infallible handwriting via his representatives `Uthman bin Sa`id and his son Muhammad bin `Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time of `Uthman bin Sa`id al-`Amri (died 265 AH): The first emissary and perfect man for the job, an oil merchant! letters continued being issued in the same infallible handwriting as before until his death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time of Muhammad bin `Uthman al-`Amri (died 304 AH): The son of the first emissary, letters continued being issued in the same infallible handwriting until Muhammad was on his death-bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time of Husayn bin Rawh al-Nawbakhti (died 326 AH): Letters were no longer being issued in infallible handwriting and the mentioning of the holy seal ceased. The third emissary and his companion wrote in their own handwriting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief, the same handwriting was being produced during the time of Imam al-Hasan al-`Askari, during the time of the first emissary `Uthman bin Sa`id and after they both died, it continued during the time of the second emissary Muhammad bin `Uthman but stopped while he was on his deathbed. This leads us to believe that the person who was forging these rescripts in the name of al-`Askari as well as after his death and kept producing the same handwriting was none other than the first emissary&#8217;s son Muhammad bin `Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وذكر أبو نصر هبة الله [ بن ] محمد بن أحمد أن أبا جعفر العمري رحمه الله مات في سنة أربع وثلاثمائة ، وأنه كان يتولى هذا الامر نحوا من خمسين سنة يحمل الناس إليه أموالهم ، ويخرج إليهم التوقيعات بالخط الذي كان يخرج في حياة الحسن عليه السلام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Tusi says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu Nasr Hibatullah bin Muhammad bin Ahmad mentioned that aba Ja`far al-`Amri (second emissary) may God have mercy on him died in the year 304. He used to be in charge of this matter for around fifty years, the people were giving him their money while he kept producing the rescripts in <strong>the same handwriting as those produced during the life of al-Hasan</strong> (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.366</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Majlisi writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وكانت توقيعات صاحب الامر عليه السلام تخرج على يدي عثمان بن سعيد (السفير الأول) وابنه أبي جعفر محمد بن عثمان (السفير الثاني) إلى شيعته وخواص أبيه أبي محمد عليه السلام &#8211; بالأمر والنهي والأجوبة عما تسأل الشيعة عنه إذا احتاجت إلى السؤال فيه &#8211; بالخط الذي كان يخرج في حياة الحسن عليه السلام</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The rescripts of the master of the age (as) continued to be issued by the hands of `Uthman bin Sa`id (first emissary) and his son abi Ja`far Muhammad bin `Uthman (second emissary). These writings would reach his (as) Shia as well as his father&#8217;s (as) closest companions -containing orders, prohibitions &amp; answers to the Shia&#8217;s questions- in <strong>the same handwriting that used to emerge in the life of al-Hasan</strong> (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Bihar al-Anwar 51/346</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the time of Muhammad bin `Uthman and his father, the same handwriting continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أبو العباس : وأخبرني هبة الله بن محمد ابن بنت أم كلثوم بنت أبي جعفر العمري رضي الله عنه ، عن شيوخه قالوا : لم تزل الشيعة مقيمة على عدالة عثمان بن سعيد رحمه الله (السفير الأول) وغسله ابنه أبو جعفر محمد بن عثمان (السفير الثاني) وتولى القيام به وجعل الامر كله مردودا إليه ، والشيعة مجمعة على عدالته وثقته وأمانته ، لما تقدم له من النص عليه بالأمانة والعدالة ، والامر بالرجوع إليه في حياة الحسن عليه السلام وبعد موته في حياة أبيه عثمان بن سعيد ، لا يختلف في عدالته ، ولا يرتاب بأمانته ، و التوقيعات يخرج على يده إلى الشيعة في المهمات طول حياته بالخط الذي كانت تخرج في حياة أبيه عثمان</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu al-`Abbas said: I was told by Hibatullah bin Muhammad ibn bint Umm Kulthum the daughter of abi Ja`far al-`Amri (ra), that his teachers told him: The Shia continued to agree on the uprightness of `Uthman bin Sa`id (first emissary), he was washed by his son abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Uthman (second emissary) who took charge of all his affairs while the Shia agreed on his uprightness, reliability and trust. This is due to the aforementioned statements declaring his trustworthiness and reliability by al-Hasan (as) during his life as well as during the life of his father `Uthman bin Sa`id, none questioned his integrity and the rescripts emerged through him to the Shia during the entirety of his life in <strong>the same handwriting as that during his father `Uthman&#8217;s life</strong>.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.220</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when the second emissary became terribly ill, right before his death he announced his will that he is to be succeeded by Ibn Rawh verbally without any written document with infallible handwriting or noble seal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأخبرنا ( جماعة ) عن أبي محمد هارون بن موسى ، قال : أخبرني أبو علي محمد بن همام رضي الله عنه وأرضاه أن أبا جعفر محمد بن عثمان العمري قدس الله روحه جمعنا قبل موته وكنا وجوه الشيعة وشيوخها . فقال لنا : إن حدث علي حدث الموت فالامر إلى أبي القاسم الحسين بن روح النوبختي فقد أمرت أن أجعله في موضعي بعدي فارجعوا إليه وعولوا في أموركم عليه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We were told by a group, from abu Muhammad Harun bin Musa that he said: I was told by abu `Ali Muhammad bin Hammam (ra) that abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Uthman al-`Amri (second emissary) gathered the heads and leaders of the Shia right before his death. <strong>He told us</strong>: &#8220;If I die, then the affair belongs to abu al-Qasim bin Rawh. <strong>I was ordered</strong> to place him in my position so seek him and rely on him.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأخبرني الحسين بن إبراهيم عن ابن نوح ، عن أبي نصر هبة الله بن محمد قال : حدثني خالي أبو إبراهيم جعفر بن أحمد النوبختي قال : قال لي أبي أحمد بن إبراهيم وعمي أبو جعفر عبد الله بن إبراهيم وجماعة من أهلنا يعني بني نوبخت : أن أبا جعفر العمري لما اشتدت حاله اجتمع جماعة من وجوه الشيعة ، منهم أبو علي بن همام وأبو عبد الله بن محمد الكاتب وأبو عبد الله الباقطاني وأبو سهل إسماعيل بن علي النوبختي وأبو عبد الله بن الوجناء وغيرهم من الوجوه ( و ) الأكابر ، فدخلوا على أبي جعفر ( رض ) فقالوا له : إن حدث أمر فمن يكون مكانك ؟ فقال لهم : هذا أبو القاسم الحسين بن روح بن أبي بحر النوبختي القائم مقامي والسفير بينكم وبين صاحب الامر عليه السلام والوكيل [ له ] والثقة الأمين ، فارجعوا إليه في أموركم وعولوا عليه  في مهماتكم فبذلك أمرت وقد بلغت</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I was told by al-Husayn bin Ibrahim from Ibn Nuh, from Nasr bin Hibatullah bin Muhammad: I was told by my uncle abu Ibrahim Ja`far bin Ahmad al-Nawbakhti: I was told by my father Ahmad bin Ibrahim and uncle abu Ja`far `Abdullah bin Ibrahim and a group of our family (banu Nawbakht) that: When aba Ja`far al-`Amri&#8217;s (second emissary) illness intensified, a group of Shia leaders gathered (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) He told them: &#8220;This is abu al-Qasim al-Husayn bin Rawh bin abi Bahr al-Nawbakhti, he shall take my place and be the emissary between you and the possessor of authority (as), he shall be his trusted representative so seek him and rely on him in your duties <strong>for I was ordered to tell you this</strong>.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.371-372</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, he never produced any letters here because he was dying and therefore couldn&#8217;t forge one with the same perfected handwriting and noble infallible seal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the third emissary, all rescripts and letters in his time were either his own handwriting or that of a friend, no mention of any infallible handwriting or noble seals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tusi says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">أخبرنا جماعة ، عن أبي الحسن محمد بن أحمد بن داود القمي قال : وجدت بخط أحمد بن إبراهيم النوبختي وإملاء أبي القاسم الحسين بن روح (السفير الثالث) رضي الله عنه على ظهر كتاب فيه جوابات ومسائل أنفذت من قم</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I was told by a group, from abi al-Hasan Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Dawud al-Qummi, he said: I found in the handwriting of Ahmad bin Ibrahim al-Nawbakhti, as was <strong>written by</strong> <strong>abu al-Qasim al-Husayn bin Rawh</strong> (third emissary) on the back of a book containing answers and questions from the city of Qum.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأخبرني جماعة ، عن أبي العباس بن نوح قال : وجدت بخط محمد بن نفيس فيما كتبه بالأهواز أول كتاب ورد من أبي القاسم رضي الله عنه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I was told by a group, from abu al-`Abbas bin Nuh, he said: I found the first book that came from abu al-Qasim (third emissary) which was <strong>in the handwriting of Muhammad bin Nafis</strong> who wrote it in al-Ahwaz]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وقال ابن نوح : أول من حدثنا بهذا التوقيع أبو الحسين محمد بن علي بن تمام ، ( و ) ذكر أنه كتبه من ظهر الدرج الذي عند أبي الحسن بن داود ، فلما قدم أبو الحسن بن داود وقرأته عليه ، ذكر أن هذا الدرج بعينه كتب به أهل قم إلى الشيخ أبي القاسم وفيه مسائل ، فأجابهم على ظهره بخط أحمد بن إبراهيم النوبختي وحصل الدرج عند أبي الحسن بن داود . نسخة الدرج مسائل محمد بن عبد الله بن جعفر الحميري : &#8221; بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم أطال الله بقاءك ، وأدام عزك</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">الدرج بمعنى الكتاب تُدرج فيها الكتابة على رقٍ أو صحيفةٍ بطريقةٍ متعارفة &#8211; أي نسخة الکتاب المدرج المطوي، کتبه أهل قم و سألوا عن بيان صحته</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And Ibn Nuh said: the first who told us about the rescript was abu al-Husayn (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) he mentioned that this specific book was from the people of Qum who addressed it to abu al-Qasim (third emissary) and it contained questions so he (third emissary) wrote them back the answers on the back of that book <strong>with the handwriting of Ahmad bin Ibrahim al-Nawbakhti</strong> (&#8230;etc)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وأخبرني أبو محمد المحمدي رضي الله عنه ، عن أبي الحسين محمد بن الفضل بن تمام رحمه الله قال : سمعت أبا جعفر بن محمد بن أحمد ( بن ) الزكوزكي رحمه الله &#8211; وقد ذكرنا كتاب التكليف ، وكان عندنا أنه لا يكون إلا مع غال ، وذلك أنه أول ما كتبنا الحديث &#8211; فسمعناه يقول : وأيش كان لابن أبي العزاقر في كتاب التكليف إنما كان يصلح الباب ويدخله إلى الشيخ أبي القاسم الحسين بن روح رضي الله عنه ، فيعرضه عليه ويحككه فإذا صح الباب خرج فنقله وأمرنا بنسخه ، يعني أن الذي أمرهم به الحسين بن روح رضي الله عنه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I was told by abu Muhammad al-Muhammadi (ra), from abi al-Husayn Muhammad bin al-Fadl bin Tammam (ra), he said: I heard aba Ja`far bin Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Zakzuki (ra) say when the book &#8220;al-Taklif&#8221; was mentioned to him -We believed this book can only be found with extremists- when we first began to write narrations, we heard him say: &#8220;What did Ibn al-`Azaqir al-Shalmaghani do concerning his book &#8220;al-Taklif&#8221;? He used to only edit the chapters and present them to abi al-Qasim al-Husayn bin Rawh (third emissary) who reviewed it. Then <strong>he would copy it and order us to write it down</strong> if he deemed it correct.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ghaybat-ul-Tusi pg.372, 373, 374, 389</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, the third emissary Ibn Rawh realized that the noble infallible handwriting perished the moment the second emissary Muhammad bin `Uthman died, so he began writing himself and ordering his followers to write whatever verbal orders he claimed to recieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, `Ali bin Muhammad al-Samari (died 329 AH) was the fourth and last emissary. He barely ruled three years before he died without an heir and accomplished absolutely nothing. This was most likely due to the emergence of  the Buwayhid Shia dynasty. <strong>The station of emissaries ended around the same time the Buwayhid Shia reached power</strong> and established their own state. The Buwayhids were now the representatives of the Shia community and their protectors. They will not share their authority with any Imam or representative since only one party can be in control. The heads of the Shia rejoiced when the Buwayhids ascended to authority and decided that the so called 12th Imam must disappear from our lives to please their new masters and thus began the &#8220;greater occultation&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the actual identities of the Imams, there is no specific aspect of Imamate that is as important as the concept of infallibility. Infallibility is the line between a religious opinion and a divine regulation. If it were not for the concept of infallibility, the lines between Sunnis and Shias would perhaps cease to exist, since both parties would rely on the Prophet – peace be upon him – for their guidance alone, and not thirteen other infallibles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article will take a brief look at the stages of evolution in Shiasm:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Heretical Sects</li>
<li>Early Companions of the Imams</li>
<li>Hisham bin Al-Hakam and Infallibility</li>
<li>The Fourth Century</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heretical Sects</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It goes without saying that some early heretical sects believed that certain Imams were infallible. However, their belief in infallibility was not a separate belief on its own; rather, it came with the belief in the divinity of certain Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is historically agreed upon that some early fanatics believed that Ali was God. Naturally, infallibility came with these claims of divinity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examples of this include some of the Kaysaniyyah, who believed that the soul of Allah was manifested into the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , then Ali, then Al-Hasan, then Al-Hussain, then Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah, and so on. (Firaq Al-Shia p. 40)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example is some of the Khattabiyyah who believed that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq was Allah and that Abu Al-Khattab was a prophet. (Firaq Al-Shia p. 53)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The earliest example of such an extreme belief comes in the form of the Saba’iyyah who would claimed that Ali was God during his caliphate. (Rijal Al-Kashshi p. 84-85)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to keep in mind that these Shias do not represent what we know today as Twelver Shiasm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Early Companions of the Imams</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the following decades, it did not seem that “mainstream” Imami Shias adopted this view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Shaheed Al-Thani, in Haqa’iq Al-Eman (p. 151) points out his observations on early Imami society by saying, “Many of them (companions of the Imams) did not believe in their (the Imam’s) infallibility, because it wasn’t clear to them, but rather, many just believed that they were pious scholars, and this is known to those that read their biographies and narrations, and in the book of Abu Amr Al-Kashshi some (examples) of these.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is very apparent, especially in the narrations of some of the closest companions of Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq. Like always, we will be providing examples through narrations that are authentic according to Shia standards. Below, we list these companions, along with narrations that clearly show that they did not believe in the infallibility of the Imams.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Zurarah bin A’ayan (d. 150 AH)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was the closest companion of Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq. Al-Kashshi mentioned that he is one of the six closest companions and that the Shias are in agreement in believing him. He said: They (the Shias) said: “The most knowledgeable from among them is Zurarah.” (Al-Kashshi p. 174) By returning to books of hadith, we find that there is no companion, from the companions of the Imams that narrated as many narrations as Zurarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kashshi (p. 119) then narrated, from Mohammad bin Mas’oud, that Al-Fadhl bin Shathan wrote to him, from Ibn Abi Umair from Ibrahim bin Abdul Hamid, from Eisa bin Abi Mansour, Abu Usama Al-Shahham, and Ya’qoub Al-Ahmar that they said, “We were sitting with Abu Abdullah – peace be onto him – when Zurarah came in and said, “Al-Hakam bin Uyayna (Utayba) narrates from your father (Al-Baqir) that he said, “Pray Maghrib before arriving at Muzdalifa.” Abu Abdullah – peace be onto him said – : “I contemplated, my father never said such a thing, and Al-Hakam lies upon my father.” Zurarah then left while saying, “<strong>I do not believe that Al-Hakam lied upon his father</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Abu Baseer Yahya bin Al-Qasim (d. 150 AH)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Zurarah, Abu Baseer was also included in the list of six closest companions of Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq. By returning to hadith books, we find that along with Zurarah, he is one of the top narrators of Shia hadith. (Al-Kashshi p. 174)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kashshi (p. 129) said: From Hamdan, he said: Mu’awiyah narrated to us, from Shu’ayb Al-Aqarqufi, from Abi Baseer: I asked Abu Abdullah – peace be onto him – about a married woman that got married (to another) and was caught. He (Abu Abdullah) said, “She is to be stoned and the man is to be whipped a hundred times for not asking.” Shu’ayb said: I went to Abu Al-Hasan – peace be onto him – and said, “A married woman that gets married (to another)?” He said, “She is to be stoned, while nothing happens to the man.” (Shu’ayb said:) I then met Abu Baseer and told him that I asked Abu Al-Hasan – peace be onto him – about a married woman that gets married (to another) and he said that she is stoned and  he is not punished. Abu Baseer then wiped his chest and said, “<strong>I do not believe that our friend’s wisdom is at its peak yet.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Aban bin Taghlib (d. 140 AH)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aban was a close companion of Zain Al-Abideen, Al-Baqir, and Al-Sadiq. He was appointed by Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq in the mosque of the Prophet – peace be upon him – to teach the people. (Rija Al-Najashi p. 10 and Rijal Al-Kashshi p. 235)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Babawaih narrated in Man la Yahduruhu Al-Faqeeh 4/842:  Abdulrahman bin Al-Hajjaj narrated from Aban bin Taghlib that he said: I told Abi Abdullah – peace be onto him &#8211; : “What do you say about a man that cuts off the finger of a woman?” He said, “Ten camels.” I said, “What about two?” He said, “Twenty.” I said, “Three.” He said, “Thirty.” I said, “Four.” He said, “Twenty.” I said, “Praise be to Allah! If he cuts thirty, then he pays thirty, but if he cuts four then he pays twenty?! <strong>We heard of this while we were in Iraq and we’d disavow ourselves from who says this! We said: This is the view of Satan!</strong>” He said, “Calm down Aban, this is the view of the Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him &#8211; …”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Abu Al-Abbas Al-Fadhl bin Abdul-Malik Al-Baqbaq</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Al-Fadhl was a reliable companion of Ja’afar Al-Sadiq. (Al-Najashi p. 308)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kashshi (p. 239) from Hamdooyah and Mohammad, from Mohammad bin Eisa, from Safwan, from Abdulrahman bin Al-Hajjaj, that Abu Al-Abbas Fadhl Al-Baqbaq asked Abu Abdullah – peace be onto him – to allow entry for Hareez, but he didn’t allow him in. He then tried again and he was rejected. Then he (Fadhl) said, “How far can a man go in punishing his young boy?” He (Abu Abdullah) said, “As far as his crimes.” He (Al-Fadhl) said, “<strong>By Allah you have punished Hareez in a way greater than he deserves</strong>.” He said, “I have not, for Hareez unsheathed his sword,” He continued, “If it was Huthaifa bin Mansour, he wouldn’t have repeated it once I said no.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hareez Al-Sijistani</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A reliable companion of Ja’afar Al-Sadiq and one of the biggest hadith narrators. See the above narration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above examples indicate that some of the closest companions of the early Imams did not hold the view that the Imams were infallible. If they did, they would not dispute their judgment in the way that they did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hisham bin Al-Hakam and Infallibility<br />
</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the time of the major students of Al-Baqir and Al-Sadiq, Hisham bin Al-Hakam (d. 199 AH), a companion of Al-Sadiq and Al-Kathim, made the concept of infallibility a mainstream belief. Hisham was a very significant Shi’ee and information about him and his followers can be found in most, if not all books that detail Islamic sects. Ibn Al-Nadeem, in his biography of Hisham in his Fihrist, states that Hisham was the first to expound on the concept of Imamah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for his influence in the making the concept of infallibility mainstream, the following can be found in the works of early scholars:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Abu Hasan Al-Ash’ari (d. 324 AH) in his Maqalaat (p. 56) said, “The <em>rawafidh</em> differed as to whether it is possible for the Messenger – peace be upon him – to sin. One group said that it is possible for him to sin against Allah, which is what he did with the prisoners of war at Badr, while it is not possible for the Imams to sin, since the <em>wahee</em>, which came from Allah would come to the Messenger if he sinned, while the Imams do not have <em>wahee</em>, nor do they receive angels, so they are infallible and do not make mistakes, even though it is possible for the Messenger to sin. This is the view of Hisham bin Al-Hakam.”</li>
<li>Al-Malti (d. 377 AH), an Athari scholar said, “He (Hisham) said that it is impossible for him (Ali) to make a mistake, or be ignorant, or to be incapable, and that he is infallible.”</li>
<li>Al-Qadhi Abdul Jabbar Al-Mu’tazili (d. 415 AH) adds in his Tathbeet Dala’il Al-Nubuwwa 2/528 that early Shias did not believe in the infallibility of Ali, and that the first to have held this view is Hisham bin Al-Hakam.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three statements come from three early scholars that come from different ideologies, but were close enough to the time of Hisham to be aware of his views and influence. Even though there are differences in the above three statements, we find three different scholars attributing the concept to Hisham bin Al-Hakam specifically, instead of attributing it to Shiasm in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">These statements are supported by a section in Ibn Babawayh’s Ma’ani Al-Akhbar (p. 117-118), where he provides three narrations under the heading: Meaning of the Ismah (infallibility) of the Imam. In the section, he provides two narrations that are directly from Hisham bin Al-Hakam.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Hussain Al-Ashqar said: I asked Hisham bin Al-Hakam, “What is the meaning of your view that the Imam is infallible?” He (Hisham) said, “I asked Abu Abdullah – peace be onto him – and he said, ‘An infallible is one that is prevented by Allah from his prohibitions for Allah said: ‘And whoever holds fast to Allah, he indeed is guided to the right path. (3:101)’’”</li>
<li>Ibn Abi Umair said, “I did not hear or gain from Hisham bin Al-Hakam in my lengthy time with him something better than what he spoke of about the infallibility of the Imam. One day, I asked him, ‘Is the Imam infallible?’ He said, ‘Yes’. I said, ‘Then how is he infallible and how is this known?’”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement above shows that Ibn Abi Umair, who was one of the six most reliable students of Al-Kathim (Al-Kashshi p. 394), who was more knowledgeable that Yunus bin Abdul-Rahman, the most knowledgeable Shia scholar of his time (Al-Kashshi p. 416), only learned about infallibility from Hisham bin Al-Hakam, not from the Imams themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, it would be false to claim that Hisham created the concept, since it did exist among early heretical sects, however, we can conclude from the above that Hisham made it a mainstream opinion. Another possible conclusion is that he was the first Shia scholar to hold the belief while rejecting the divinity of the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Infallibility in the Fourth Century</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelver Shiasm, as one can find in our articles on the ideology was an evolving ideology. The plethora of narrations that were left behind by the companions of the Imams were finally used to canonize a complete ideology, and this was seen in action through the works of classical scholars like Ibn Babawayh, Al-Mufeed, and Al-Tusi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Babawayh (d. 381 AH) in his I’itiqadaat (Musanafaat Al-Mufeed 5/96) said the following in his chapter on infallibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our belief in the prophets, messengers, Imams, and angels, is that they are infallible and cleansed from all impurity, that they do not commit major or minor sins, nor do they go against Allah in what He has ordered them, and they do as they are told by Him. Whoever rejects their infallibility in any of their states is ignorant of them. We believe that they are perfect and complete, knowledgeable in all matters from beginning to end, and that incompletion, sin, or ignorance, cannot be ascribed to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The editor adds that in several manuscripts of the work, there is an addition which states that “whoever rejects their infallibility, in any of their states is ignorant of them, and whoever is ignorant of them, is a disbeliever.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufeed (d. 413 AH), who is known for refuting Ibn Babawayh, affirms his beliefs in infallibility, and thus, this ideology remains a part of Twelver Shiasm to our times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The belief in infallibility was not always a mainstream belief that was adopted by all Shias, rather, it was a heretical belief at first, but only became a mainstream view due to Hisham bin Al-Hakam (d. 199 AH), before finally being canonized when books of ideology were compiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias may argue that the infallibility of the Imams was never a matter of dispute and that it is clear in the Qur’an in verse 33:33. However, the Imams did not say that this is evidence of their infallibility, but rather, provided a completely different interpretation.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Examining Shiite theology seems complex at face value, yet when we dive further into the historical development of the Twelver Shiite tradition we begin to face a multitude of historical and theological issues primarily inconsistencies, reinterpretations, polemics, and numerous hadith traditions that of which may or may not be considered authentic or contain reliable chains of transmission. The notion of twelve infallible hereditary Imams stemming from the lineage of Prophet Muhammad can and has always been contested by the Sunni majority, early Mu’tazilite scholars as well as internally within various Shiite theological and intellectual circles. Yet Shiite scholars throughout the course of Islamic history had to articulate themselves in such a manner that the idea of an Imamate lineage would have to be accepted upon some basis of religious authority of theologians and scriptural authenticity. A literary analysis of the historical accounts of the way in which Twelver Shiite creed formulated can be seen in the works of Etan Kohlberg, W. Montgomery Watt, Marshall G.S. Hodgson, and Wilfred Madelung.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">                When we analyze the historical development of Twelver theology, we must acknowledge the starting point from which everything initiated. Etan Kohlberg highlights in his article, <em>From Imamiyya to Ithna ‘Ashariyya</em>, the prototype variation of what would later on come to be known as the Twelver Shiite sect. Kohlberg argues the concept of Imamate existed in the the seventh century, and was later given a definitive shape by classical Shiite scholar Hisham bin al-Hakam in the middle of the eighth century<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.  Hodgson, however, argues that early Shiism cannot be defined based on the standards of what would eventually evolve into later Twelver Shiite Islam as the creed could not have been fully defined as it was still in its earliest stages. The concealment of the hidden Imam is what would cultivate the Twelver theology in the tenth century, yet we see earlier evidence in favor of the doctrine. Both Kohlberg and Watt mention that the earliest evidence in favor of such a belief can be found in the <em>Kitab Firaq al-Shi’a</em> produced by al-Hassan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti as well as in the <em>Kitab al-Malaqat wa’l-firaq</em> of Sa’d bin Abdallah al-Qummi, both of which would have been completed around 900 AD<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. However, Hodgson insists that the notion of twelve hereditary imams was not even conceivable as a concept as the earliest group among the Shiites were Zayidis and therefore could not have possibly split off from the Twelver sect as there was no concrete list of twelve infallible individuals said to have succeeded the Prophet Muhammad yet<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">                Concentrating heavily on the justifications and proofs of the Imamite belief, Kohlberg discusses the arguments put forth by early Ithna ‘Ashariyya scholars, or Twelvers, who he calls the Imamiyya. He begins to notice that although the Twelver doctrine began to become heavily shaped in the tenth century, we see numerous theological inconsistencies and gaps early on in the same time period. Kohlberg highlights that there was an absence of the <em>ghayba</em>, or occultation, tradition in early Imamiyya texts such as <em>Basa’ir al-Darajat</em> written by early Twelver scholar Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Saffar al-Qummi (d. 903) although he writes extensively about the virtues of the twelve Imams without explicitly mentioning their names. The same issue occurs again regarding the lack of traditions of the two occultation periods in other texts such as <em>Kitab al-Mahasin</em> written by Abu Ja’far Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Khalid al-Barqi (d. 893)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>. It was not until Muhammad bin Ali bin Babawayhi (d. 991) who began to expand upon the concept of prolonged concealment beyond the ordinary human life span do we see no clear statements in relation to the details of how the occultation periods would take place<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>.Hodgson does add on an interesting point in which he discusses the <em>Ghulat</em>, or exaggerators, from among the early Shiites. They would place a great deal of emphasis on different concepts that, as Hodgson suggests, would give birth to themes which would be integrated into Twelver Shiism, concepts such as <em>raj’a</em>, or return, and <em>ghayba,</em> occultation. These ideas proposed by earlier Ghulat were not regarded as unsophisticated among the elite Arab ruling class but could contribute to the broader context of the elite’s aspirations<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>. Hodgson states “nor is there anything more extreme in expecting a man to return whom others regard as dead – assome of the early Ghulat did – than in the expectation of the so-called moderate Sh’ia that a man will return whom others doubt was ever born”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly enough, concrete evidence of twelve hereditary Imams isalso not present or seem to be incomplete in their orchestration inearly Shiite Imamiyya works. Kohlberg mentions the significance of the number twelve being ambiguous although a mixture of the earliest Imams are in fact mentioned and in some cases up until the tenth Imam. In the work of Abu Ja’far Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Khalid al-Barqi know as <em>Kitab al-Ashkal wa’l-Qara’in</em>, he references different hadith traditions dealing with the significance of different numbers. Kohlberg analyzes his ambiguity on the number twelve by stating “yet he is content with citing traditions on the numbers 3 to 10, and does not deemit necessary to proceed up to the number 12”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. Soon thereafter Kohlberg briefly discusses contrasting evidence derived from the work of Ibn Babawayhi in which the number twelve is expanded upon and defined yet the names of the Imams are still not explicitly mentioned. The two texts of both of these tenth century Imamiyya Shiite scholars were presumably written either right before or shortly after the initial ghayba period, <em>al ghayba al-sughra</em>. Kohlberg concludes in this part of his article that “the absence of specifically Twelver Shi’i beliefs from these works probably means that belief in 12 Imams had not yet been formulated as an Imami tenet”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>. It is noted, however, that the theorization of the official Twelver Shi’i tenet of twelve Imams is shaped by the Tafsir, or commentary, of Shiite scholar Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi (d. 919) when a narration regarding Khidr, a figure appearing in the Quranic narrative of the story of Moses, speaking to Ali and his son Hassan and reveals the names of each of the twelve Imams. Kohlberg highlights “the culmination of this process is reached with the Usul al-Kafi” of Shiite hadith scholar Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’quibi al Kulaini (d. 941)<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet even afterwards, much was contested internally among intellectual and theological circles of Shiite scholarship and there had to be a way to clearly explain the Twelver doctrine in a way that would be rational enough to comprehend and prove the validity of such a claim. Kohlberg introduces to us to a set of principles that would define the methodology of how the Twelver creed would be revealed and elucidated by Ibn Babawayhi.The first component of proving the Imamate stems from various arguments derived from the Quran. Different Quranic passages with the number 12 are seen occasionally and serve as a sign for early Twelver Imamites and thus became of deep interest and intrigue for Shiite scholars. Verses of the Quran with the number twelve explicitly mentioned were to have been interpreted by both Imam Muhammad Baqir, the fifth Imam and Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, as being a reference to the twelve Imams. The second method in which the Twelver doctrine was extrapolated from are the arguments stemming from Shi’i traditions. Kohlberg explains that the relevant hadith narrations are broadly divided into two main categories;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“first, traditions according to which there existed already during the Prophet’s lifetime several documents in which the names of the 12 Imams were detailed. One of these documents is the tablet (lawh) which the Companion Jabir bin Abdallah allegedly saw at Fatima’s house. Another is a scroll (sahifa) given to Ali by the Prophet, which is said to have consisted of 12 sections, each sealed by a separate seal. The Prophet instructed Ali to break open the first seal and act in accordance with the instructions in the underlying section; then the process would be repeated with each succeeding Imam”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kohlberg then briefly mentions a third scroll allegedly written two thousand years prior to the creation of Adam which later on was retrieved by Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq. The second category where Kohlberg highlights to us is the different Shiite hadith traditions consisting of narrations where the Prophet speaks of twelve consecutive Imams who would succeed him. Hodgson intriguingly focuses more on three groups within early Shiism that would ultimately shape Twelver doctrine later on. Hodgson mentions the three separate groups contesting among themselves and states “But the conventional approach to the Ghulat – they were the left wing of the Shi’a, a posited Twelver “moderation” being its center and the mild Zaydis its right wing – is hardly acceptable, certainly for the earlier period which is most fully described by the heresiographers”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>.  At the same time Hodgson also suggests that the Imamate of Ja’far As-Sadiq was somewhat reactionary to the Ghulat and other such groups and really defined how the Imamate would be designated and would essentially provide a structure for how the canonization of the twelve Imams would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Montgomery Watt looks at the construction of early Imamate doctrine through different approaches in his article entitled “Sidelights on Early Imamite Doctrine”. Initially heexplores the Imamite creed and how it remained contested and inconsistent until the tenth century after the alleged disappearance of the twelfth Imam during the beginning of the ghayba, occultation, period in 874 A.D. to 941 A.D. Only then do early Shiites begin to refer to themselves as Imamites although the concept had already existed prior to the minor and major occultation periods.He then explores the early interactions and debates that took place between Imamate Shiite scholars and early Mu’tazilites during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph, Harun Al Rashid. This reflects one of many things, mainly that the prototype-Shiite groups of the tenth century were in fact not as marginalized as much as we may have initially thought but rather actively engaged in a wide range of discussions, exchanging of ideas, polemic debates, and theological complexities. Neither were they diametrically opposed schools of theological thought but instead displayed a sense of tolerance for one another which allowed for such fruitful discussions to take place. Such scholars consisted of people like Ali ibn Mitham (ibn At-Tammar) and al Fadhl ibn Shadhan (d. 874). What is also intriguing, is how Watts mentions early Shiite scholar Shaykh Abu Ja’far Muhammad At-Tusi (d. 1067) and his compilation of early Shiite texts. These texts, however, do not focus on the concept of Imamate, but rather focus on matters of “law or liturgical observance such as divorce, temporary marriage, (mut’a), prayer, the pilgrimage” and were somewhat similar to that of Sunni books of jurisprudence<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. This exemplifies the notion that Twelver Imamate doctrine was not heavily written about or crystalized early on which coincides with Hodgson’s proposal in which codified Twelver Imamism cannot be discussed in the context of the seventh century as it did not exist yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Watt continues to discuss the early orchestration of the major contested Imamate question in the tenth century; what was the process in which Imamate was designated and who would inherit the prestigious position? An early Imamate group known as the Fut’hiyya, or Aftahiyya, were beginning to raise the questions of hereditary lineage and designation. Watt examines their theories during the time between the seventh Imam, Ja’far As-Sadiq (d. 765) and his son Musa Al Kadhim. According to Watt, Imam Ja’afar As Sadiq’s first born son, Al Aftah, passed away a short time after being designated as the heir to the Imamate, thus Musa Al Kadhim inevitably inherited the position and becomes the eighth Imam. This would then invalidate the claim that the Imamatehas to be passed down to the first-born son of the previous Imam. Watt emphasizes this group and its role in early Shiite history as they contribute to the orchestration of the theological argumentation concerning one of the most central components of the evolution from Imamate to Ithna ‘Ashariyyah, or Twelver, creed specifically. What is also very compelling is the notion of designating the Imamate from one brother to another rather than to the first-born son. As the Imamate was passed down from Hassan ibn Ali to his brother, Hussain ibn Ali, so to could other Imams also designate their Imamate to their brothers. This is where Watt notices an unusual, yet familiar, result later on in the canonization of the twelve Imams. As Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq appoints his successor to be his son Abdallah al-Aftah, Musa Al Kadhim is then declared the eighth Imam soon after Abdallah’s demise. Watt later poses the same question around the theory of the hidden Imam and whether or not the eleventh Imam, Hassan Al ‘Askari could have potentially declared his brother, Ja’far, as his successor and ultimately the Mahdi himself.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> The issue for Shiite theologians, Watt argues, was how to reconcile the succession of Imam Ja’afar As-Sadiq with the Imamate of Musa Al Kadhim. If the Imamate is meant to be hereditary, then this would pose a difficult challenge for Shiite Imamate scholars in terms of crystalizing what would later come to be Twelver Shiite theology. Having to recognize Musa Al Kadhim as the rightful heir to his father would then require early Imamites to formulate an explanation as to how the process of designation in this particular case was settled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where Watt’s article states the two theological doctrines differ, Madelung, however, initially insists otherwise saying that some historians of Islam have thought of Twelver Shiites and Mu’atazilites to be so closely associated throughout the historical development of both doctrines that they were somehow intertwined. Yet when one examines both traditions more closely, we come to the realization that there were in fact major differences in the fundamental components of each sets of theology mainly revolving around the concept of God’s names and attributes as well as human free will and predestination in addition to the Imamate<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. Madelung then immediately distinguishes the two groups even more and explores the critiques of al-Khayyat, an early Mu’tazilite scholar of the late ninth century, towards the early Imamite Shiites. Madelung states in al-Khayyat’s book, Kitab al-intisar, the Shiites, or Rafidha as al-Khayyat refers to them as, believe</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“that God has corporal limits and shape, that he moves and rests, that his knowledge is produced in time, that he may change his announced decision in accordance with changing circumstances (bada’). They believe that the infidels are compelled to their unbelief by a cause which God creates, that God wills every act of sin and disobedience to his commands. They assert that the dead will be returned to life before the day of resurrection (raj’a), that part of the Koran has been changed, added to and suppressed. They maintain that the Prophet has appointed a certain man as his successor and that the whole community except for a few individuals disobeyed his order. Even a small part of this, al-Khayyat sums up polemically, would exceed the gross infidelity of the materialists (dahriyya) and dualists. Al-Khayyat, writing probably not long after the year 269/882, explains that this has been and is the doctrine of the bulk of the Rafida and their prominent scholars”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, unlike Watt, what Madelung succeeds to do is emphasize the nuances between the Imamiyya and Mu’tazilite intellectual groupsand shows how some of the Mu’tazilite scholars adopted the belief of twelve Imams yet retained their theological doctrine intact. Madelung discusses Al Ash’ari’s account of the combining of two doctrines, Imamiyya and I’tizal, which occurred in the earlier part of the tenth century displaying the exchanging of ideas among theologians which allowed for the cultivation of different creeds, in this case the Twelver creed. A specific example of this that Madelung provides is the tribe which hails from Baghdad of Banu Nawbakht. These were a people who adopted Mu’tazilite creed concerning the attributes and justice of God and human free will yet at the same time rejected any conception of anthropomorphism<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>.Although under the influence of Mu’tazilite doctrine to an extent, the Nawbakhti tribe remained adamant in their Imamite belief. They adhered to the notion of twelve infallible individuals succeeding the Prophet Muhammad. Madelung states “in their doctrine of Imamate they remained, of course, essentially opposed to Mu’tazilism, although they denied, perhaps under Mu’tazilite influence, the possibility of miracles of the Imams, while at the same time endeavoring to prove rationally their sinlessness, infallibility and perfect knowledge of all arts and all languages”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>. On the contrary, what Madelung fails to do, however, is rigorously define the evolution of Twelver belief in hereditary lineage of Imams. His article primarily consisted on the belief in the names and attributes of God, the concept of predestination and free will and the complex relations that the early Imamiyya and Mu’tazilites shared and differed upon. Only towards the end of his article do we see him mention the Zayidi sect of Shiism in which he discusses the framework for which both Shiite schools of thought, Imamiyya and Zayidi, utilized Mu’tazilite kalam, or Islamic scholasticism and philosophy, as a methodology to orchestrate their respective doctrines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">                Ultimately, each of the four authors demonstrate the process of how the designation of the Imamate came to be canonized and how those various processes were at times both definitive and obscure to an extent. Hodgson highlights that a lineage of twelve hereditary imams could not have existed early on as the full lineage of Imams were not alive. He also emphasizes Imam Ja’far As-Sadiq’s reactions to the Ghulat as a means of crystalizing what would evolve into the Twelver creed and how his Imamate and his lineage produced a disciplined process of designation that provided an “ultimate preeminence as the line of imams par excellence”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>. Watt concludes, like Hodgson, that although the notion of Imamate did exist as early as the Abbasid period during Harun al-Rashid’s reign, a definitive form of Twelver doctrine could not have been held until the later part of the ninth century after the death of the eleventh Imam and after the alleged disappearance of the twelfth. Only then, Watt’s states, after Abu-Sahl and al-Hasan ibn Musa of the Nawbakhti tribe had written extensively about the formulation of Imamate in the tenth century, can we finally see an official form of Twelver theology and scholasticism fully come into fruition. What Kohlberg does is draw the distinction between Imamiyya and Itna ‘Ashariyyah (Twelver) yet provides an argument of the smooth transition between the two which allowed for the former to evolve into the latter. He suggests that literature which provided the foundational roots of Twelver doctrine had already existed prior tothe lesser occultation period in the tenth century and had to be brought in line with Imamite dogmatic tendencies through a process of reinterpretation of literature which hinted at the concept of twelve rulers drawn from early Shiite sources and in some cases, Sunni sources. Finally, Madelung emphasizes the process of orchestrating Twelver doctrine was only done through the influence of Mu’tazilite theology and polemics. Through these interactions, different intellectual and theological circles of both Imamaiyya and Mu’tazilite scholars were able to exchange ideas and influence one another yet restricted how much of each other’s doctrines would be adopted.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Background</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a common misconception held by Shias today that Al-Hussain willingly sacrificed himself to save Islam. This view, which is very much romanticized, does not conform to the events that surrounded his <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/">martyrdom</a>. Our statement is not based on a Sunni rendition of events alone, but rather, this is the conclusion that one would come to by studying the original Shia source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we have previously expressed in our article on the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2016/10/24/history-karbala-study-sources/">History of Karbala</a>, the <strong>most correct</strong> rendition of the events that surround the death of Al-Hussain can be found in the work of Abi Mikhnaf. In this short article, we take a look at the evidences that show that Al-Hussain did not know of his impending martyrdom nor did he wish to be sacrificed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Evidences</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>When Abdullah bin Mutee’ asks Al-Hussain about his destination when he fled Madinah, he responded, “For now, I am planning to go to Makkah, as for later, I will make <em>istikhara</em>.” (p. 51)</li>
<li>Before making his journey Al-Hussain speaks about his thoughts about going to Kufa. (p. 49) He says, “I have thought to myself about going to Kufa, for my Shia are there, and the nobles from among them wrote to me to come to them, and I will make <em>istikhara</em>.“</li>
<li>When approached by Ibn Abbas who told him to not leave to Kufa. Al-Hussain responds by saying, “I will make <em>istikhara</em> and then will see what happens next.” (p. 82)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: If Al-Hussain, the infallible Imam with knowledge of the future, had knowledge of what was to occur in Karbala, why would he even revise himself and make <em>istikhara</em>?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Upon receiving the letters from the Kufans, he wrote back, “I will send to you my brother and cousin, who is the most trustworthy from my Ahlulbayt (Muslim bin Aqeel), and I ordered him to write to me about your status, matters, and opinions, and if he writes to me that the lot of you and the notable from among you are upon what was written to me in your letters which I have read, then I will come to you soon<em> insha’ Allah</em>.” (p. 53)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment:  Al-Hussain would not be making a false promise if he knew that he would never be getting into Kufa. Furthermore, he would not have sent his closest and most trusted family if he knew that Muslim bin Aqeel would be let down by the Kufans and eventually killed. This is proof upon proof that Al-Hussain had no idea of this alleged sacrifice.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Hussain left for Makkah right after the death of Mu’awiyah in Rajab, which means that he spent the months of Sha’ban, Ramadhan, Shawwal, Thu Al-Qi’da, and most of Thu Al-Hijjah in Makkah. This is proof that he considered his actions instead of heading immediately to Kufa. His hesitation is evidence that he was not aware of his death.</li>
<li>Al-Hussain writes to the Kufans (p. 87), “I ask Allah to reward you greatly and I have left Makkah on Tuesday on the eighth of Thu Al-Hijjah on the day of Tarwiyah. If my messenger reaches you then hasten yourself and get your act together, for I am arriving to you in these days <em>insha’ Allah</em>.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: These statements from Al-Hussain are clear that he is satisfied with the Kufans and expects to arrive at Kufa soon.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Hussain asks some Kufans, after he makes contact with the troops that were led by Al-Hurr bin Yazeed, about his messenger Qais bin Mus-hir Al-Saydawi. (p. 95) The Kufans tell him that he was killed. Al-Hussain suddenly starts to cry.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: Al-Hussain’s question about his messenger and his reaction are the reactions of one that was surprised by the turn of events.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Hussain attempts to leave Karbala by telling Omar bin Sa’ad and his men to give him three options (p. 102), “Allow me to return from where I came, or to put my hand in the hand of Yazeed and to let him judge what has happened between us, or send me to a Muslim borderline town.” Abu Mikhnaf states that this is according to the majority of the hadithists of his time. The three options that Al-Hussain gives is alluded to later on in a conversion with Al-Hurr bin Yazeed later on as well. (p. 118)</li>
<li>Abu Mikhnaf reports on the same page, from a single chain, that a companion of Al-Hussain denied the above three options, but instead said, “Allow me to leave into this wide land and to see what happens with the people.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: In both scenarios, Al-Hussain is not keen on fighting and is attempting to pull away from the massacre that may soon occur.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>On the 9<sup>th</sup> of Muharram, Al-Hussain sees a dream in which he sees his grandfather – peace be upon him – saying, “You are coming to us.” He tells this to Zainab. (p. 105)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: This is evidence that Al-Hussain had no idea that he was going to get martyred until he saw the dream on the 9<sup>th</sup> of Muharram.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Upon his realization of a likely massacre (p. 108), he tells his companions to take his relatives away, pointing out that the army of Ubaidullah bin Ziyad only wants him. However, his brothers, nephews, children of Abdullah bin Ja’afar, and children of Aqeel insist to stay with him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We comment: This contradicts the commonly held Shia view that he took his family with him with the intention of having them sacrificed along with him.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, there are several obvious points in the story of the martyrdom of Al-Hussain and what led to it that clearly shows that Al-Hussain did not intend to get killed nor get sacrificed. However, stubborn Shias will attempt to twist each of these points and explain them away in a manner to fit their preconceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the objective Shias will realize that there are too many evidences to ignore and that Al-Hussain did not know what was going to happen to him, for they have realized that it is simply not possible to judge all these events as tests, and that the apparent actions of Al-Hussain are to be taken at face value, for history itself has no weight if it is going to be warped by biased minds at every turn.</p>
<p>The tragedy of Al-Hussain&#8217;s martyrdom does not requires exaggerations for it to be considered a tragedy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is an in-depth research into the narrations that list out the names of the Twelve Imams.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is commonly believed by Shias that the names of all Twelve Imams were always known by the Shia community. Even though we have debunked this myth previously <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/02/11/understanding-imamate-early-shia-society/">in another article</a>, in this article, we will take a look at the strongest proofs for this claim. The proofs, obviously, are the narrations that include these lists of Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should come as no surprise to those that have read our article that was referred to above that the concept of <strong>a full</strong> <strong>list</strong> of Imams was foreign to the early Shia society. The most obvious evidence for this is that the Shia kept splitting into different groups every time an Imam died, since they had no idea who the next Imam was. However, it was after the occultation of the twelfth Imam, that Shias had their full list, and it was only then when they had the freedom to fabricate these narrations without fear of falling into error.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Information about the Sources of these Reports</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Shias have the assumption that these reports are plentiful and undeniable, below, we will make readers aware of the origins of these reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most problematic issues with the acceptance of these narrations is that none of them were documented until after the time of the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The earliest of these sources is Al-Kulayni’s Al-Kafi who passed away in the fourth century in the year 329 AH. Al-Kafi, the single most important Shia book of hadith, only includes two narrations in which all the Imams are named, and we shall be examining them further into the article.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second source for these reports is Ibn Babwaih, who is also known as Al-Saduq, whose narrations also deserve to be looked into, due to the man’s weight in Shiasm, and due to the obvious manipulation of hadiths as we shall see below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third and most important source for the narrations of the names of the Twelve Imams is Kifayat Al-Athar by Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi, a student of Al-Saduq, who narrates almost thirty narrations!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be sure to also check out our small section on the narrations of Al-Fadhl bin Shathaan below as well.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Narrations in Al-Kafi</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both narrations are from the Chapter of the Appointment of the Twelve in Al-Kafi.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The first narration is the infamous narration of Ahmad bin Mohammad bin Khalid Al-Barqi from Abi Hashim Al-Ja’afari from Al-Jawad. Luckily for us, Al-Mahasin 2/333, by Al-Barqi has survived, and the same narration can be found within the book, with some variants. It does not include the names of all the Imams. It only includes the names of Ali, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain, and this is evidence of foul play from the narrators that came after Al-Barqi. The narration can also be found in Tafseer Surat Al-Zumar within Tafseer Al-Barqi, and it too doesn’t contain the names of the Imams. Refer to this <a href="http://www.tashayyu.org/ithna-ashariyya/alteration-and-reorientation-of-text-in-twelver-shiism---ii" rel="external nofollow">great article</a> by ex-Shia Macisaac for more on this hadith.</li>
<li>The second narration is the hadith of Bakr bin Salih from Abdul Rahman bin Salim from Abi Baseer that Al-Sadiq told him that Jabir saw the names of the Twelve Imams on a tablet, then he listed the names of the Imams and some descriptions about them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration is problematic due to the narration of Bakr bin Salih who was weakened by Al-Najashi. He is the only narrator who narrated this hadith from Abdul Rahman bin Salim, who was the only person that narrated from Abu Baseer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another problematic issue in the narration is that Abu Baseer was someone that did not know the Imams, as we find in other reports.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>He assumes in the Chapter of Imamate being a Covenant from Allah (hadith #1) that Isma’eel bin Ja’afar is the Imam after Ja’afar.</li>
<li>In the Chapter of the Imams are in the Descendants (hadith #7) he asks Musa Al-Kathim, “What are the signs of the Imam?” Of course, if he knew their names, then he wouldn’t ask.</li>
<li>In the Chapter 33 of Ikmal Al-Deen, he is shocked when Mohammad bin Imran tells him that he heard Ja’afar Al-Sadiq say that there will be Twelve Mahdis (meaning Imams). He forces him to swear by Allah twice that he heard this. Then, Abu Baseer says that he heard this from Al-Baqir, which is evidence that he never heard such a thing from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq. The narration is authentic and shows that Abu Baseer only knew of the number of Imams and not their names.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: The narration in Al-Kafi names the last Imam as MHMD, while other reports from Bakr bin Salih do not include this. This shows that some narrators added the name of the Mahdi into the report, even though it wasn’t originally narrated by Bakr bin Salih.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Narrations of Al-Saduq</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though there was only a generation between Al-Saduq and Al-Kulayni, we do find him having access to many more narrations than Al-Kulayni ever did. It is not reasonable to assume that Al-Kulayni simply overlooked them due to their significance, but rather, it is clear that they were not available to Al-Kulayni in the first place.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Saduq narrates in Al-Faqeeh a supplication during the prostrations of thanks from Musa bin Ja’afar in which all the names of the Imams are mentioned. The same narration can be found in Al-Kafi 3/325 without the inclusion of the names of the Imams. Again, we are seeing a trend. Late works force the names of the Imams into hadiths that were previously circulated without the names of the Imams.</li>
<li>The narration in Ikmal Al-Deen and Tamam Al-Ni’ma p. 253 contains several issues.</li>
</ul>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The first is that the narrator Ja’afar bin Mohammad bin Malik Al-Fazzari was weakened by Ibn Nuh, Ibn Al-Waleed, Al-Saduq himself, and Al-Najashi. Ibn Al-Ghadha’iri accused him of fabricating reports.</li>
<li>The second issue is that the hadith comes through the path of Al-Hasan bin Mohammad bin Sama’a, who is a staunch Waqifi that did not believe in Twelve Imams. He only believed in seven! So how is it possible that he would narrate such a hadith?</li>
<li>In the hadith, Jabir Al-Ju’fi narrates from Jabir bin Abdullah. Anyone familiar with these narrators will know that Jabir Al-Ju’fi was never a student of the great Sahabi, and this is evidence that the fabricator of the hadith made a silly mistake.</li>
<li>The narration explicitly states that Jabir <strong>saw </strong>Al-Baqir, which is a foolish mistake, since Jabir was blind at the time.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Saduq, after quoting the hadith of Bakr bin Salih above, in Uyoon Akhbar Al-Redha 1/50, provides it from an alternative path that include Ja’afar bin Mohammad bin Malik, the fabricator of the previous hadith.</li>
<li>Al-Saduq narrates a hadith in Uyoon Akhbar Al-Redha 1/50 through the path of Abdul Hussain Al-Hasani, however, it comes through unknown narrators like Abu Turab Al-Ruyani, his student, and his student’s student.</li>
<li>Al-Saduq narrates a hadith in Uyoon Akhbar Al-Redha 1/57 through the path of Abdullah bin Abi Al-Huthail which lists the Imams. However, all the narrators in the hadith are anonymous, including Abdullah bin Abi Al-Huthail. It is important to be aware that the narration is not from an infallible Imam, but it is by Ibn Abi Al-Huthail.</li>
<li>Al-Saduq also narrates a hadith in Uyoon Akhbar Al-Redha 2/129 through the path of Al-Fadhl bin Shathaan, however, Al-Fadhl, who died in the year 260 AH, never met Al-Redha. Al-Tusi mentions him as a companions of Al-Hadi, while Al-Najashi says that he narrated from Al-Jawad. Mohammad Redha Al-Sistani points out in his Qabasat 2/194 that Al-Fadhl was a child during the time of Ibn Fadhal, who died in the year 221 AH or 224 AH, which is evidence that he did not hear from Al-Redha who died in the year 203 AH.</li>
<li>Al-Saduq mentions a report in his Ikmal Al-Deen p. 253 in which the Twelve Imams are named. However, it comes through the path of Ahmad bin Bundar, who is anonymous in status. Ibn Bundar’s shaikh, Ahmad bin Hilal is even more problematic, who falsely claimed to be the representative of the Mahdi. The third representative, Al-Hussain bin Rawh, then brought forth a letter from the Mahdi condemning and cursing him.</li>
<li>Al-Saduq’s last narration is also in Uyoon Akhbar Al-Redha 1/62 and comes through the path of Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdul Samad and Mohammad bin Al-Fadhl Al-Nahawi, both of whom are anonymous in status. One can argue the same about Al-Saduq’s teacher Ali bin Thabit as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Narrations of Al-Khazzaz</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the most fascinating, and yet, least credible collection of narrations come through the path of A-Khazzaz Al-Qummi, who was a student of Ibn Babawaih. These narrations were obviously not present among the earlier generations and seem to be mostly have been concocted by a couple of fabricators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first culprit is Abu Al-Mufadhal Mohammad bin Abdullah Al-Shaybani. He alone narrates ten narrations in which the Imams are named, which can be found on the following pages: 11-14, 40-42, 56-60, 74-75, 105-106, 136-138, 166-168, 175-176, 248-250, 266-267. Abu Al-Mufadhal was weakened by Al-Najashi and most of the Shia scholars of his time. Ibn Al-Ghadha’iri accused him of fabricating hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second culprit is Ali bin Al-Hasan bin Mohammed bin Mandah who narrates eleven hadiths that can be found on the following pages: 16-19, 61-62, 69-73, 146-150, 155-156, 162-165, 166-167, 177, 195-196, 232-234, 255-259, 260-263. Ali bin Al-Hasan is unknown in status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khazzaz has some other narrations in which he quotes anonymous sources. These include the hadith of Al-Hasan bin Ali Al-Razi p. 114-118, Mohammad bin Ja’afar bin Mohammed Al-Tameemi p. 304, Al-Mu’afa bin Zakariyyah pgs. 114-118, 244-245, Ahmad bin Isma’eel Al-Sulaymani p. 264-266, Ahmad bin Mohammad bin Abdullah Al-Ayyashi p. 185-186, and Mohammad bin Sa’eed Al-Sayrafi p. 169-170.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khazzaz also quote Ahmad bin Mohammad Al-Jawhari, the author of Muqtadhab Al-Athar. Al-Jawhari himself was weakened by Al-Najahi and his teachers, and is therefore, not relied upon by Shias themselves. Al-Jawhari himself has a couple of narrations in the book of Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi in which he includes the names of the Twelve. Refer to pgs 40-42 and 146-150.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Narrations of Al-Tusi</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike the previous sources Abu Ja’afar Al-Tusi, also known as Shaikh Al-Ta’ifah, was not as significant in influencing the Shia view of the narrations of Twelve Imams.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The first narration of Al-Tusi (in Al-Amali p. 291-292) contains anonymous narrators like Amr bin Yahya, Abdul Rahman bin Abdullah Al-Omari, and Yahya bin Al-Mugheera.</li>
<li>Two narrations can be found in Kitab Al-Ghaybah (p. 147-148 and p. 150) through the path of Ali bin Sinan Al-Mawsili who is anonymous in status.</li>
<li>The narration can be found in Al-Ghaybah p. 136 as well. The narration comes through the path of Mohammad bin Ahmad bin Abdullah Al-Hashimi and Eisa bin Ahmad bin Eisa bin Al-Mansour, both of whom are anonymous in status.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Narrations that have been attributed to Al-Fadhl bin Shathaan</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 11<sup>th</sup> century, a book was uncovered after being lost for centuries upon centuries. That book is called Ithbat Al-Raj’a by Al-Fadhl bin Shathaan. The book contains very clean narrations from Al-Fadhl (d. 260) from his teachers, from the Imams, and they list out the names of the Twelve Imams. This book was only known to have been quoted by Al-Hurr Al-Amili in his Ithbat Al-Hudaat and has not been quoted by anyone that came before him. None of the early sources above quote these clean chains when they were much needed and there is little doubt that this dubious work has been falsely attributed to Al-Fadhl. It is also important to make note that there is no manuscript for this work apart from one that was written in the year 1350 AH, under a hundred years ago, and it was supervised by Al-Hurr Al-Amili himself. (See the printed Mukhtasar p. 68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another issue with the book is that it has arrived Al-Hur Al-Amili through <em>wijada</em>. In other words, he stumbled upon it without knowing its origin. (See the Mukhtasar p. 68)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> A more important reason to question the contents of the work is due to the attributions of those that are not aware of who the Twelve Imams were according to authentic hadiths.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>For example, hadith #5 comes through the path of Mohammad bin Muslim, who in a Saheeh narration in Al-Imamah wal Tabsirah (p. 225) approaches Ja’afar Al-Sadiq when he was sick. He asks him who the Imams is, but Ja’afar never tells him. Instead, he says, that it is someone that can be known from his calmness and serenity. It makes no sense for him to ask Al-Sadiq such questions when Al-Baqir already gave him an answer of who the Twelve Imams were. Furthermore, his student in the narration, Aban bin Uthman was a Nawoosi, who only believes in six Imams, according to Ibn Fadhal in Rijal Al-Kashshi.</li>
<li>Hadith #1 is a narration from the book of Sulaym bin Qais and it adds the names of all Twelve Imams. If we return to other sources, like Kamal Al-Deen p. 284, Al-Ghaybah by Ibn Abi Zainah p. 80, and the book of Sulaym himself p. 184, we only find the names of the Imams until the fifth Imam.</li>
<li>Hadith #4 has the exact same chain as a narration that can be found in Kamal Al-Deen p. 319 (also quoted on Ithbaat Al-Raja’a #8). Interestingly, the narration does not contain the names of all the Imams, but rather, only the first six, while the narration in Ithbaat Al-Raja’a includes the names of all twelve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no authentic narrations with the names of the Twelve Imams in a single hadith. This is a major misconception held by Shias and it is based on a shallow understanding of the history of Shiasm.</p>
