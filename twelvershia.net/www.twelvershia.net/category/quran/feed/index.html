<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h1>



<p>Al-Khoei’s “Al-Bayān fī Tafsīr Al-Qur`ān” is an important contemporary work that many modern Shī`a hold in high regard. However, Shī`ī works that comment on Quranic sciences are often heavily polemical. Al-Khoei’s work is not an exception. Like Al-Kūrānī’s argument that has been thoroughly refuted in a previous article, Al-Khoei presents a report with the intention of arguing that Ahlul Sunnah believe in the permissibility of replacing the words of the Quran with synonyms. In order to argue this, Al-Khoei mentions an event in which Abū Al-Dardā’ allows a man to recite a verse with a different wording.</p>



<p>Al-Khoei then goes on to criticize this position:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If what was intended with this form is that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) permitted the substitution of the words of the Qur`ān with other words that are similar in meaning, which is evidenced by the previous reports, then this possibility demolishes the foundations of the Quran, the everlasting miracle, the established proof upon all mankind, and leaves no doubt that this leads to neglecting the revealed Qur`ān and being careless towards it.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, Al-Khoei is merely attacking a straw man since this has never been acknowledged as a valid Muslim position.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Abu Al-Dardā’ and the Alternative Recitation</h1>



<p>The report has been documented through solid chains of narrations. However, some minor differences must not be overlooked.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>Ibrāhīm narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a foreigner: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em> (the <em>zaqūm</em> tree is the food of the sinner).” The foreigner found difficulty saying: “<em>Athīm</em>,” so he would say, “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm</em> (the food of orphans),” Abū Al-Dardā’ then said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-fājir</em> (the food of the wicked.)”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></li><li>Hammām narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a man: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em>,” but the man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.” </em>So when Abū Al-Dardā’ realized that he doesn’t understand, he said, “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-fājir.”<a href="#_ftn3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em></li><li>Hammām also narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a man: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ṭa’ām al-athīm</em>,” but the man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.” </em>So Abū Al-Dardā’ said: <strong>Say</strong>: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ṭa’ām al-fājir.”</em></li><li>Hammām also narrates: A man recited to Abū Al-Dardā’: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em>.”  Abū Al-Dardā’ said: Say: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-athīm</em>.” The man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.”</em> Abū Al-Dardā’ then said:<strong> Say:</strong> “<em>Ṭa’ām al-fājir.”<a href="#_ftn4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em></li></ol>



<p>The first two reports and the last two have a significant difference. In the first set, Abū Al-Dardā’ is merely saying, “<em>Ṭa’ām al-f</em><em>ājir</em>.” This can be understood as his own explanation. In the second set, Abū Al-Dardā’ explicitly commands the man: “Say: <em>Ṭa’ām al-f</em><em>ājir</em>.” The first set of reports cannot be used to suggest that Abū Al-Dardā’ is teaching a different wording.</p>



<p>In regards to the strength of the reports, they are all authentic, with the exception of the first narration by Ibrāhīm which includes two disconnections. Sa’īd bin Manṣūr reports the hadith from Al-Mughīra, who heard it from Ibrāhīm. However, Sa’īd never met Al-Mughīra, nor did Ibrāhīm hear this report from Abū Al-Dardā’, as the next three reports above indicate. The editors<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> hold the view that both disconnections were caused by scribal errors.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Either way, the report is not problematic since it is more or less identical with the second report mentioned by Sa’īd bin Manṣūr. More importantly, unlike the other reports, the first narration comes through the path of Al-Mughīra from Ibrāhīm, while all the other reports come from Al-A`amash from Ibrāhīm. Hence, it is a strong corroboration to the second report.</p>



<p>With the above in mind, it is hard to say which of the two sets of reports has the correct wording.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Motive behind the Usage of the Synonym</h1>



<p>Assuming that the second wording of the report is correct and that Abū Al-Dardā’ did indeed taught the foreigner to use a synonym, one will naturally wonder about Abū Al-Dardā’s motive.</p>



<p>The second set of reports provide no reason, while the first set provides a context where the man was a non-Arab who was unable to pronounce “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m” </em>due to his accent.</p>



<p>Abū Bakr Al-Anbārī (d. 328) comments on an identical report that mentions `Abdullāh bin Mas`ūd<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> instead of Abū Al-Dardā’: This is not proof for the ignoramuses from the people of deviation to substitute a word of the Qur`ān with another, for this was only done by `Abdullāh to bring the meaning closer to the student in a manner which prepares him to return to what is correct, to use the truth, and speak upon the word that was revealed by Allāh and what was spoken by the Messenger of Allāh (peace be upon him).<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>



<p dir=rtl>لَا حُجَّةَ فِي هَذَا لِلْجُهَّالِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الزَّيْغِ، أَنَّهُ يَجُوزُ إِبْدَالُ الْحَرْفِ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ بِغَيْرِهِ، لِأَنَّ ذَلِكَ إِنَّمَا كَانَ مِنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ تَقْرِيبًا لِلْمُتَعَلِّمِ، وَتَوْطِئَةً مِنْهُ لَهُ لِلرُّجُوعِ إِلَى الصَّوَابِ، وَاسْتِعْمَالُ الْحَقِّ وَالتَّكَلُّمِ بِالْحَرْفِ عَلَى إِنْزَالِ اللَّهِ وَحِكَايَةِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that Abū Al-Dardā’ chose to make the man recite “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-f</em><em>ā</em><em>jir”</em> since the man simply could not recite “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m</em>,” and that his using the word “wicked” as a synonym for “sinner” would at least be more in line with the Qur`ān than man’s current recitation of “the <em>zaq</em><em>ū</em><em>m </em>tree is the food of the orphans,” suggesting that orphans are guaranteed hellfire.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Abū Al-Dardā’s Methodology</h1>



<p>While building theories on a single isolated incident with variant wordings may seem foolish, it comes as a greater surprise that this is done with Abu Al-Dardā’.</p>



<p>When he was in Al-Shām, the people of the city attempted to correct his recitation. They tried to make him recite “<em>wa m</em><em>ā</em><em> khalaqa al-</em><em>ḏ</em><em>akara wal unth</em><em>ā</em><em>,”</em> Q 92:3(and by He who created the male and female) instead of “<em>wal </em><em>ḏ</em><em>akari wal unth</em><em>ā</em><em>”</em> (and by the male and the female). Abū Al-Dardā’ did not give up on the recitation that he was familiar with, nor did he tell the people of Al-Shām that the gist of both recitations were similar. Instead, he maintained his position, saying, “This is how I heard it from the Prophet (peace be upon him),” while resisting those that tried to sway him.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> This is evidence that he only recited the Qur`ān in the one way that he knew how: verbatim.</p>



<p>Abū Al-Dardā’ was someone who memorized the Qur`ān in full during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him).<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> He taught a thousand and six hundred people to recite the Qur`ān in Dimashq alone. He had placed ten of his students to teach ten others and when one of those ten mastered the recitation, he would move up to take directly from Abū Al-Dardā’.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> We do not find a trend in Dimashq of students reciting the words “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-f</em><em>ā</em><em>jir</em>” instead of “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’</em><em>ā</em><em>m al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m”</em> either. All we have is an isolated report about a foreigner that couldn’t pronounce the Arabic.</p>



<p>Abū Al-Dardā’ was so careful with the hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him), that when unsure of the wording, he’d say: “Or something like it,” at the end of the narration, out of fear of attributing to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that which he did not say.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>



<p>Is this who they accuse of teaching the Qur`ān using his own synonyms?!</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Al-Khoei’s hasty attempts to discredit the stance of Ahlul Sunnah, in regards to their view of the preservation of the Qur`ān, has led him to make several mistakes.</p>



<p>He opted to abuse a report that appears controversial even with the existence of another wording. He ignored the fact that the report is speaking about a very specific case that includes someone that is unable to recite the words due to his accent. Finally, his ignorance in regards to Abū Al-Dardā’ the person and his methodology had led him to making a rash conclusion.</p>



<p>To hold the view that Abu Al-Dardā’ held such a belief is unthinkable, especially with evidence as flimsy as that which Al-Khoei had presented.</p>

<p><em><span style="color:#313131" class="color">by Farid al-Bahraini</span></em></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h1>



<p>While `Alī Al-Kūrānī’s “Tadwīn Al-Qur`ān” is nothing more than a compilation of poor polemical points, one specific claim he makes is deserving of attention due to the ambiguity of the quoted phrase when taken out of context. Al-Kūrānī, due to his adherence to the Twelver school of thought, rejects the existence of the seven <em>aḥruf</em>. He refers to the concept as the “Theory of Expansion of the Qur`ānic Text.” Al-Kūrānī attempts to frame the seven <em>a</em><em>ḥruf</em> as a form of distortion.</p>



<p>Al-Kūrānī,<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> in an attempt to argue this position, presents quotations that liken the <em>tashahud</em> to the <em>Qira’āt</em>. He argues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Allāh the Most High preserved His book from the Caliph’s (`Omar) theory of expansion of His text. It only caused a disruption around the Qur`ānic text during his period. However, its remnants remained and bloomed in the school of jurisprudence of our Sunni brethren, which led their jurists to give religious edicts permitting changes in the Qur`ānic text, as well as the text of the <em>tashahud</em> in prayer, due to it being lesser in significance to the text of the Qur`ān!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Al-Kūrānī’s theorizes that Al-Shāfi’ī held the view that one could recite the Qur`ān in a non-verbatim manner, as long as the meaning is not changed. In this article, Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements will be examined within their context, in order to prevent any misrepresentation of his views.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How was the <em>Tashahud</em> Taught?</h1>



<p>Before presenting the statements that Al-Kūrānī quotes from Al-Shāfi’ī it is important to be aware of the <em>tashahud</em> and its nature.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī when discussing the topic of <em>tashahud</em> provides statements from Ibn Mas`ūd and Ibn `Abbās, both of whom explicitly state that the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught them the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way that he taught them the Qur`ān.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>This method was also observed by Companions when teaching the <em>t</em><em>ābi’</em><em>īn</em>. We find identical statements to the above being uttered by Abū Abdulraḥmān Al-Sulamī and Ibrahim Al-Nakha’ī.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>



<p>These statements suggest that the <em>tashahud</em> was learned verbatim. Al-Aswad elaborates by stating that Ibn Mas`ūd would teach them the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way that he taught the Qur`ān, correcting them if they changed something as small as an <em>alif</em> or a <em>w</em><em>āw</em>.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>



<p>Ibrāhīm Al-Nakha’ī states that he was taught the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>



<p>Abū Sa’īd Al-Khudrī mentions that the companions didn’t write what they heard from the Prophet (peace be upon him) with the exception of the Qur`ān and the <em>tashahud</em>.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> This implies that the <em>tashahud</em> was to be memorized by the companions.</p>



<p>These reports clearly show that the <em>tashahud</em> was not taught in the same manner that other <em>ḥ</em><em>ad</em><em>ī</em><em>ths</em> were taught.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Kūrānī quotes Al-Shāfi’ī</h1>



<p>Al-Kūrānī bases his arguments with on following quotations from Al-Shāfi’ī.</p>



<p dir="rtl"><br>وقد اختلف بعض أصحاب النبي في بعض لفظ القرآن عند رسول الله ولم يختلفوا في معناه فأقرهم وقال: هكذا أنزل إن هذا القرآن أنزل على سبعة أحرف فاقرؤوا ما &nbsp;تيسر منه. فما سوى القرآن من الذكر أولى أن يتسع، هذا فيه إذا لم يختلف المعنى!</p>



<p dir="rtl"><br>قال: وليس لأحد أن يعمد أن يكف عن قراءة حرف من القرآن إلا بنسيان، وهذا في التشهد وفي جميع الذكر أخف!!.</p>



<p>The first, from “Ikhtilāf Al-Hadīth”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The companions of the Prophet differed in some of the words of the Qur`ān in front of the Messenger of Allāh, and they did not differ in meaning, and he acknowledged them. He said: ‘This is how the Qur`ān was revealed, in seven <em>aḥruf</em>, so recite in whichever way you find ease.’ So anything apart from the Qur`ān, that falls under the <em>ḏikr</em>, can also be expanded upon, if the meaning is one.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>He (Al-Shāfi’ī) said: ‘It is not for one to purposefully abstain from reciting a <em>ḥarf </em>except due to forgetfulness, while with the <em>tashahud</em> or the rest of the <em>ḏikr</em> it is lesser of an issue.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Al-Kūrānī then quotes Al-Shāfi’ī through Al-Bayhaqī’s Sunan:</p>



<p dir="rtl">فإذا كان الله برأفته بخلقه أنزل كتابه على سبعة أحرف معرفة منه بأن الحفظ قد نزر ليجعل لهم قراءته وإن اختلف لفظهم فيه، كان ما سوى كتاب الله أولى أن يجوز فيه اختلاف اللفظ ما لم يخل معناه!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&nbsp;“If Allāh, due to His mercy upon His creation, revealed His book in seven <em>aḥruf</em>, due to His awareness that memories have weakened, and allowed them to recite it even though their wordings differ, then anything other than the book of Allah is more permissible to have different wordings, as long as its meaning doesn’t change.”<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This quote is taken from Al-Shāfi’ī’s Al-Risāla.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Views on the nature of the <em>Tashahud</em></h1>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī quotes the Companions saying that they were taught the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way they were taught the Qur`ān. This is significant because it suggests that the level of care that was placed into teaching the <em>tashahud</em> was greater than other <em>ḥad</em><em>īths </em>in general.</p>



<p>Anas narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would repeat a statement three times so that it could be understood.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>



<p>If this was the care with his regular speech, then it can only be assumed that the Qur`ān and the <em>tashahud</em> were taught verbatim.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī points out after speaking of variants between the <em>tashahud</em> of Ibn `Abbās, Jābir, Abū Mūsā, and Ibn Mas`ūd that “it is possible that they are all authentic and that the Messenger of Allāh taught groups and individuals the <em>tashahud</em>, and one would memorize one wording while another would memorize a different wording.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">واحتمل أن تكون كلها ثابتة، وأن يكون رسول الله يعلم الجماعة والمنفردين التشهد، فيحفظ أحدهم على لفظ ويحفظ الآخر على لفظ يخالفه.</p>



<p>He also says in Al-Risāla,<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> “All of these are words that intend the glorification of Allah and so the Messenger of Allah taught them.”</p>



<p dir="rtl">كلٌ كلامٌ أريد به تعظيم الله، فعلمهم رسول الله.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī likens the variations of the <em>tashahud</em> to <em>ṣalāt al-khawf </em>(prayers during times of danger). He explains: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“And what he says in the <em>tashahud</em> is but the glorification of Allah, and I hope that all of this is broadly acceptable, and that all the differences within are like what I’ve said, and this – as I’ve said – can occur with <em>ṣalāt al-khawf</em>, <strong>which is sufficient if performed fully in any of the methods that are narrated from the Prophet</strong>.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p></blockquote>



<p dir="rtl">فقال ما في التشهد إلا تعظيم الله، وأنّى لأرجو أن يكون كل هذا فيه واسعًا، وأن لا يكون الاختلاف فيه إلا من حيث ذكرت ومثل هذا – كما قلت – يمكن في صلاة الخوف، فيكون إذا جاء بكمال الصلاة على أي الوجوه روي عن النبي أجزأه.</p>



<p>This statement by Al-Shāfi’ī confirms that the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught multiple ways of praying <em>ṣal</em><em>āt al-khawf</em>, and by extension, also taught multiple wordings for the <em>tashahud</em>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī affirms that these multiple wordings were heard by the Prophet (peace be upon him), who acknowledged their validity, and not that the Companions were given free rein to distort the <em>tashahud</em> as they see fit.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Views on the nature of Al-<em>Qira’āt</em></h1>



<p>Before examining Al-Shāfi’ī’s views in detail, we can come to multiple conclusions in regards to Al-Shāfi’ī’s understanding of the nature of the <em>Qira’āt</em> from the passages that Al-Kūrānī quoted.</p>



<p>Firstly, Al-Shāfi’ī states clearly that one cannot “abstain from reciting a <em>ḥarf </em>except due to forgetfulness”.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In other words, one may not switch out a word with another, add to the Qur`ān, subtract from it, make changes in sentence structure, etc., intentionally.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī’s view is that these recitations were revealed in “seven <em>aḥruf</em>” and that they were “revealed”.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>The apparent meaning of this is that these variants are from Allāh the Almighty. Any other reinterpretation of these clear words would require strong evidence.</p>



<p>In regards to the final quotation by Al-Kūrānī, the passage is taken from Al-Risāla<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> where Al-Shāfi’ī likens the <em>tashahud</em> to the <em>aḥruf</em>, while providing an example of “expansion”. He mentions the narration of Omar bin Al-Khaṭṭāb and Hishām bin Ḥakīm bin Ḥizām, where the Prophet (peace be upon him) affirms that both recitations were revealed by Allāh the Almighty.</p>



<p>If Al-Shāfi’ī’s intention from providing this example was to demonstrate that variant recitations were intentional changes that were based on preferences, then he has chosen the absolute worst example possible.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Imām Aḥmad and the <em>Tashahud</em></h1>



<p>Linking the <em>tashahud</em> with the <em>Qira’āt</em> was not exclusive to Al-Shāfi’ī, and we find an explicit statement by Imām Aḥmad that affirms the previous conclusions above. Ibn Qudāma quotes Imām Aḥmad in al-Mughnī: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I prefer the <em>tashahud</em> of `Abdullāh (bin Mas`ūd), even though other forms are permissible, <strong>because the Prophet (peace be upon him) teaching the Companions different ways </strong>is proof that all are permissible, <strong>and it is like the different <em>Qira’āt</em></strong> that are included in the <em>muṣḥaf</em>.”<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p></blockquote>



<p dir="rtl">تشهد عبد الله أعجب إلي، وإن تشهد بغيره فهو جائز، لأن النبي – صلى الله عليه وسلم – لما علمه الصحابة مختلفًأ دل على جواز الجميع، كالقراءات المختلفة التي اشتمل عليها المصحف.</p>



<p>Even though Imām Aḥmad is not quoting Al-Shāfi’ī, it is not far-fetched that this is a proper representation of the latter’s view, since they were peers, and it is unlikely that both provided the same example without influencing one another.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Comparing the <em>Tashahud</em> to the <em>Qira’āt</em></h1>



<p>The previous sections in this article have already covered the fact that both the variants wordings of the <em>tashahud</em> and the multiple <em>Qira’āt</em> were taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him). If Al-Shāfi’ī’s intention from the comparison was to demonstrate the permissibility of recitation as per the meaning, then such a matter could have been explained using any other statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, the <em>tashahud</em> is unlike most other religious rulings, since multiple variations of it have been taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>



<p>&nbsp;Al-Shāfi’ī explains that the multiple <em>Qira’āt</em> are a mercy from Allah in order to facilitate its memorization. If the Qur`ān was limited to one form in recitation, it would be a struggle for a non-Qurashī to memorize it. Hence, the existence of <em>Qira’āt</em>, through the seven modes, which mainly include dialectal differences, provides ease.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted that much of the <em>Qira’āt</em> have nothing to do with the dialects of the Arab tribes and are incompatible with Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements above. Some of these examples will be examined below.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Non-synonymous Recitations</h1>



<p>Even though Al-Kūrānī’s quotations above are used in order to argue that Al-Shāfi’ī believed in interchangeable synonyms, this doesn’t explain the existence of variants with different meanings. Al-Shāfi’ī, aware of the recitation of <em>wa</em> <em>arjulikum</em> in Q 5:6, comments, “We read it as <em>arjulakum</em>, meaning: Wash your face, hands, and feet.”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī speaks of his preference without critiquing the other recitation as a false one, which demonstrates that he is aware of the validity of variances that do not have the same meaning. In other words, the seven <em>aḥruf</em> are not limited to synonyms as per the view of Al-Shāfi’ī. This conflicts directly with Al-Kūrānī’s understanding of the quotations that he provided.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Taqdīm wa Ta’khīr</em></h1>



<p>The nature of the <em>aḥruf</em> include additions, omissions, non-synonymous changes, as well as <em>taqd</em><em>ī</em><em>m wa ta’kh</em><em>ī</em><em>r </em>(anastrophe), in which a variant includes the same words of a verse but in a different order.</p>



<p>For example, the Uthmanic recitation of Q 50:9: “And the stupor of death with bring truth,” was revealed in one <em>ḥ</em><em>arf</em> as “and the stupor of truth will bring death.” Of course, the latter was not accommodated into the Uthmanic <em>rasm</em> and is not read today.</p>



<p>The example above is clear in the sense that the variant <em>aḥruf</em> are not necessarily synonymous. However, even when they are, word order is always significant.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī points out that one should perform ablutions in the same order as it is mentioned in Q 5:6. Similarly, he argues that one should start the ritualistic rounds between the Al-Ṣafā and Al-Marwa starting with Al-Ṣafā as per the order in Q 2:158.<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>



<p>Thus, according to Al-Shāfi’ī, the replacement of the order of nouns within a verse itself will lead to changes in the way the rituals are practiced and the slightest change in the wording of any verse will have an impact on the meaning.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">An Explicit Statement</h1>



<p>During Al-Shāfi’ī’s description of the obligations of prayer, he makes important statements about Al-Fātiḥa. He states: It is not sufficient to recite “<em>bismill</em><em>ā</em><em>h al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m</em>” after reciting “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amdulill</em><em>ā</em><em>hi rabbi al-`</em><em>ā</em><em>lam</em><em>ī</em><em>n</em>” nor within it, until he returns and recites “<em>bismill</em><em>ā</em><em>h al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m”</em> then starts Umm Al-Qur`ān (al-fātiha) while placing every letter in its position.</p>



<p dir="rtl">ولا يجزيه أن يقرأ (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم) وقرأ من (الحمد لله رب العالمين)، ولا من بين ظهرانيها، حتى يعود فيقرأ (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم) ثم يبتدئ أم القرآن فيكون قد وضع كل حرف منها في موضعه.</p>



<p>He continues: If one forgets “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>” but said “<em>lill</em><em>ā</em><em>hi rabbi al-`</em><em>ā</em><em>lam</em><em>ī</em><em>n</em>”, then returned and recited “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>” and what comes after it, it wouldn’t be sufficient unless he says it in the same way it was revealed.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">وكذلك لو أغفل (الحمد)، فقال: (لله رب العالمين) عاد فقرأ (الحمد)، وما بعدها، لا يجزيه غيره حتى يأتي بها كما أنزلت.</p>



<p>The above is explicit in that Al-Shāfi’ī does not allow one to recite according to their preferences, but rather, the order and the wording that was revealed by Allāh needs to be followed. Replacing words like “<em>al-shukr</em>” a synonym of “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>”, in its place, wouldn’t cut it, since “<em>al-shukr</em>” was not revealed. Saying “<em>al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n</em>” instead of “<em>al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m</em>” would also conflict with his earlier statement.</p>



<p>The statements of Al-Shāfi’ī here are in contradiction with Al-Kūrānī’s understanding of the quotes provided at the beginning of the article. The only way of reconciliation is by holding the view that Al-Shāfi’ī does not believe in an “expansion of the text” as per the desires of the reciters. Rather, he holds the view that the variant recitations are only limited to what was revealed by Allāh the Almighty.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Condition for non-Verbatim Renditions of <em>Ḥadīth</em></h1>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī in Al-Risāla prohibits one from narrating a <em>ḥadīth</em> according to the meaning unless he is aware of what the meaning can lead to, for “if one narrates it according to the meaning without knowing what the meaning can lead to, he may shift what is permissible into a prohibition.”<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">إذا حدث به على المعنى وهو غير عالم بما يحيل معناه: لم يدر لعله يحيل الحلال إلى الحرام</p>



<p>This simple statement refutes the claim that Al-Shāfi’ī allowed the recitation of Qur`ānic verses as per their meaning, since the <em>aḥruf</em> were revealed to facilitate ease in the first place. As per an authentic <em>ḥad</em><em>īth, </em>they were revealed for the “illiterate nation among whom are the elderly woman, the old man, the boy and the girl, and the man who cannot read a book at all.”<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>



<p>In short, most <em>Qira’āt </em>variations exist for the laymen, while narrating a <em>ḥadīth </em>in a non-verbatim manner exists for the educated. This can only make sense if one holds the view that variant recitations were literally revealed by Allāh and not that they were non-verbatim renditions by laymen.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The twisted understanding of Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements cannot be traced to anyone before the year 1997. Al-Kūrānī’s polemical points fall flat due to an intentional misreading of the text and an unfamiliarity of the nature of <em>tashahud</em>.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī, like all scholars of Ahlul Sunnah, believes that the <em>Qira’āt</em> were taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and not some sort of heretical free rein “expansion of text” that Al-Kūrānī attempts to propagate. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Aqa Buzurg al-Tihrani (or Agha Bozorg Tehrani) who died in 1389 AH is one of the major Shia scholars in knowledge and popularity. He is also a student of al-Mirza al-Nuri who believes in the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an as previously explained <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/mirza-al-nuri-tahreef/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the previous article, we saw how al-Nuri -the teacher- insisted on his belief in Tahrif even after another Shia scholar called Shaykh Mahmud tried refuting him in a treatise called &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221;. Al-Nuri went on to author another treatise (in Persian) to refute Shaykh Mahmud, that treatise was not published nor translated but we only know of its contents because al-Nuri&#8217;s student Aqa Buzurg quoted it several times in his encyclopedia &#8220;al-Thari`ah ila Tasanif al-Shi`ah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we will reveal the shocking truth and true beliefs of Aqa Buzurg al-Tihrani the student of al-Nuri al-Tabrasi. What you will read below will make things much clearer so have patience may God preserve you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A- What&#8217;s the position of the student on his teacher who believes in Tahrif?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grand scholar Muhammad al-Husayn al-Husayni says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[His eminence, the lecturer and teacher Aqa Buzurg -his secret be sanctified- is a man of great piety, high morals, discipline, joyful expression and a generous self. He never permitted anyone to dare and attack his teacher, the traditionalist al-Mirza Husayn al-Nuri -son of Shaykh Muhammad Taqi al-Nuri- author of &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221;. He used to defend him in all humbleness and noble character.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ma`rifat-ul-Imam 14/121</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this text, it seems that al-Tihrani was very fond of his teacher al-Nuri and often defended him. However, what will be his position when faced with the dilemma of his teacher&#8217;s writings concerning the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an? Let us investigate further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B- How did the student present the conflict between his teacher and Shaykh Mahmud?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We quote from Aqa Buzurg&#8217;s book the section where he discusses this conflict:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The first doubt cast by the author of &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221; is if the Qur&#8217;anic distortion is proven, then the Jews are justified in saying that both our Books are essentially useless.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our teacher al-Nuri responded to him: This is a verbal fallacy, what I intended by the word “distortion” in my book is other than the literal meaning of that word. Distortion encompasses alteration, change, addition and subtraction, all of which have taken place in the Jewish books. On the other hand, what I intended by distortion, is specifically general deletion of verses that certainly do not contain rulings. As for additions, all Muslim groups have consensus that nothing was added to what is between the two covers, not even  a verse with the shortest eloquent words. Rather, there is an agreement between the people of Qiblah that not a word was added whose location we do not know. So how then can you compare the general deletions we talked about with the apparent meaning of the term? Is this anything other than a verbal fallacy? &#8211; End of the summarized answer to the first doubt.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: al-Thari`ah 10/221</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing we notice is, he seems to be biased towards his teacher. In the sense that he quotes what Shaykh Mahmud says very briefly then gives a lengthy response from his teacher al-Nuri. He makes it so that al-Nuri is the one who has the last word and thus appears to be victorious. Secondly, he refers to the arguments of Shaykh Mahmud in defense of the Qur&#8217;an as &#8220;Shubuhat&#8221; or &#8220;doubts&#8221; which implies that Mahmud&#8217;s stance is incorrect and nothing more than mere doubts whereas the truth lies in the answers of al-Nuri (who insists on Tahrif).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C- Did the student author a book to refute his deviant teacher?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aqa Buzurg authored a book on the subject and named it &#8220;al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahif `an al-Qur&#8217;an al-Sharif&#8221; which translates to &#8220;The subtle criticism in denying the distortion of the holy Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The title of this book clearly implies that it is a refutation of those deviants who believe the Qur&#8217;an is distorted. However, let us look more into this important book to find out the finer details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tihrani explains the purpose of his book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And I have written &#8220;al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif&#8221; in support of al-Nuri. I responded in it to the accusations of the author of &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221; among others.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah 11/188</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(1433: Al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif `an al-Qur&#8217;an al-Sharif) By the author of al-Thari`ah, Aqa Buzurg al-Tihrani. We wrote it to defend our teacher al-Nuri author of &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221; (16:231-232) and to further elaborate on the refutation written by al-Nuri (10:220) against &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab fi `adam Tahrif al-Kitab.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah 24/278</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How confusing&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The title of al-Tihrani&#8217;s book implies that it is written to refute the likes of al-Nuri, yet the way he describes it above clearly suggests the opposite!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>D- How-come his book&#8217;s title conflicts with its contents?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The title says &#8220;denying the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221; yet the book is in defense of al-Nuri and an attack on his opponents. To understand this, we refer to the explanation of Muhammad al-Husayn al-Husayni al-Tihrani who says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (i.e Aqa Buzurg) says: What they accuse him of is related to all forms of distortion, yet he is innocent of this; For he only spoke of the presence of omissions in Fasl-ul-Khitab. He also disproved the presence of any other distortions such as alterations, change and addition.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ma`rifat-ul-Imam 14/121</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaykh Yasin al-Musawi says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Others have tried to support him in various ways, such as his loyal student who strives to defend his teacher and prove his innocence from the accusation of distortion in several locations within his books. Later on he authored a treatise to defend him called &#8220;Al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Najm-ul-Thaqib, words of the researcher pg.68</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The truth is becoming clearer now, it is as if al-Tihrani agrees with his teacher&#8217;s beliefs and aims to support him in claiming that omissions do not constitute a form of distortion or corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E- What does al-Tihrani state in his treatise?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book by al-Tihrani has not been published as expected to avoid some serious scandals. However, we can learn what it contains by checking the words of Shia scholars who had access to it and read it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A detailed description of this manuscript is provided by al-Muhaqqiq Muhammad Husayn al-Husayni al-Jalali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif: I copied it from the handwriting of the author in 1350 AH at his public library in Najaf #1-2 and it was 150 pages, he had written it on 19th Dhul-Hijjah 1384 AH. He begins it with &#8220;Praise be to God who revealed this Qur&#8217;an as an Imam for humanity &#8230;&#8221; and ends it with (&#8230;) He did not include titles to some chapters so I chose to label all of them &#8220;Chapter&#8221; along with enumerations (&#8230;) This book is a comprehensive study regarding the issue of the Qur&#8217;an&#8217;s corruption wherein the author concludes that there are no additions but deletions still took place.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Fahras-ul-Turath 2/495</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the truth reveals itself. Aqa Buzurg does a comprehensive study in 150 pages and reaches the same conclusion as his teacher, that the Qur&#8217;an suffered from omissions when it was compiled by the Companions (ra).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The publisher of the 20th volume of al-Thari`ah writes in the author&#8217;s bio:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif: In this book, the author defends his teacher al-Nuri and his book Fasl-ul-Khitab. He declared his innocence from the accusation of distortion, alteration and change. He even accepted that the Qur&#8217;an suffered deletions.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah, publisher&#8217;s introduction 20/11</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, this further confirms that Aqa Buzurg himself is a believer in Qur&#8217;anic corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>F- Shia scholars hiding the truth.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah Kashif-ul-Ghata&#8217; says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The leader Shaykh Kashif al-Ghata&#8217; wrote a commentary on it and said: &#8220;What I see is &#8230; This treatise must remain a preserved gem and should not be published &#8211; nay, we can maybe say it is impermissible to do so&#8230;&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Fahras-ul-Turath 2/495</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researcher of al-Thari`ah says regarding al-Naqd-ul-Latif:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The text of the commentary on this book which was written by al-Shaykh Muhammad al-Husayn Aal Kashif al-Ghata&#8217; in which he tipped the scale in favor of not publicizing it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah, 24/278 footnote #1</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, the author himself didn&#8217;t care much for publishing it, he says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Sayyid Mahdi bin al-Sayyid Ahmad al-Damawandi who is my brother in law from my wife Mariyam copied from this book. As for my son, he had translated it to Persian (4:143) However we chose to disregard publishing it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah 24/278</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>G-Further evidence that this was a book on Tahrif.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aqa Buzurg usually groups books into categories and an additional evidence that his own book &#8220;al-Naqd-ul-Latif&#8221; is a book proving corruption is that he inserts it among other books that speak of this subject in the following locations of al-Thari`ah: 24/361 &#8211; 24/370 &#8211; 24/278</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other two books he mentions alongside it are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- &#8220;Tafsir Nur al-Anwar wa Misbah al-Asrar&#8221; meaning &#8220;Light of lights and the lamp of secrets&#8221; (No.1951) he describes it as: Its fourth introduction is to prove the omissions from the Qur&#8217;an by the hand of the three individuals especially `Uthman (&#8230;) The author is al-Sayyid Muhammad bin Muhammad Taqi also known as Rida-ul-Din al-Husayni.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- &#8220;Tafsir Nur al-Diya&#8217; al-Kashif `an al-Khiyanah wal-Ikhfa'&#8221; meaning &#8220;Glowing light revealing treachery and concealment&#8221; (No.1988) he describes it as: It proves the distortion of the Book by the hand of `Uthman by al-Mirza abu al-Qasim Muhammad Taqi bin Muhammad Qasim al-Ardubadi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And peace be upon Muhammad and his household and companions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we shall look into the belief of the Shia leader and author of one of the fundamental eight Shia books Mirza Husayn al-Nuri al-Tabrasi (author of Mustadrak-ul-Wasa&#8217;il) who died in 1320 AH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia often deny the fact that this scholar of Hadith believes in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, some even say &#8220;He actually wrote a book to refute Tahreef&#8221; While others say &#8220;He later repented and changed his view after he was refuted.&#8221; In this article we will try to be precise and go straight to the point by proving without the shadow of a doubt that he believed in corruption and insisted on it without any repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this man&#8217;s stance is common and known even to laypeople, we will mainly base this piece on the research already put together by the team at the old &#8220;sunnidefense.com&#8221; (which has been down for a long time).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A- The title of  his famous book.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book in question is of course his famous work called &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab fi Ithbat Tahrif Kitabi Rabb-il-Arbab&#8221; or in English &#8220;The Decisive Speech in Proving the Distortion of the Book of the Lord of lords.&#8221; This title is quite apparent and clearly shows the intention behind the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B- His belief concerning the Qur&#8217;an&#8217;s preservation from his own writings.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia often do a good job of hiding some of their beliefs, you will find them quoting statements by al-Nuri al-Tabrasi such as this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[In this book (i.e Fasl al-Khitab) I prove that what is available and collected between the two covers has remained identical to when it was first compiled during the era of `Uthman; And that it never underwent any change or alteration like previous heavenly books.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah ila Tasanif al-Shi`ah 16/232</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A layperson may read this and assume that the man believes the Qur&#8217;an is intact and preserved. However, the expert will notice that the author simply stated that no further change took place after `Uthman collected the Book. This means that change may have taken place before `Uthman compiled it OR that `Uthman didn&#8217;t even compile it correctly to begin with. This will be made clear by his following statements below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He declares the reason for authoring his book in its introduction by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">هذا كتاب لطيف وسفر شريف عملته في إثبات تحريف القرآن وفضائح أهل الجور والعدوان</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This is a subtle book, a noble compilation, that I have written to prove the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an and the disgraces of the people of tyranny and oppression. I have called it &#8220;The decisive speech in proving the distortion of the Book of the Lord of lords.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Fasl-ul-Khitab pg.2</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another book he declares that `Ali was the first man to compile the Qur&#8217;an then comments by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What&#8217;s apparent is that the compilation of the chief of believers (as) is what is protected and preserved by the infallible household. It is saved until the newer truth (i.e 12th Imam) emerges with a knowledge that does not expire. Unlike the one (i.e today&#8217;s Qur&#8217;an) that is found in people&#8217;s hands; Although it was compiled by (`Uthman) Ibn `Affan as the reports say yet there&#8217;s confusion and shakiness in the way that it (i.e `Uthmani codex) was compiled.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Nafs-ul-Rahman fi Fada&#8217;il Salman pg.233-234</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above, it is clear that he believes the Qur&#8217;an is distorted literally, the crime was done by &#8220;oppressors and tyrants&#8221; meaning the Companions (ra) who compiled Allah&#8217;s Book. He believes `Ali&#8217;s Qur&#8217;an is protected from any change, yet it is preserved with the household until the 12th Imam emerges with the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C- His rank and status among the Shia.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar `Abbas al-Qummi praises him by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The chief of Islam and the Muslims, the promoter of the knowledge of Prophets and Messengers (as), the trustworthy, the venerable, the perfected, righteous, profound and well-informed scholar, the critical and insightful expert in the field of narrations; disseminator of traditions, compiler of composite reports, author of many famous works, a man of overabundant knowledge; the brilliant authority in both narrating and deriving knowledge and the conveyor of the five excellent traits [i.e. patience, faith, obedience, nobility and generosity]; greatest of the symbolic figures. He is more famous than one can mention and above what can be described about him by expression.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Kuna wal-Alqab 2/445</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhammad `Ali al-Mudarris al-Tabrizi says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Haj Mirza Husayn bin Muhammad Taqi bin Mirza Muhammad `Ali al-Nuri al-Tabrasi: He was among the most trustworthy eminent individuals and greatest scholars of the Imami Twelver Shia in the early fourteenth Islamic century; a jurisprudent, scholar of narrations, mentor, commentator, expert in the field of narrator-criticism, devoted worshipper, ascetic, scrupulous and godwary individual; known for his sacred status, scrupulosity, godwariness, worship, and spiritual perfections. He has no match in the science of narrations, commentary (of the Qur&#8217;an) and knowledge of the conditions and layers of scholars of narrations and narrators, and the conditions of the scholars of Islam.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Najm-ul-Thaqib (Introduction of researcher Sayyid Yasin al-Musawi) 1/85</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above we conclude that he is of very high status among his peers and an author of the sect&#8217;s fundamental book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D- Shia scholars admitting al-Nuri believed in corruption.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin with his student al-`Allamah Aqa Buzurg al-Tihrani who describes his teacher&#8217;s book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(912: Fasl-ul-Khitab fi Tahrif-il-Kitab) By our teacher al-Haj Mirza Husayn al-Nuri al-Tabrastani (&#8230;) He proved therein that there is no corruption in terms of: Addition, alteration, change or anything that afflicted heavenly books other than the Qur&#8217;an; not even by a unspecified single word. As for verses not containing rulings, he was of the opinion that deletion did take place by the hands of those who compiled. This happened in a way that we are ignorant of what exactly is missing although they are still preserved with the rightful ones (i.e Imams). Rather, one can generally learn from the detailed narrations he wrote in his book that only deletion is confirmed.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah ila Tasanif al-Shi`ah 16/231-232</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The student is telling us his teacher didn&#8217;t believe the Qur&#8217;an has any additional verses or that verses were changed such as what happened to the Bible and Torah. However, there are missing verses which we do not know but they do not contain religious rulings. The impression he is trying to give here is that the damage is minimal and what he hopes to achieve are two things: A- Give an excuse as to why Ahlul-Bayt are not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. B- Vilify the noble Companions (ra) who compiled God&#8217;s Holy Book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia polemicist `Ali Aal-Muhsin tries to excuse his leader by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Mirza Husayn al-Nuri —May Allah’s mercy be upon him—has many grateful efforts and well-known impacts in regard to the assistance of Islam. And contesting him, and his slip in this book (i.e. Fasl al-Khitab), will neither make us ignore all his efforts nor take away anything from his credibility, for every pious man has a slight fault; for every man of knowledge has a slip. This, is along with the fact that he did not say: &#8220;The Qur’an present in our hands is distorted in terms of addition and deletion,&#8221; rather what he said is: &#8220;Indeed, some words or verses of the Qur’an were omitted from the Qur’an present in our hands.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Lillah Thumma li al-Haqiqah, pg.542</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, he belittles the man&#8217;s sin and describes it as a &#8220;slight fault&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Muhammad al-Husayn al-Husayni al-Tihrani writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The traditionalist al-Nuri authored his book on the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an and intended to only prove distortion through deletion as opposed to change and addition (&#8230;) He -mercy be upon him- wished to affirm deletions in God&#8217;s revealed Book through six arguments.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ma`rifat-ul-Imam 14/118-119</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar al-Hasan bin `Abdullah al-Tabari al-Amuli says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Some folks turned those reports into evidence for the Qur&#8217;an&#8217;s distortion and they judged by their apparent texts that some content was missing. The traditionalist al-Nuri collected them in Fasl-ul-Khitab and considered them proof for the Book&#8217;s corruption and others followed suite.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Minhaj-ul-Bara`ah 16/287</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their big scholar Fadil al-Lankarani criticizes by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As we can see, the traditionalist al-Nuri in-spite of his great status and high rank mentions the verse of preservation in Fasl-ul-Khitab but in the following form &#8220;انا انزلنا الذكر وانا له لحافظون&#8221; To be fair, the fact that he did this —nay, the fact that he originally authored the aforementioned book has broken the back of the Shia.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Tafsil al-Shari`ah Sharh al-Tahrir pg.295</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you go to the Arabic text of the verse above [Al-Hijr:09] you will see it written differently in Arabic &#8220;إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ&#8221; which shows that he couldn&#8217;t even get a basic Qur&#8217;anic verse properly memorized. Ayatullah al-Lankarani complained of the burden al-Nuri placed on the backs of the Shia by openly authoring such a book yet Taqiyyah wasn&#8217;t practiced as much during the rule of the Safavids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E- Opponents of Islam utilizing al-Nuri&#8217;s book.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hujjah Muhammad Hirz-ul-Din writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And his book of &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab fi Tahrif Kitab Rabb al-Arbab&#8221; which I hoped he would&#8217;ve never wrote, because of this book, the tongues of the Jews and atheists grew longer.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ma`arif al-Rijal 1/272</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meaning Jews and atheists used it to verbally attack Islam&#8217;s Holy Book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah Muhammad Mahdi al-Musawi al-Isfahani al-Kazimi writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I wish he had never authored it even though a certain scholar wrote a noble treatise to refute him and clarify the truth. Al-Nuri was thus reviled by the scholars of his time, I was also told by some trusted ones that the Christians translated this book in their languages and published it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ahsan-ul-Wadi`ah 1/72-73</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>F- Did al-Nuri repent after being refuted?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contemporary of al-Nuri, called Shaykh Mahmud bin abi al-Qasim al-Tihrani wrote a treatise to refute him called &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab `an Tahrif al-Kitab&#8221; or in English &#8220;Lifting the uneasiness concerning the distortion of the Book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholars such as Ja`far al-Subhani in Mawsu`at-ul-Tabaqat 1/77 and Al-Hasan bin `Abdullah al-Amuli in Minhaj-ul-Bara`ah 16/266 claimed that al-Nuri changed his opinion after being greatly affected by this astounding refutation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This of course is a lie, al-Nuri stuck to his opinion and used lame excuses as was transmitted by his student Aqa Buzurg after he received that criticism:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I should have called it &#8220;The decisive speech in proving the Non-distortion of the Book&#8221;, calling it by that other name which is used by people was a mistake and it goes against my intention. I only intended to say that some of the Godly revelation was omitted; if you wish, call it &#8220;The decisive statement about the omission of some of the revelation.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah 16/232</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[What is intended by the term &#8220;distortion&#8221; is not what is apparent from this term; distortion means changes, additions and deletions such as what we find in the books of the Jews and others. What I intended by the term &#8220;distortion&#8221; was specifically deletions which have certainly taken place in verses not pertaining to rulings.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Thari`ah 10/221</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, the man plays dumb by saying that he doesn&#8217;t mean the Qur&#8217;an is distorted like other heavenly books but only that it&#8217;s missing some verses!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reality is, the above quotes are taken from a treatise written by al-Nuri al-Tabrasi to respond to his critics, as you can see he insists on his position and claims that it&#8217;s only a difference in semantics and terminology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His treatise was called &#8220;جواب ايرادات ميرزاي شيرازي بر فصل الخطاب&#8221; Wherein a Shaykh from Shiraz asks him to respond to criticisms against Fasl-ul-Khitab. This was obviously published sometime after his original book as mentioned by Aqa Buzurg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though this document is written in Persian and abandoned on the bookshelf of ancient libraries yet we know of some of its content because Aqa Buzurg quoted his teacher&#8217;s rebuttals against Shaykh Mahmud who authored Kashf-ul-Irtiyab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aqa Buzurg mentions Mahmud&#8217;s first argument that Jews can claim our Book is as corrupt as theirs and deny our superiority:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our teacher al-Nuri responded to him: This is a verbal fallacy, what I intended by the word &#8220;distortion&#8221; in my book is other than the literal meaning of that word. Distortion encompasses alteration, change, addition and subtraction, all of which have taken place in the Jewish books. On the other hand, what I intended by distortion, is specifically general deletions of verses that certainly do not contain rulings. As for additions, all Muslim groups have consensus that nothing was added to what is between the two covers, not even  a verse with the shortest eloquent words. Rather, there is an agreement between the people of Qiblah that not a word was added whose location we do not know. So how then can you compare the general deletions we talked about with the apparent meaning of the term? Is this anything other than a verbal fallacy?]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: al-Thari`ah 10/221</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>G- Al-Nuri actually did not retract.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia scholar Muhammad Hadi Ma`rifat comments on what actually took place:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I&#8217;ve heard that Shaykh al-Nuri has retracted his opinion on distortion, claiming that he attempted to prove the non-distortion of the Book found in the hands of Muslims today ever since it was first compiled. Even though, there was change in the original Book revealed to the Messenger (saw) since the compilers lost parts of it (according to al-Nuri).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are his words in his treatise which he wrote as rebuttal to &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221; which was a refutation of &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221; (&#8230;) With this crooked methodology he tried to create a diversion for his opponents (&#8230;) This is a clear contradiction, with crooked words and exposed deception.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Siyanat-ul-Qur&#8217;an pg.105</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief, the man did not retract or repent. If anything he tried to play around with wordings while holding on to his belief in Tahrif.

<p>We begin with Idah-ul-Fara&#8217;id vol.3 pg.202:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">الثالث : وقوع التحريف فى الكتاب لا يمنع من التمسك بالظهور<br />
قوله الثالث : انّ وقوع التّحريف اه‌<br />
اختلفوا فى وقوع التّحريف بمعنى التغيير بالنقيصة بالمعنى الاعم من وقوعه عمدا او سهوا او نسيانا او من جهة عدم الوصول الى ما نزل اعجازا لعدم الحضور وقت نزوله او غير ذلك و عدمه فالمشهور بين الاصوليّين عدمه مطلقا و هو الّذى ذهب اليه جمع من المحدّثين كالصّدوق في اعتقاداته وغيره وذهب الى التّحريف جمع من قدماء المحدّثين كالكليني وشيخه علىّ بن ابراهيم والنعماني وسعد بن عبد اللّه الاشعري والعيّاشي وبنو نوبخت وفضل بن شاذان ومحمّد بن الحسن الشّيباني وعلي بن الحسن بن فضال والشيخ حسن بن سليمان الحلي تلميذ الشّهيد ومحمّد بن علىّ بن شهر آشوب والشيخ احمد بن ابى طالب الطّبرسي في كتاب الاحتجاج وذهب اليه المفيد في المسائل السّروية والمولى محمّد صالح في شرح الكافي والمجلسيان والسيّد عليخان في شرح الصّحيفة والمولي مهدي النّراقي على ما نقل عنهم و ذهب اليه صاحب المستند الحاج ملّا احمد النراقي على ما حكي عنه ايضا وظاهر السّيد الجليل علىّ بن طاوس في فلاح السّائل و سعد السّعود على ما حكي عنه ايضا وهو ظاهر المصنف (يقصد مرتضى الانصاري) في بحث القراءة من الصّلاة وذهب اليه اكثر الاخباريّين وذهب المحقّق البهبهاني في محكي فوائده الى وقوع التّحريف بالنقصان فى غير آيات الأحكام و هو مذهب المحقق القمي في القوانين بل قال فيه بل الظّاهر من بعض الاصحاب دعوى الاجماع على عدم وقوع تحريف و تغيير فى الكتاب يوجب تغييرا فى الحكم و قال شيخنا المحقق (يقصد الاشتياني) قده فى الحاشية وكان شيخنا الأستاد العلّامة (يقصد مرتضى الانصاري) يميل الى هذا القول اى وقوع النقيصة فى غير الأحكام بعض الميل</p>
<p>[Part Three: (The corruption of the Book does not prohibit from holding on to what is apparent from it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His statement (i.e Ansari&#8217;s): &#8220;Thirdly, the occurrence of corruption etc&#8230;&#8221; They&#8217;ve generally differed (i.e Shia) on Tahreef taking place in the form of deletion/subtraction, whether intentionally or due to inattention, forgetfulness and absence during the time of revelation among other possible reasons. What is popular among the Usuli school is that it never happened at all, as is the opinion of a group of traditionalists such as Saduq in his book of I`tiqadat as well as others. As for those who affirmed Tahreef, they are a group from the ancient traditionalists such as Kulayni, his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim, al-Nu`mani, Sa`d bin `Abdullah al-Ash`ari, al-`Ayyashi, the scholars from the clan of Nawbakht, al-Fadl bin Shadhan, Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Shaybani, `Ali bin al-Hasan bin Faddal, al-Shaykh Hasan bin Sulayman al-Hilli the student of al-Shahid, Muhammad bin `Ali bin Shahr Ashub, Shaykh Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi in his book al-Ihtijaj, al-Mufid in his Masa&#8217;il Sarawiyyah, al-Mawla Muhammad Salih in Sharh al-Kafi, the two Majlisis (father &amp; son), Sayyid `Alikhan in Sharh al-Sahifah, Mawla Mahdi al-Naraqi as is reported from them; Also al-Haj Mulla Ahmad Naraqi the author of al-Mustanad as was reported from him, it&#8217;s also what&#8217;s apparent from the venerated Sayyid `Ali bin Tawus in Falah-ul-Sa&#8217;il and in Sa`d-ul-Su`ud as reported, it is also the apparent position of the author (i.e Murtada al-Ansari) from the topic of recitation during prayer in addition to the majority of Akhbari Shia; Al-Muhaqqiq al-Bahbahani in his Fawa&#8217;id was also of the view that corruption in the sense of subtractions did occur but not in terms of any verse containing a ruling, this opinion was shared by al-Muhaqqiq al-Qummi in his book al-Qawanin where he said: &#8220;It appears that some of our companions claimed a consensus that the corruption of the Book did not cause a change in rulings.&#8221; Our teacher al-Muhaqqiq (i.e al-Ashtiyani) said in the footnotes: &#8220;Our teacher al-Ustadh al-`Allamah (i.e Murtada al-Ansari) used to lean somewhat towards the occurrence of deletions in verses not containing rulings.&#8221;]</p>
<p>From the above, the author offers an impressive list of those who believed in Tahreef al-Qur&#8217;an. Even the title of this section implies that it&#8217;s okay to believe the holy Book has been tampered with and corrupted as long as we stick to what&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>In this same book, we flip a couple of pages ahead in vol.3 pg.206 to learn of the view of the commentator himself:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">وامّا الزّيادة فلا ينبغى احتمالها بل لا يجوز لادّعاء جمع من الأصحاب الاجماع على عدمها و ما فى بعض الاخبار عن ابى جعفر(ع)لو لا انّه زيد فى كتاب اللّه و نقص ما خفى حقنا على ذى حجى و لو قد قام قائمنا فنطق صدّقه القرآن فلا بدّ من تأويله و يمكن تأويله بانّ المراد زيادة بعض الحروف فى بعض الموارد ممّا لا يقدح فى المعنى و لا يوجب تغييره وقد ذكرنا فى باب تواتر القراءات و عدمه انّ ذلك ليس بعزيز مع انكار تواتر القراءات بل هو واقع كثيرا و يدلّ على المعنى المزبور ما نقلنا سابقا عن الصّادق عليه السلام انّ القرآن قد طرح منه اي كثيرة و لم يزد فيه الّا حروف قد اخطأت به الكتبة وتوهّمتها الرّجال وفي بعض النّسخ و قوّمتها الرّجال‌</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for additions we cannot entertain this possibility, rather it&#8217;s impermissible to claim it since a group of our comrades mentioned a consensus on its invalidity. As for what was reported from abi Ja`far (as): &#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t added to God&#8217;s Book and subtracted from it, our right would not have been hidden from any sane person.&#8221; and &#8220;When our riser rises to speak (i.e 12th Imam), the Qur&#8217;an will confirm his speech&#8221; These narrations can be interpreted that what&#8217;s intended are only minor additions of certain letters here and there in a way that does not alter the meaning. We had mentioned in the chapter of the mass transmission of recitations that this isn&#8217;t too much to ask, especially if we deny the mass transmission of the recitations, rather it happens often according to what we narrated from al-Sadiq (as) that &#8220;Many verses were dropped from the Qur&#8217;an but only minor letters were added to it due to scribal errors.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Above we see him quoting the Imams to confirm Tahreef yet he shows objection to any major additions to the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">قد ذكرنا انّ اصل وقوع التّحريف فى آيات الاحكام ممنوع وانّ الاخبار الواردة فى ذلك لم تبلغ مبلغ الحجّية وانّ المتيقّن من الاخبار المذكورة الّتى هى عمدة دليل القائلين بالتّحريف هو سقوط اسماء الائمّة عليهم السّلام خصوصا امير المؤمنين عليه السلام و اسماء المنافقين او هو مع سقوط بعض الكلمات او الآيات فى القصص و الامثال فقط لا الاحكام مع انّ الأئمّة عليهم السّلام قد امروا بالعمل بهذا القرآن فى رواية سالم بن سلمة و غيرها بل قد نقلنا عن العلّامة المجلسىّ انّ اذنهم عليهم السّلام بل آمرهم بالعمل بهذا القرآن معلوم متواتر مع انّ اخبار العرض على الكتاب المتضمّنة لأمر الأئمّة بعرض مطلق الاخبار او الاخبار المتعارضة على الكتاب الموجود بايدينا تدلّ على حجّيته بل على عدم اختلال ظواهره بسبب من الاسباب و الّا فلا معنى للعرض على المجمل كما هو واضح بادنى التفات‌</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We previously mentioned that the basis of the belief in Tahreef is not related to verses of laws and that the narrations containing this meaning are not binding proofs. Those familiar with the evidences of the believers in Tahreef know that they revolve around the deletion of the names of our Imams (as) especially the chief of believers (as) as well as the names of hypocrites, some expressions and verses contained in certain stories but not the rulings. Although the Imams (as) have ordered us to work with this current Qur&#8217;an like in the narration of Salim bin Salamah and others. Rather, we quoted al-`Allamah al-Majlisi saying that they (as) permitted us to work with it in mass recurring reports; It is also known from the reports that order us to present any conflicting narrations to this available Book in our hands, such reports show the Qur&#8217;an as binding proof for us and that the apparent meanings contained in its text are not corrupted otherwise there&#8217;s no reason to present anything to it as is clear.]</p>
<p>He finally concludes that even though it&#8217;s corrupt, yet corruption does not affect rulings nor does it alter the meaning of the available texts, thus we can still use this corrupted Qur&#8217;an to worship and present any conflicting narrations to it. Truly, a student of Majlisi!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon our readers, in this short article we will show that Prophet Ibrahim (as) was demoted as opposed to be promoted according to Shia beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/the-footprints-of-prophet.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3947" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/the-footprints-of-prophet-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/the-footprints-of-prophet-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/the-footprints-of-prophet.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article centers around the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>{And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, “Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.” [Abraham] said, “And of my descendants?” [Allah] said, “My covenant does not include the oppressors.”}</strong><b> </b><strong>[2:124]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia believe that prophet Ibrahim (as) was promoted in this verse to the rank of &#8220;Imam&#8221;. The Shia also claim this verse restricts leadership to those who are infallible but we have discussed this in detail in our article &#8220;<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2013/08/15/verse-of-imamat-ibrahim-shia-understanding-of-oppressors-is-it-qati-or-dhanni/" rel="external nofollow">Verse of Imamat Ibrahim: Shia understanding of “Oppressors”, is it Qat`i or Dhanni?</a>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We begin by citing our evidence from Shia books as to why we reached this conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence 1: Shia believe their Imams to be greater than the prophets of God.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi says in “Bihar al-Anwar” vol.26 pg.82:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[On the whole, after admission of the fact that the Imams are not prophets, we are bound to acknowledge the fact that they are superior to all Prophets and legatees except our Prophet salutations and peace upon him and his family.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nasir Makarim al-Shirazi says when explaining the verse 124 from the chapter “al-Baqarah” in his book “al-Amthal”:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It becomes clear from the verse that the rank of Imamah that was bestowed upon Ibrahim after all these tests is superior to prophets and messengers (…) as the position of Imam is higher than what he mentions, even higher than prophet-hood and the message-hood]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So according to them, prophet Ibrahim (as) was promoted to this special rank called &#8220;Imamah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence 2: Shia scholars admit there&#8217;s no real difference between a Prophet and an Imam.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi says in “Bihar al-Anwar” vol.26 pg.82:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[To our knowledge there is no reason not to describe the Imams as Prophets except consideration to the status of the Final Prophet. Our intellect too, cannot perceive a distinction between prophet-hood and Imamah.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufid says in “Awa’il al-Maqalat” pg.45:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[ 8- The difference between the Prophets and the Messengers (as):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Imami (Shia) have consensus that every messenger is a prophet but not every prophet is a messenger. From the prophets of Allah are those who preserve/protect the religious laws passed down by the messengers, they are their successors in this matter. The religious law only prohibits us from claiming prophet-hood for our Imams although the intellect does not conflict with this, because the Imams have acquired all we&#8217;ve discussed from the qualities of the prophets peace be upon them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In short, after using their intellect they couldn&#8217;t find any special difference to distinguish between a prophet and an Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence 3: The only minor difference cited was in favor of prophets.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In al-Kafi 1/176 #1 as authenticated by al-Majlisi from Zurarah: I asked abu Ja`far (as) &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a Messenger and a Prophet?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;A prophet can only see (the angel) in his dreams and hear their voices but he cannot see the angel while awake. A messenger can hear the voice, see in the dream as well as while awake.&#8221; I asked:&#8221;What is the position of the Imam?” he (as) said: “He hears the voice but does not see or observe the angel.” Then he recited the following verse of the Holy Quran: {Satan would try to tamper with the desires of every Prophet or Messenger or Muhaddath whom We sent}.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a summary of the differences between a Messenger (Rasool), Prophet (Nabee), and Imam (Muhaddath).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Messengers: They see &amp; hear the angel whether they are asleep or awake.<br />
-Prophets: They see &amp; hear the angel while asleep, but when they are awake they can only hear.<br />
-Imams: They can ONLY hear the reports, but they DO NOT see the angel whether they are asleep or awake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibrahim (as) according to Shia was demoted from the status of Messenger who can see and hear the angels to the status of Imam who cannot see the angel neither in dreams or consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THE SUNNI POSITION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahlul-Sunnah do not believe the Imamah discussed in the verse of Ibrahim (as) is related to a promotion of rank such as &#8220;colonel&#8221; or &#8220;general&#8221;, this is because the word Imam simply means &#8220;leader&#8221; and all prophets in our belief are leaders by default. Believing otherwise is simply preposterous!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So is this verse useless or random? No, this verse is honoring Ibrahim (as) and informing him that instead of being a prophet that leads his own community or tribe, he shall be leading &#8220;the people&#8221; in general. Thus Ibrahim (as) is a leader to be followed by all humanity, this is why in the Qur&#8217;an we are ordered to follow the example of our leader Ibrahim (as) not of Yunus (as) or any other divine guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Then be patient for the decision of your Lord, [O Muhammad], and be not like the companion of the fish (Yunus)} [68:48]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The examples are many and we list the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself.} [2:130]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Say, &#8220;Allah has told the truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of the polytheists.&#8221;} [3:95]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate with Allah.} [16:123]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SOME SHIA ARGUMENTS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if Shia argue and claim that all leaders in the Qur&#8217;an are divinely appointed and thus it is the rule and non-appointed leaders cannot be accepted?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia like to argue &#8220;Bring us a verse of the Qur&#8217;an where Imams were not appointed by God.&#8221; To which we counter and say &#8220;Bring us a verse from the Qur&#8217;an where a non-prophet was appointed as Imam&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the verses talking about evil Imams and the above-mentioned verse of prophet Ibrahim (as) being an Imam. We have the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{We gave him, in excess, <strong>Isaac</strong>, and <strong>Jacob</strong> (for a grandson); and We made each righteous &#8211; and appointed them <strong>Imams</strong> to guide by Our Command and We revealed to them to do good deeds, and to establish the prayer, and the giving of charity, and they were for Us worshipers.} [21:72-73</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the only verses that specify by name individuals who were called &#8220;Imams&#8221;, what they all have in common is that they were all prophets. Therefore, we can argue that the Qur&#8217;an teaches that ONLY prophets can become Imams and thus `Ali and his progeny are out of the folds of Imamah since they aren&#8217;t prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if Shia argue that Talut was appointed although he was not a prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We say, Talut according to you folks was not an Imam rather he was a Malik(King).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Their Prophet said to them: &#8216;Allah has raised Saul(Talut) to be your <strong>king</strong>&#8216;} [2:247]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And peace be upon Muhammad and his nation.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Meaning of Rijs in (33:33)</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those the Shias that have dared to ask themselves: “What does Rijs mean?” We decided to write up a short article that answers the question. Unlike <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/05/03/ayat-al-tatheer/">our previous article</a> that was a general refutation to the Shia understanding of the verse, in this article, we have decided to refute the Shia stance by quoting Ahlulbayt in an authentic Shia hadith in order to expose the extreme bias of Shias apologists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>The Misconception of Modern Shias</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, Shia apologists have made the mistake of assuming the meaning of Rijs due to their preconceptions. Below, we have included some of these assumptions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2163:ayah-al-muwaddah-a-new-analysis&amp;catid=169&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=115" rel="external nofollow">Guided</a> (Wilayat.net): Allah kept all <em>rijs</em> away from the Ahl al-Bayt (as). <em>Rijs</em> INCLUDES sin, IGNORANCE, mistake, error and all other negative attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://umar-ibn-khattab.blogspot.com/2013/11/fadak-inheritance-that-wasnt.html" rel="external nofollow">Umar-ibn-khattab blog</a>: Reading the verse of purity, and Hz Fatima&#8217;s (AS) inclusion in it, it can be concluded that she was pure from all rijs, all worldly and materialistic pleasures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://valiasr-aj.com/english/mobile_shownews.php?idnews=284" rel="external nofollow">ValiAsr-aj.com:</a> Allah only wishes to remove al-Rijs (evil deeds and sins, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/fadak/abu-bakrs-rejection-witnesses-testimony.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen.com</a>: In the verse under discussion, Allah (swt) makes it clear that the Ahl’ul bayt (as) are those individuals that are exempt from all forms of Rijs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meaning of Rijs According to Ahlulbayt</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon returning to Shia books of hadith, we found that Al-Rijs does not mean any of the general meanings that have been provided above. Ja’far Al-Sadiq explains, “<strong>Al-Rijs means doubts,</strong><strong> I swear by Allah that we never doubt in our Lord.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration can be found in Al-Kafi. It is the first hadith in the chapter entitled: The Chapter of the Appointment by Allah and His Messenger of the Imams (as) One by One.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration was graded as authentic by Al-Majlisi, Al-Khoei, and Al-Bahbudi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: In the links above, one will find that the authors of the articles have included the term “uncleanliness” between parentheses. This cannot be found in the original Arabic, of course. We humbly suggest that they change the word between parentheses to “doubts” in order to fit in with the teachings of their “infallibles.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible Counter-Argument and Rebuttal</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Shia apologists might argue that the term Rijs encompasses all the meanings and should not be restricted to one meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Response: We strongly disagree with the suggestion, for there are no authentic narrations from Ahlulbayt that provide an alternative or a general meaning. Secondly, it is forbidden according to Shiasm for one to dismiss the specific interpretation of the Imam by turning a specific meaning into a general one. Nothing prevented the Imams from saying, “All sins / errors,” instead of “doubts&#8221; in the first place. So Shias should not put words into their mouths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Some Sunnis include a general meaning for Rijs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Response: Shias don’t take knowledge from Sunni books, especially in presence of the “authentic” narrations of “infallibles”. It is about time that Shias stop referring to Sunni books in order to affirm their own preconceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq, &#8220;removing Al-Rijs&#8221; has nothing to do with infallibility. Rather, it is a matter of having one&#8217;s doubts removed.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Intellectual Dishonesty of Al-Khoei<br />
</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is mostly taken for granted by students of knowledge the amount of effort that modern scholars and editors invest in their works. One of their tasks, the quoting of earlier works in the way that was intended by the original author, is one of their main responsibilities. That is because the reader trusts the modern scholar enough to not return to the original source. Due to this, when a modern scholar provides the reader with incorrect quoted information, the modern scholar is cheating the reader’s faith and trust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is with the above in mind that we would like to share with readers an example of Al-Khoei’s intellectual dishonesty.</span></p>

<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Why did Al-Khoei Rely on the Mistake?</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Background: The Status of Zurarah</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zurarah bin A’ayan is one of the top Shia narrators. He is excessively praised by early Shia scholars and we can find several reports in Shia books in which the “infallible” Imams praise him greatly. However, we also find reports from the same Imams in which he is severely condemned. This is especially problematic because both groups of reports are authentically attributed to the Imam (by Shia standards).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of being cautious and rejecting Zurarah’s reports due to the vagueness of his status in the eyes of the Imams, the Shias chose to take a different approach. They theorized that the Imam condemned Zurarah in order to make him look like an enemy, in order to protect him from their foes that would target the students of the Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though this theory is far-fetched, it is a much preferable option to Shias than to reject Zurarah’s narrations, since he truly narrates a very large number. His narrations amount to 2,490 in the four books according to Al-Khoei 8/254.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">What also supports this far-fetched theory was the following concocted narration:</span></p>

He quotes:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I (Ja’far Al-Sadiq) only attacked you (Zurarah) in order for them to praise you in your religion, due to your flaws, and this would be used for prevent them from harming you. Allah – glory be to Him – said, ‘As for the boat, it belonged to poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized <strong>every boat by force.</strong>’ (Surat Al-Kahf: 79) This is how it was revealed by Allah: <strong>Fine.</strong>”</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I (Ja’far Al-Sadiq) only attacked you (Zurarah) order for them to praise you in your religion, due to your flaws, and this would be used for prevent them from harming you. Allah – glory be to Him – said, ‘As for the boat, it belonged to poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized <strong>every <u>fine</u> boat by force</strong>.’ (Surat Al-Kahf: 79) This is how it was revealed by Allah: <strong>Fine.</strong>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Refuting a Possible Shia Excuse</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shias might say that Al-Khoei relied on an early edition of the book that did not include the term: “fine”, as part of the verse in Surat Al-Kahf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We agree. This is obviously the case. Al-Khoei relied on a flawed print of the book <u>purposefully.</u></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3619 alignright" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-150x150.jpg" alt="murtadha-askari" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-askari-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3620 alignright" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-150x150.jpg" alt="murtadha-cover" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/murtadha-cover-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Murtadha Al-Askari in his Al-Qur’an Al-Kareem wa Riwayat Al-Madrasatain 3/499 points out that there are two editions of the book, one that was printed in Bombay and another that was printed in Iran. The former does not include the word: “fine,” while the latter does.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei himself states in 10/309 of Mu’jam Rijal Al-Hadith that he relies on both editions of the book and we find him often speaking of discrepancies between the versions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note<em>: It is important to keep in mind that the editors of Al-Kashshi (p. 9) stated that the Bombay edition is one that is filled with mistakes to the extent that readers, at times, would not be able to make sense of what was written. They went on to say that the best version of the work is Al-Qahba’ee’s copy.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, Al-Qahba’ee’s Majma’ includes the word: “fine,” as part of the verse as well.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why did Al-Khoei Rely on the Mistake?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei found himself torn between accepting a narration that benefited Shiasm greatly, while at the same time it conflicted with his views about the Qur’an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3617 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-150x150.png" alt="khoei2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-62x62.png 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khoei2-184x184.png 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>We find in 8/253 that Al-Khoei authenticates the report above and uses it to explain away all the narrations in which Zurarah is condemned by the Imams. The narration is the foundation of Shia argument that explains away all the negative reports as “taqiyyah.” Therefore, it was extremely important to highlight it and make its authenticity known.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, the narration included a recitation of the Qur’an by the Imam that is not accepted by Al-Khoei. Since Al-Khoei does not believe in abrogation or variant readings, as we have established in <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/09/19/response-to-the-collection-and-preservation-of-the-quran/" rel="external nofollow">another article</a>, accepting the word: “fine”, as part of the verse, would mean that the Qur’an that we recite today has been tampered with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei, as most Shias know, does not endorse the view that the Qur’an has been tampered with.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khoei, desperate to have his cake and eat it, found his salvation in an erroneous version of the text. It did not matter if it was based on a corrupted print of Rijal Al-Kashshi, nor does it matter if the text has a clear error that is obvious from the context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">All that mattered was that it fit his ideology and that it explained away the negative narrations about Zurarah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavyweight of the Shia, their leader and the author of one of their eight main Hadith books, al-Hurr al-`Amili is no doubt from the top Shia scholars of Hadith and has earned the utmost respect by the followers of this sect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This man comes as no surprise since he is the most outspoken of all Akhbari Twelver Shia scholars and we all know their stance regarding Allah&#8217;s book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s dive right into his books and expose his deviance to the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his book &#8220;Ithbat-ul-Hudat&#8221;, after mentioning three reports where the Imams claim their names were present in the Qur&#8217;an before it was changed, he commented saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">أقول: هذه الأحاديث و أمثالها دالة على أن النص على الأئمة عليهم السّلام و كذا التصريح بأسمائهم و قد تواترت الأخبار بأن القرآن نقص منه كثير و سقط منه آيات لما تكتب، و بعضهم يحمل تلك الأخبار، على أن ما نقص و سقط كان تأويلا نزل مع التنزيل، و بعضهم على أنه وحي لا قرآن، و على كل حال فهو حجة في النص و تلك الأخبار متواترة من طريق العامة و الخاصة</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">[I say: These narrations and their likes are evidence that the textual appointment of the Imams (as) in addition to their names (were present), and the narrations have reached mass transmission (Tawatur) in declaring that much was lost from the Qur&#8217;an and that verses from it were dropped without being written. Some consider these reports to be referring to explanations that descended alongside the revelation while some consider it as revelation but not a part of the Qur&#8217;an. Either-way, the text is valid proof and those narrations are mass transmitted by the general Muslims and the Shia.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ithbat-ul-Hudat 2/206</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above, he is saying that some verses were lost and removed for sure. Then he gives some of the interpretations of those who don&#8217;t believe in its corruption. Finally, he concludes that no matter what the case, the Qur&#8217;anic text is still valid even if some verses are missing, and that the reports of corruption are mass-transmitted thus undeniable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same book while copying some texts from Rabi`-ul-Abrar by al-Zamakhshari, he writes the story of how the Qur&#8217;anic verses were lost:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و روى أيضا أحاديث كثيرة في الطعن على عثمان، تركناها اختصارا، منها: ما تضمن أنه جمع الناس على قراءة زيد بن ثابت خاصة، و أحرق المصاحف، و أبطل ما لا شك فيه أنه منزل من القرآن‏</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[And he (i.e al-Zamakhshari) narrated many reports criticizing `Uthman but we left it for the sake of brevity. From them: Is that he gathered the people upon the recitation of Zayd bin Thabit and burned the Masahif thus destroying what were undoubtedly revealed Qur&#8217;anic texts]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Ithbat-ul-Hudat 3/380</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When he says &#8220;destroying&#8221; he means that those verses are lost to no return because of `Uthman. Indeed, the fact that `Uthman compiled the Qur&#8217;an into book form has turned many Shia away from it due to their hatred of Umayyads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to learn more about his belief, we turn towards a more specialized book. A treatise by the name of &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; written by al-`Amili.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you&#8217;re going to find it odd, that a person who believes in Tahrif would have a book aiming to prove the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an. The title of the book &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; implies that the author wouldn&#8217;t be from those who believe in Tahrif, nonetheless let&#8217;s read what the researcher of the book al-Sayyid Muhammad Hadi Karami says in the introduction pg.21 while discussing the contents of the book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Then the Shaykh (i.e al-`Amili) mentioned that the presence of deletion (in the Qur&#8217;an) does not oppose the fact that what&#8217;s present from it (today) is mass transmitted nor does believing in this (i.e deletion) cause harm. What opposes the mass transmission (of the Qur&#8217;an) is the presence of additions and distortions.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There you have it folks! According to the researcher&#8217;s summary, al-`Amili proves that the Qur&#8217;an is mass transmitted even though the Companions removed verses of `Ali&#8217;s merits. The deletion of verses does not constitute any harm when it comes to Tawatur, only additions are problematic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, when al-`Amili is talking about Tawatur, he isn&#8217;t talking about the mass transmission of the Qur&#8217;an as it was revealed to prophet Muhammad (saw). Since as you know he believes verses are missing, he&#8217;s mainly talking about the mass transmission of `Uthman&#8217;s official Qur&#8217;an after those verses were dropped and after the official version was spread in the lands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researcher makes sure to highlight this point on the same page:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[It&#8217;s no secret, that the debate revolves around the mass transmission of this Qur&#8217;an from the Prophet (saw) not its mass transmission from those who had later collected it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s move to al-`Amili&#8217;s own words and see if the researcher got it right, he says on pg.31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Mixing both additions and deletion when discussing this matter is not good. Because the deletions, in case they did actually occur, do not oppose the mass transmission of what is present today. We are only discussing the amount that is found in the Book now, is it mass transmitted or not? Does it contain additions, distortions and alterations or not? No doubt it is mass transmitted today.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice the author refuses to discuss deletions, he says they aren&#8217;t harmful and the discussion is only concerning the verses that survived today in the Qur&#8217;an, have they reached us through Tawatur or not? He says if they did, then it is evidence that no additions or distortions took place in our Qur&#8217;an, yet he never mentions deletions as if it isn&#8217;t a big deal if our Qur&#8217;an lost verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili then quotes al-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Damad on pg.40, al-Damad quotes the verse about Allah promising to protect the revelation and comments that it is an evidence against those who believe the Qur&#8217;an contains additions or that parts may be corrupted and replaced with others, also its order and arrangement. However, when he reaches the part about &#8220;deletion&#8221; Damad says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Regarding verses being left behind, or being dropped after they were revealed, the majority of our companions allow this and a few of the commoners as well. The majority of the mainstream (Muslims) prohibit this completely although the narrations in our books and theirs are plentiful in stating that these deletion did in fact take place generally.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ِAl-`Amili then writes that the Muslims had unquestionably transmitted the Qur&#8217;an and that even if the Muslims had certain motivations to remove or hide certain verses, then this is restricted to a small portion of the Qur&#8217;an not all of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili then quotes two narrations about how `Ali collected the full Qur&#8217;an and how the Companions rejected it. Then `Umar began collecting the Qur&#8217;an by bringing at least two witnesses for every verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili comments on the narrations pg.68:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[I say: I learned from these two narrations and their likes, that they (as) ruled that this Qur&#8217;an is truthful, all of it is correct without any additions or distortion. However, what is understood from the two reports regarding the deletion, is possibly concerning the interpretation that descended alongside the revelation and there&#8217;s quite a few clues for this, Or it could be that it&#8217;s concerning the revelation that isn&#8217;t part of the Qur&#8217;an as al-Saduq previously stated. It is also possible that it refers to abrogation among other possibilities. What is apparent from the second report is that the deletion was related to what contained the scandals of those folks including the textual appointment of the Imams. The presence of those texts would have exposed their disobedience and so no doubt nothing more than these kinds of texts were dropped. This however does not negate the mass transmission of what was dropped (from verses) let alone what is still present. The reason that they (i.e Companions) requested two witnesses (for each verse) instead of one, was simply a ruse and a scheme on their part, due to the prevalence of Taqiyyah and the number of hypocrites who support them (i.e supported Abu Bakr and `Umar) as well as the small number of their opponents who were siding with the chief of believers (as). It&#8217;s sufficient for you to know that they were followed by countless thousands whereas the chief of believers (as) only had the support of four people, this makes things clear.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the above he lists various possibilities for what was dropped and that it might be interpretation or revelation. Then he says that the second narration hints that certain verses were indeed dropped and they would have exposed Abu Bakr and `Umar if they remained. This is why Abu Bakr and `Umar, when collecting the Qur&#8217;an, placed a condition that any verse that must be written needs two witnesses. By doing so, they got rid of all verses related to the Imam&#8217;s appointment as he and his supporters couldn&#8217;t speak since they were in Taqiyyah, thus those verses were not written due to the absence of witnesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-`Amili states that the Qur&#8217;an was mass transmitted during the time of the Prophet (saw) and that the Companions had all verses written, however he doesn&#8217;t mean that this proves that no verses were lost later, because he states right after that this was the case until `Uthman burned them as if to hint that it was mass transmitted until `Uthman destroyed the evidence by force. On pg.99:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[No doubt that the people had many copies written (of verses) and the original copies remained preserved in written form with those we mentioned out of precaution in order to guard the Qur&#8217;an at least until the reign of `Uthman.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you will learn why al-`Amili was only addressing additions and distortions yet avoiding deletions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another book while disputing with another scholar&#8217;s evidences he said about the Qur&#8217;anic verses pertaining to lawful foods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">وقد تواترت الروايات بأنه لم يجمع القرآن كله الا الأئمة عليهم السلام وان من أدعى انه جمعه كله فهو كاذب. وورد النص الصحيح بأن القرآن الذي نزل على محمد صلى الله عليه واله كان سبعة عشر ألف آية. والموجود الان نحو الثلث باعتبار العدد. ويحتمل كون تلك الآيات أطول من الآيات الموجودة ويكون الموجود منه هو العشر او اقل وتواتر النص بأن المهدي عليه السلام اذا خرج يخرج القرآن بتمامه فينفر أكثر الناس منه ولا يقبله الا القليل. فكيف يقال : ان جميع المحرمات قد فصلت لنا في هذا القرآن الموجود ليمكن الحكم باباحة ما ليس فيه وهذا لا يتم الا على طريقة العامة وهذا الاستدلال لا يليق صدوره عن أحد من العقلاء فضلا عن الفضلاء</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The narrations mentioning that the entire Qur&#8217;an was only collected by the Imams (as) have reached mass transmission (Tawatur) and that whoever claims to have collected it has lied. The authentic text has also reached us that the Qur&#8217;an revealed to Muhammad (saw) was seventeen thousand verses whereas the one available today is only a third of this number. It is possible that those (missing) verses are longer than the ones present and so what&#8217;s available could be a tenth or less from the actual size. It&#8217;s also been mass transmitted that the Mahdi (as) when he emerges, shall bring out the complete Qur&#8217;an but the people will be repulsed by it while only a minority accept it. How then could it be said: &#8220;All prohibited foods have been specified for us in this present Qur&#8217;an and so everything not mentioned therein is lawful.&#8221; This can only be correct according to the methodology of the mainstream Muslims (Sunnies) but this can&#8217;t be considered as binding proof to any sane person let alone a virtuous one.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Fawa&#8217;id al-Tusiyyah pg.483-484.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so al-Hurr al-`Amili holds the classic Shia belief that the Qur&#8217;anic text is a legitimate religious proof although it&#8217;s missing verses. Similar to al-Fayd al-Kashani and others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad bin Ya`qub al-Kulayni is disputably the top Twelver Shia Hadith scholar to ever walk the earth. They trust him and honor him to no end, even going as far as bestowing upon him the title of &#8220;Thiqat-ul-Islam&#8221;. Al-Kulayni is the author of their main book of Hadith &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; which is a large 8 volume collection of traditions and beliefs relied upon by the Twelvers throughout their history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, is he a Muslim who believes in the authenticity of our holy book or is he on the other side of the fence?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelvers will jump right up and shout: &#8220;It is the evil Wahhabi scholars who accuse Kulayni of Tahrif!!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is this the truth though? We find out below,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A- The biggest of Shia scholars testify that al-Kulayni clearly believes in Tahrif.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Fayd al-Kashani writes in the sixth introduction of his book &#8220;Tafsir al-Safi&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the belief of our teachers may Allah have mercy on them, then what is apparent from Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni is that he believed in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an and that it suffered from deletions. This is because he narrated texts in this regard inside his book al-Kafi and never criticized them in any way, although he mentioned in the introduction of his book that he trusts whatever he narrates therein. The same can also be said about his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi writes in his large book &#8220;Mir&#8217;at-ul-`Uqul&#8221; 3/31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Our Companions differed regarding this (i.e Tahrif), al-Saduq ibn Babuwayh and a group held the opinion that the Qur’an is unchanged from how it was revealed and that nothing is missing. Whereas, al-Kulayni, Shaykh al-Mufid and a group of scholars, may Allah sanctify their souls, they believed that the complete Qur’an is with the Imams (as) and that what we have in our Book today is only a part of it.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Nuri al-Tabrasi wrote in the third introduction of his popular book &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Mentioning the opinions of our scholars may Allah be pleased with them all, regarding whether the Qur&#8217;an was changed or unchanged. You must know that they have several opinions in this regard, two of which are famous: The first opinion is that distortions and deletions have occurred in it (i.e the Qur&#8217;an), this is the belief of our venerated scholar Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi, the teacher of al-Kulayni. He announced this explicitly at the beginning of his book of Tafsir and filled it with such narrations, while noting that he declared his commitment to only mentioning in it what he receives from his trusted teachers. This was also the belief of his student, Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni may Allah have mercy on him as attributed to him by a group of scholars. This is because al-Kulayni reported a large amount of explicit narrations in this regard (i.e Tahrif) in Kitab-ul-Hujjah especially in the chapter &#8220;Al-Nukat wal-Nutaf min al-Tanzil&#8221; as well as in Kitab-ul-Rawdah, he never objected to them nor did he give them a convenient interpretation. (&#8230;until he said&#8230;) This too, is the explicit belief of the trusted Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Numani, al-Kulayni&#8217;s student and the author of the popular book &#8220;al-Ghaybah&#8221;, he mentioned it in his small book of Tafsir which he restricted only to mentioning the categories of verses, it serves as an explanation for the introduction of `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi&#8217;s Tafsir.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is confirmed in &#8220;Tafsir al-Qummi&#8221;, if you are to refer to the introduction of the researcher, their Shia scholar Al-Sayyid Tayyib al-Musawi al-Jaza&#8217;iri on pg.23-24:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the Shia, they agreed that there are no additions inserted into the Qur&#8217;an, in fact they claimed a consensus on this. As for deletions, a group of Imami scholars believed it they never took place and they strongly rejected this, such as al-Saduq, Sayyid al-Murtada, abu `Ali al-Tabrasi in &#8220;Majma al-Bayan&#8221; and al-Shaykh al-Tusi in &#8220;al-Tibyan&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s clear from the words of other scholars and early traditionalists as well as late ones, that they believed in deletions such as al-Kulayni, al-Barqi, al-`Ayyashi, al-Nu`mani, Furat bin Ibrahim, Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi author of &#8220;al-Ihtijaj&#8221;, al-Majlisi, al-Sayyid al-Jaza&#8217;iri, al-Hurr al-`Amili, al-`Allamah al-Fatuni and al-Sayyid al-Bahrani. In order to prove their belief, they held on to the verses and narrations that cannot be overlooked. What reduces the shock is that the corruption that took place in their opinions is very small, it is restricted to the verses of love (towards the household) without changing any ruling or altering the general meaning that constitutes the soul of the Qur&#8217;an.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their popular scholar al-Sayyid Habibullah al-Musawi al-Khu&#8217;i said in his book &#8220;Minhaj-ul-Bara`ah&#8221; 2/198:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Majority of Akhbaris as reported by al-Sayyid al-Jaza&#8217;iri in his treatise &#8220;Manba`-ul-Hayah&#8221; and his book &#8220;al-Anwar&#8221; believed that corruption, addition and deletion have occurred. This opinion was held by Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi, his student Muhammad bin Ya`qub al-Kulayni, Shaykh Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi and the grand scholar and traditionalist al-Majlisi may Allah sanctify their souls.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Ayatullah al-Sayyid Yusuf al-Tabrizi said in &#8220;Durar al-Fawa&#8217;id&#8221; 1/303:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the corruption, as in deletion, they have differed on it. What is popular among Usulis is that it never happened and this was adopted by a group of scholars such as al-Saduq in &#8220;al-I`tiqadat&#8221; among others. As for those who believed in distortion, they are a group of the ancient traditionalists such as al-Kulayni, his teacher `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi the author of the commentary, al-Nu`mani, Sa`d bin `Abdullah al-Ash`ari as well as most Akhbaris. Some of our researchers have concluded that corruption took place through deletion, however this has not affected the verses which contain rulings as is the belief of al-Muhaqqiq abu al-Qasim bin Hasan al-Qummi in &#8220;al-Qawanin&#8221;.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar al-`Allamah Yusuf al-Bahrani says in &#8220;al-Durar al-Najafiyyah&#8221; 4/66:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[A group believed that it happened (i.e Tahrif), the respected and trusted `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi has affirmed this with certainty in his commentary. It is also what&#8217;s apparent from his student al-Kulayni in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; where he reported a lot of narrations pointing to omissions and deletions without rejecting them nor offering another interpretation. This is also what&#8217;s apparent from the respected and trusted Ahmad bin abi Talib al-Tabrasi in &#8220;al-Ihtijaj&#8221; and it is also quite apparent in my own opinion. Our teacher, the traditionalist Shaykh `Abdullah bin Salih al-Bahrani has affirmed it with certainty as well in his book &#8220;Muniyat-ul-Mumarisin&#8221; and this was the chosen opinion by the teacher of the sect al-Mufid in &#8220;Ajwibat al-Masa&#8217;il al-Sarawiyyah&#8221;etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their scholar Ayatullah Sayyid `Ali Fani Isfahani said in &#8220;Aara&#8217; Hawl al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; pg.88:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The fifth question: Who are those that believe in Tahrif and what are their evidences?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is that a group of traditionalists and collectors of narrations have observed in our reports what appears to imply corruption through deletion so they believed in this. (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) This appears to be the opinion of al-Kulayni who narrated clear reports about it without making any comments. Al-Sayyid Ni`matullah al-Jaza&#8217;iri  also adopted the position of Tahrif in his two commentaries on the &#8220;Tahdhibayn&#8221; and he conducted a prolonged research concerning it in a treatise he called &#8220;Manba` al-Hayah&#8221;.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to other well known Shia scholars who attributed this belief to al-Kulayni but we need not translate more quotes as the above are sufficient for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask, after all this do the Shia laymen still insist that it is the &#8220;Wahhabies&#8221; who attribute Tahrif to your scholar? Or is it his own comrades who confirm his belief in Tahrif?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B- Al-Kulayni reports many narrations in his book clearly implying Tahrif.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man collected in his large book plenty of reports that clearly imply the distortion and corruption of Allah&#8217;s book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is important to note here is that the author of al-Kafi has divided his book into three parts. The first part is called &#8220;Usul al-Kafi&#8221; and it contains the foundations and most important pillars in the belief system of the Twelvers, the second part is called &#8220;Furu` al-Kafi&#8221;  and it contains the branches and general laws of Twelver jurisprudence, the third part is the least important and is called &#8220;Rawdat-ul-Kafi&#8221; and it contains some stories and odd events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni has designated a specific chapter called &#8220;Bab Fihi Nukatun wa Nutafun min al-Tanzil fil-Walayah&#8221; in which he collects a large number of such reports. Of course since Tahrif is from the foundations of his faith he includes this chapter in volume one of Usul al-Kafi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other similar narrations will be scattered all throughout the eight volumes of al-Kafi, so let us list a few examples for you below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/414:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) Abu Basir, from abi `Abdillah (as), regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger in loving `Ali and loving of the leaders after him has certainly attained a great attainment&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;This is how it was revealed.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment} [33:71]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/416:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from `Abdullah bin Sinan, from abi `Abdillah (as) regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And We had already taken a promise from Adam concerning Muhammad, `Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn and the leaders from their progeny, but he forgot&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;By Allah, this is the way it was revealed upon Muhammad (saw).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.} [20:115]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/417:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from Jabir, from abi Ja`far (as), he said: &#8220;Jibril (as) revealed this verse to Muhammad (saw) like this: How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed about `Ali through [their] outrage.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{How wretched is that for which they sold themselves &#8211; that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage} [2:90]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/422:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from abu Basir, from abi `Abdillah (as) regarding Allah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;A questioner asked about a punishment bound to happen &#8211; To the disbelievers in `Ali&#8217;s love; of it there is no preventer.&#8221; He (as) said: &#8220;By Allah, this is how Jibril (as) revealed it to Muhammad (saw).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the verse in our Qur&#8217;an today only says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{A questioner asked about a punishment bound to happen &#8211; To the disbelievers; of it there is no preventer.} [70:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, al-Kulayni has a chapter in his first volume called: &#8220;That nobody collected the entire Qur&#8217;an except the Imams (as)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under it he reports narrations such as, al-Kafi 1/228:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) from Jabir, he said: I heard aba Ja`far (as) saying: &#8220;No one can claim that he has gathered the entire Qur&#8217;an as it was revealed except a liar. It was only collected and memorized, as Allah revealed it, by `Ali (as) and the Imams after him (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to plenty of other examples. However, a Shia will quickly jump and say that these reports can be weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If that&#8217;s the objection then let us quote for this Shia authentic narrations from al-Kafi that clearly imply Tahrif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 2/634:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Al-Hakam from Hisham bin Salim from Abi `Abdullah (as), he said, “The Qur’an that Jibril (as) brought down to Muhammad (saw) has seventeen thousand verses.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It goes without saying that our Qur&#8217;an today is a lot less, it&#8217;s around six thousand verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia will try to object to this report by two methods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- They will try to weaken the narrator and we refuted them (<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/02/19/response-to-hadeeth-17000-verses-in-the-quraan-saheeh/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- They will say it&#8217;s originally seven thousand not seventeen. They say it&#8217;s a copyist error. This too is false since if one were to return to the manuscripts of al-Kafi he&#8217;d realize that the vast majority of them state it is 17,000. It&#8217;s not possible all writers got it wrong while a single one got it right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/184:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from Ibn Abi `Umayr from Umar bin Udhaynah from Burayd bin Muawiyah, he said: Abu Ja`far (as) recited, “O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you fear disagreement in this matter, refer it to Allah and the Messenger and those in authority among you,” He then said, “How can he order to obedience but not in disagreement? He said this to those that were ordered, those that were told to: Obey Allah and obey His Messenger.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qur&#8217;an we have today says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O’ you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree on something, refer it to Allah and the Messenger} [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/290</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from `Ali bin Asbat from `Ali bin abi Hamzah from abu Baseer from abu `Abdillah (as): &#8220;And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited with the authority of the devils during the reign of Solomon.&#8221; And he also recited: &#8220;Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. So from them is he who believed, and from them is he who rejected, and from them is he who affirmed, and from them is he who changed, And whoever exchanges the favor of Allah [for disbelief] after it has come to him – then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verses are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon.} [2:102]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. And whoever exchanges the favor of Allah [for disbelief] after it has come to him – then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.} [2:211]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/184:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from `Ali bin Asbat from `Ali bin abi Hamzah from abu Baseer from abu `Abdillah (as): &#8220;And if We had decreed upon them, “Kill yourselves and submit to the Imam in (full, willing) submission or Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. And if the opponents did what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].&#8221; and in this verse: &#8220;and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged in the matter of the leadership, and submit to Allah their obedience in [full, willing] submission.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verses are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And if We had decreed upon them, “Kill yourselves” or “Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].} [4:66]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.} [4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 8/205:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi `Umayr from Hammad bin `Uthman that he said: I recited to abu `Abdullah (as) {Two just men from among you} He (as) said it is &#8220;A just man among you&#8221; He (as) said: “This is from the mistakes of the writers.”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verse is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram. And whoever of you kills it intentionally – the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed, as judged by two just men among you as an offering [to Allah] delivered to the Ka’bah, or an expiation: the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting, that he may taste the consequence of his deed. Allah has pardoned what is past; but whoever returns [to violation], then Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.} [5:95]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kafi 1/391:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from ibn abi `Umayr from ibn Uthaynah from Zurarah or Burayd from abi Ja`far (as) that he said: “Allah addressed Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in his book.” I said: “Where?” he (as) said: “In his saying {And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful. But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, judge concerning that which they agreed on, that if Allah put Muhammad to death they shall never return this matter to bani Hashim and then find within themselves no discomfort from your judgement on them to either kill or forgive [them] and that they submit in [full, willing] submission.}”]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correct verse is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of Allah. And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Muhammad], and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful.} [4:64]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.} [4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those seeking more authentic narrations, return to our article (<a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/07/24/authentic-shia-narration-declaring-the-corruption-of-the-quran/" rel="external nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C- Al-Kulayni trusted the contents of his book and wished for us to adopt them as part of our faith.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Shia will argue: Well, how do we know al-Kulayni believes in these? What if he&#8217;s just collecting narrations in his book without accepting all the contents?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We reply: You do not seem to understand why al-Kulayni authored his book in the first place. He received complains from the Shia that knowledge was being lost and that the people were in great confusion as to what the correct teachings of Ahlul-Bayt are. Al-Kulayni then decided to aid them by collecting the reports he trusts and compiling his book in a way that every Shia belief has reports that back it up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, al-Kulayni lists the Shia beliefs as chapter titles then lists supporting narrations under each chapter to prove that it is from the true Shia faith. While al-Kulayni may not necessarily believe in the authenticity of every individual narration on its own, for instance he may declare a belief then list five narrations under it. Al-Kulayni doesn&#8217;t need to necessarily believe in the authenticity of all five yet it&#8217;s sufficient for him that one or two are authentic and the rest serve as a back-up to reinforce this belief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our case, it is enough for al-Kulayni to mention loads of narrations clearly implying the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an, by doing so he has established this belief even if he doesn&#8217;t necessarily believe every single report is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below you will see the words of al-Kulayni and the words of other Shia scholars that clearly point to what we wrote above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni confirmed the authenticity of his reports in the introduction of his book 1/8:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving authentic [Sahih] narrations of the truthful ones (as) and the upright and acted upon traditions from it—through which the compulsory duties of Allah, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled. And you said: ‘If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allah will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.’]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above we conclude that the man clearly asked for reliable authentic teachings, so al-Kulayni answered the call saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Allah, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meaning, he confirms that the book he compiled is indeed sufficient for them and is up to the standards in terms of authenticity and reliability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader and expert in the field of narrations, al-Hurr al-`Amili commented on this in &#8220;Khatimat Tafsil al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221; 30/196:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points. One of these points is: His statement: ‘Authentic narrations.’ It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [Sahih] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-authentic narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will be further explained. Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [Sahih] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness [Tawatur].]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also wrote in &#8220;Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah&#8221; 20/96-97:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The authors of the four books and their likes were more than capable of distinguishing what&#8217;s authentic from what isn&#8217;t. How then is it when we&#8217;re talking about the head of the traditionalists (i.e Kulayni) and the leader of the truthful sect?]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader Husayn al-Nuri al-Tabrasi writes in &#8220;Mustadrak al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221; 3/532:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Kafi from among the four (main) books is like the sun between the stars. If the unbiased one were to contemplate, he&#8217;d realize that there&#8217;s no need to check the condition of individual narrators in its chains. He would feel that it&#8217;s trustworthy and he&#8217;d be at ease with regards to its reports, in terms of their issuance and that they&#8217;re established and authentic.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia Ayatullah Muhammad Mahdi al-Asifi says the following about al-Kafi as is quoted in &#8220;Riyad al-Masa&#8217;il&#8221; by Sayyid `Ali Tabataba&#8217;i 1/31:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He—may Allah have mercy on him—has collected what he found authentic from the narrations of the guiding Imams (as) in this encyclopedia of his (i.e al-Kafi).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia Ayatullah abu Talib al-Tabrizi confirms this in &#8220;Mu`jam al-Mahasin&#8221; pg.17:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[He (i.e al-Kulayni) has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction, when he said: ‘Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving authentic [Sahih] narrations of the truthful ones (as)…’ to: ‘Allah, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.’]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Din al-Musawi wrote in letter 110 of &#8220;Al-Muraja`at&#8221; pg.311:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Kafi, al-Tahdhib, al-Istibsar and Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqi are mass transmitted, their contents are certainly authentic and al-Kafi is the oldest, best and most accurate of them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shia leader al-Fayd al-Kashani wrote in the second introduction of &#8220;Al-Wafi&#8221; pg.23:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The authors of both books (al-Kafi &amp; al-Faqih) have taken the path recognized by the early scholars by declaring as authentic [Sahih] what they rely upon and feel comfortable towards. They have declared the authenticity of all the content in their two books from the narrations, even if much of it would not be considered correct according to the standards of the late scholars.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their popular scholar `Abdul-Rasul al-Ghafar wrote in &#8220;Al-Kulayni wal-Kafi&#8221; pg.391-392:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[When al-Kulayni sensed the need and realized the necessity of such a book, he began working on &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221; and was cautious to not include in it except what is authentic from the reports of Ahlul-Bayt (as). This is why he struggled for twenty years, comparing narrations, scrutinizing them, researching their chains, narrators and texts. (&#8230;until he says&#8230;) Knowing that he lived in the period of minor occultation, where he was near the four emissaries and so he would visit them as well as the representatives of the (hidden) Imam (as).]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other Shia scholars admitted that al-Kulayni believed in the authenticity of his book but they said his opinions are not binding as he can make mistakes in judging the authenticity of these reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sayyid Muhammad Mujahid al-Tabataba&#8217;i writes in &#8220;Mafatih al-Usul&#8221; pg.332:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Indeed, the testimony of al-Kulayni concerning the authenticity of (the narrations) he has recorded in al-Kafi, just as it is possible that it is in consideration of his knowledge and certainty of their issuance from the Imams (as), in which case it is permissible to depend upon them and its status will be the same as of all the reports of just individuals, it is (also) possible that it is in consideration of his independent judgment [Ijtihad] and their appearance to him on the basis of conjectural proof. In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [Mujtahid] is not proof for those of the same stature.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In brief he says al-Kulayni&#8217;s Ijtihad is not binding upon other scholars since they can differ in their judgment of what&#8217;s authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayatullah Husayn `Ali al-Muntazari writes in &#8220;Dirasat fil-Makasib al-Muharramah&#8221; 3/123:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The belief of al-Kulayni about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D- Objections or arguments that may arise in opposition to the above.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here we reach the end of our article and we shall mention our opponent&#8217;s weak defense to what we established above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Their first argument will be: Kulayni says to refer back to Allah&#8217;s book and dismiss what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We answer: Why didn&#8217;t he dismiss them then? Instead, we find that he includes them and quotes a lot of them in his book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because the above is listed in the introduction of al-Kafi, the context is that the man was describing to al-Kulayni how it is impossible for him and his people to differentiate between all contradicting narrations coming from  the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why al-Kulayni&#8217;s book does not have much contradictions, since al-Kulayni did not include the reports that oppose what he thinks are the correct teaching of Ahlul-Bayt. Al-Kulayni included only what he wished for the Shia to adhere to including plenty of reports about Tahrif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulayni tells the man in the introduction that the Imams specified three ways to distinguish what&#8217;s correctly attributed to them:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Present the conflicting reports to Allah&#8217;s book and reject what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(This does not conflict with the belief in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, because al-Kulayni and his likes believed the Qur&#8217;an was simply missing some of `Ali&#8217;s merits and the flaws of his opponents. As for the general context and rulings, they are intact and thus one is able to present narrations to it and see which ones hold-up.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Present the conflicting reports to the beliefs of Ahlul-Sunnah and dismiss what agrees with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Ahlul-Sunnah believe the Qur&#8217;an is un-distorted and so the opposite would be to accept the Shia reports declaring the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Follow the consensus of the Shia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Shia have a lot of disagreements and that&#8217;s why Kulayni wrote al-Kafi in the first place. This option is invalid)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Their second argument will be: A narration is reported in al-Kafi 8/53 that implies the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered.</p>
<p>The report in question is regarding a letter by abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[(with his chain) Yazid bin `Abdullah, from whoever told him, he said: Abu Ja`far (as) wrote etc&#8230;]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The long narration continues with the Imam criticizing the commoners until he writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The result of their abandonment of the Book, is that they upheld its letters but distorted its limits. They read it but do not care for it, so the ignorant among them is pleased with their memorization whereas the scholars are aggrieved at their lack of care]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We answer: This does not mean that the Qur&#8217;an is unchanged. When the Imam says &#8220;They upheld its letters but distorted its limits&#8221; he means that they took great care of reciting it in the best manner and cared more for the pronunciation of its letters than they did for respecting its laws, limits and rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their renowned scholar Al-Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani writes in &#8220;Al-Durar al-Najafiyyah&#8221; 4/69:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the narration in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221;, what&#8217;s apparent is that it means that the commoners upheld the letters &#8211; meaning, by reciting with good voices and adhering to the etiquette of recitation as well as all favorable means they established among themselves, in addition to finishing its entire recitation on a regular basis. However, they corrupted its limits by giving it their own personal interpretations without returning back to the people of revelation (i.e Imams) to learn its laws and prohibitions. This is what&#8217;s apparent from the narration, thus it contains no evidence for what they claim.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, al-Bahrani is disproving those who argued with the report to prove the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered and un-corrupted, he answered as you saw above by saying this is clearly not the case and the report does not constitute legitimate evidence for their stance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope that this is sufficient evidence for all those with intellect that al-Kulayni is one of the staunchest believers in Tahrif, that this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; accusation as they claim and we hope that the article is a solid testament to the corruption of Twelver Shia faith.</p>
