<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is commonly accepted among the Shias today that Sunnis are praying the Maghrib prayers before the time that has been stipulated by the Shari’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Sunnis, as long as the actual sun&#8217;s disc disappears, the time is  Maghrib. As for Shias, they maintain that the time of Maghrib is when the redness of the East is no longer visible, which occurs around ten to fifteen minutes after the actual sun disappears (and perhaps even longer depending on the region). This is especially significant in Ramadan, since Shias argue that Sunnis are breaking their fast before Maghrib time, and thus, their fasting is not accepted. To support this belief, Shias often bring forth multiple narrations to support this position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Imams, in many occasions, also stated that Maghrib occurs when the sun&#8217;s disc disappears.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Narrations</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wasa’el Al-Shia 4/177-183 provides a large list of the narrations that support the view that Maghrib starts when the sun&#8217;s disc disappears:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Al-Jarud said: Abu Abdullah (as) said, “I now pray it (Maghrib) when sun’s disc has fallen.”</li>
<li>Al-Kafi/Al-Tahtheeb: Abdullah bin Sinan said: I heard Abu Abdullah (as) say, “The time of Maghrib is when the sun sets and the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Kafi/Al-Tahtheeb: Zurarah said: I heard Abu Ja’afar (as) say, “Maghrib is when the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Abu Ja’afar (as) said, “Maghrib is when the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Al-Sadiq (as) said, “If the sun disappears, then it is time to break the fast and prayer becomes obligatory.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Jabir (Al-Ju’fi) narrated from Abu Ja’afar (as) that he said, “The Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) said: If the disc disappears, he who fasts eats, and the time of prayer has begun.”</li>
<li>Amali Al-Saduq: Dawud bin Abi Yazeed said: Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) said, “If the sun disappears, the time of Maghrib has occurred.”</li>
<li>Amali Al-Saduq: Al-Rabee’ bin Sulaiman, Aban bin Arqam, and others narrated that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) prayed while sunlight was noticeable. When asked, he said, “If the sun sets, the time of prayer has occurred.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb/Amali Al-Saduq/Ilal Al-Shara’i’: Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) was asked about the time of Maghrib. He said, “When the <em>kursi </em>disappears.” He was asked, “What is its <em>kursi</em>?” He replied, “Its disc.” He asked, “When does the disc disappear?” He said, “If you look at it and cannot see it.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Isma’eel bin Al-Fadhl Al-Hashimi narrated from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as), who said, “The Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) prayed Maghrib when the sun sets, when the edge disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Abu Baseer said that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) said, “The time of Maghrib is when the sun disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Amr bin Abi Nasr said that he heard Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) say about Maghrib, “When the disc disappears, it is time for prayer, and (time to) eat.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shia Explanation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arguing against the authenticity of these reports does not occur since the above reports are plenty in number. Furthermore, some of them are indeed authentic according to Shia hadith standards, like the hadiths of Abdullah bin Sinan, Zurarah, and Dawud bin Abi Yazeed. Due to this, Shias focus on reconciling these reports with others that speak of Maghrib occurring when the redness of the East disappears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: It is important to be aware that there are more authentic reports the support the view that Maghrib starts when the disc disappears than the reports that supports the view that it starts after the redness of the East disappears.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Excuse #1: Reconciliation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The argument is that these reports speak of one of the two conditions of Maghrib, which is the disappearance of the disc of the sun. The other condition is the disappearance of the redness of the East. In other words, the claim is that the followers of the Imam need to place these narrations together and to hold the view that Maghrib occurs after both these conditions are met.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This argument is very flawed, since it means that the reports provided above are incomplete in nature, and result to a false understanding of the time of Maghrib. Take the following scenario as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we had two reports, one saying that the Imam stated that the time of Maghrib is <strong>after 6pm</strong> and the other saying that it is <strong>at 6:15pm</strong>, then according to this rationale, breaking the fast at 6:15pm is the correct view since 6:15pm occurs after 6pm. Obviously, our response is that everyone that follows the first hadith and breaks the fast from 6:01-6:14pm has invalidated their fast due to the incomplete information provided by the Imam.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Excuse #2: Taqiyyah</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The go-to excuse that is provided by every Shia scholar in cases of contradictions is the handy <em>taqiyyah </em>card. The argument is: Since Sunnis break the fast upon the disappearance of the disc, it is only natural to assume that the Imams they practiced <em>taqiyyah</em> to appeal to Sunnis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dangers of this belief are devastating. It suggests that the Imams, that were sent as guides for humanity, falsely taught people to break their fast at an invalid time. This disastrous belief goes against the very reason for the existence of the Imam: Guidance.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The explanations that are provided to solve the issue of the contradicting reports fall short. It becomes obvious that the Imams either truly contradicted themselves or that these are false attributions to them by their companions or by Shia narrators in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Objective Shias are perhaps left without a resolution to this contradiction, since there are no external evidences to support either position. However, this dilemma isn’t restricted to this <em>fiqhi</em> topic alone, but can be found in all sections of Shia Shari’ah, which is one of the major issues with Shia hadith and the failure of their hadith grading system.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Lanat?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The linguistic meaning of <em>lanat</em> is to cuss out, however, in Islamic terminology; <em>lanat</em> is mainly used to describe an invocation that Allah banishes one from His mercy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Ethics of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The act of <em>lanat</em> is disliked in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find in Saheeh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad by Al-Bukhari #309 that Salim said, “I never heard Abdullah (bin Omar) make <em>lanat</em> upon a human ever,” Ibn Omar said: The Prophet – peace be upon him – said, “A believer should not be a <em>la’aan</em> (one who makes <em>lanat</em>).”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet – peace be upon him – also said #316, “<em>La’aaneen</em> (those that make <em>lanat</em>) will not be witnesses or intermediaries on the day of Judgment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; says #317, “A <em>siddeeq</em> should not be a <em>la’aan</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>He – peace be upon him – also said #321 when asked to invoke the curse of Allah upon the disbelievers, “I was not sent as a <em>la’aan</em>, but I was sent as a mercy!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In hadith #430, Anas says, “The Prophet – peace be upon him – was not vile, nor a <em>la’aan</em>, nor a curses, and all he would say in condemnation was, ‘Why have you brought dirt onto your head?’”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sunni View of Lanat</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an agreement among Sunni scholars that one may invoke the <em>lanat</em> of Allah upon disbelievers and evil-doers. However, the majority state that it is not permissible to make <em>lanat</em> on specific individuals since there is always a chance that they could repent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agreed upon exception to this is a specific individual that is damned to hell in the Qur’an or Sunnah (i.e. Iblees, Abu Jahal, Abu Lahab, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a difference of opinion in regards to other specific individuals, like Yazeed bin Mu’awiyah for example, since some Sunni scholars believe that it is permissible to curse him specifically.</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad, when asked about this, as we find in Muntakhab Ilal Al-Khalaal p. 239, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer not to say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked about cursing Al-Hajjaj in specific, and he said, &#8220;I prefer not to, and it is best to keep it general, by saying: O&#8217; Allah curse the transgressors.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see, Imam Ahmad was influenced by the ethics displayed by the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; and was not someone that made <em>lanat</em> a common practice. Today, we find the majority of Ahl Al-Sunnah upon the same path. Cautious in their supplications against the transgressors.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shia View of Lanat</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike the Sunni view, <em>lanat</em> has become much more integrated into culture. For example, it is common for Arab Shias to say with a drink of water, “<em>Ishrab wa zeed, wal’an Yazeed,”</em> which translates to, “Keep drinking and cursing Yazeed.” Iranians too have a saying that is equivalent in the Persian tongue.</p>
<p>We also find Shias attributing false reports to Fatima that she used to curse Abu Bakr after every prayer due to their disagreement over <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/05/08/fadak-prophetic-inheritance-qa/">Fadak</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a moderate Shia <em><a href="http://www.aqaed.com/faq/2277/" rel="external nofollow">fatwa site Aqaed.com</a></em>, this action leads to gaining a hundred thousand good deeds (<em>hasanaat</em>), the expiation of a hundred thousand sins, the elevation of a hundred thousand levels in heaven, and is as if one freed a hundred thousand slaves.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also find major scholars like Ayatollah Mohammad Jameel Al-Amili supporting this culture of <em>lanat</em>. He said in his <em><a href="http://www.aletra.org/subject.php?id=749" rel="external nofollow">fatwa</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lanat-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4177" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lanat-1-150x150.jpg" alt="lanat" width="150" height="150" /></a>&#8220;It is liked for one to curse the two idols of Quraish (Abu Bakr and Omar may Allah curse them) at every hour and minute, during <em>qunoot</em> prayers, after bowing, after prostration, after finishing the prayer, and before any action, for it is something that brings one closer to Allah. Evidence of this can be found in the actions of the Head of the Women of Paradise that she used to curse Abu Bakr and Omar at every prayer. The same was done by the Commander of the Faithful Ali peace be onto him, who was known for his supplications against the two idols of Quraish, and used to perform this in his prayers. May Allah aid you in this <em>lanat</em>, which is a part of the <em>bara’a</em> from these two idols, those that love them from the <em>Nawasib</em> today, as well as Bakris and Omaris. This ruling is agreed upon as permissible, and is liked by the majority of the Imami jurists, and whoever has an issue with this is a Bakri Omar, may Allah, His angels, messengers, <em>awliyaa’</em>, and good servants curse them until the day of Judgment.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another interesting quote is provided by Al-Tusirkani, who states in his La&#8217;ali&#8217; Al-Akhbar 4/92 that the best place to curse is after urination while in the toilet. One should say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;O&#8217; Allah make <em>lanat</em> upon Omar, then Abu Bakr and Omar, then Uthman and Omar, then Mu&#8217;awiyah and Omar, then Yazeed and Omar, then Ibn Ziyad and Omar, then Ibn Sa&#8217;ad and Omar, then Shimr and Omar, then their armies and Omar. O&#8217; Allah make <em>lanat</em> upon Aisha, Hafsa, Hind, Umm al-Hakam, and upon the ones who are pleased with their actions until the day of Judgment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to keep in mind that this culture did not come out of thin air, but is the product of Shia narrations that have influenced the minds of the scholars and the masses through the centuries. One such narration is the hadith of Al-Baqir in Mukhtasar Al-Basa’ir p. 73:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Behind this sun are forty suns, and between each sun is a distance of forty years, within them are creations that are not aware whether Allah created Adam or not. Behind this moon are forty moons, and between each is a distance of forty years, and within them are creations that are not aware whether Allah created Adam or not. They were inspired to make <em>lanat</em> in the same way the bees make <em>lanat</em> of the first and the second (Abu Bakr and Omar) at all times. Overseeing them are angels that would punish them if they did not make <em>lanat</em> of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The editor graded the narration as authentic.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahl Al-Sunnah and Shias are very different in the way that they view <em>lanat</em>. Sunnis have it as an exception for specific cases, while Shiasm has it as a cultural practice. Of course, our best advice is to hold onto the Prophet – peace be upon him – and take after his example.</p>

<h2>Shia Kalima as a Declaration of Faith</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we will be discussing the Shia Kalima. As all Muslims know, the known and popular Kalima among Muslims is &#8220;I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, And Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&#8221; (Narrated by Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2484 and <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/01/11/abu-huraira/">Abu Huraira</a> in Saheeh Muslim #27) The Shia Kalima includes the following words &#8220;`Ali yun Waliyullah&#8221; or &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the friend of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The difference between the Sunni Kalima and the Shia Kalima is that the former can be found in the Qur&#8217;an, we find {There is no god except Allah} in Qur&#8217;an [Surat Muhammad, verse 19] and we find {Muhammad is the Messenger of God} in Qur&#8217;an [Surat-ul-Fath, verse 29].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the words &#8220;`Ali is God&#8217;s friend&#8221; are nowhere in the Qur&#8217;an. That&#8217;s their first flaw with the Shia Kalima. To fix this problem, Shia will take a general verse talking about the obedient believers who establish prayer and give charity [Qur&#8217;an 5:55] then claim that the word &#8220;believers&#8221; is &#8220;`Ali&#8221;. This is a weak opinion that relies on fabricated narrations none of which are authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only is the Shia Kalima not in the Qur&#8217;an, but the narrations they use to twist the interpretation of the above verse are all weak and unreliable. This is their second failure and defeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Shia Kalima in the Call to Prayer</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we are done discussing the testimony of faith, and after we showed that the Sunni testimony of faith (Kalima) or as it is referred to &#8220;al-Shahadatayn&#8221; is a part of the Qur&#8217;an whereas the third testimony added by the Shia Kalima is nowhere in God&#8217;s book, we turn our attention to the Islamic call of prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia insist on adding the Shia Kalima to the call to prayer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UztMkUqjskc" rel="external nofollow">Adhan</a>) and at the beginning of every prayer (Iqamah). The Shia attack all those who disagree with them and stubbornly alter the common and mass transmitted texts of the Adhan and Iqamah by inserting &#8220;`Ali-yun Waliyullah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is something the Shia of our days may not know, is that their ancestors, as well as the eleven Imams (excluding the fictional one), have never added the words &#8220;`Ali-yun Waliyullah&#8221; to the Adhan or Iqamah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, let&#8217;s see what the Imams of the Shia said in their authentic narrations as is found in the main books:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> عَنْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ الْجُعْفِيِّ قَالَ سَمِعْتُ أَبَا جَعْفَرٍ ع يَقُولُ الْأَذَانُ وَ الْإِقَامَةُ خَمْسَةٌ وَ ثَلَاثُونَ حَرْفاً فَعَدَّ ذَلِكَ بِيَدِهِ وَاحِداً وَاحِداً الْأَذَانَ ثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ حَرْفاً وَ الْإِقَامَةَ سَبْعَةَ عَشَرَ حَرْفاً</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Ali bin Ibrahim with his chain to aba Ja`far (as) reports: &#8220;The Adhan and the Iqamah have 35 parts, he counted by his hand one by one, the Adhan had 18 parts and the Iqamah 17 parts.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: al-Kafi 3/302. Majlisi said &#8220;Reliable&#8221; in al-Mir&#8217;at 15/82.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their leader al-Mufid confirmed this in al-Muqni`ah 1/100 as he also counted 35 parts as opposed to today&#8217;s Shia who added to make it 39.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To simplify, if you were to add the third Shia testimony regarding `Ali to the Adhan, it becomes 20 parts instead of 18. This shows al-Baqir never approved of this addition or spoke of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&#8217;t stop here, we will notice that according to the Shia standards of Hadith, not ONE authentic Hadith in their books contains the addition of &#8220;`Ali-yun Waliyullah&#8221; as part of the Adhan. Not one authentic narration says that adding these words to Adhan/Iqamah is obligatory or recommended. This, of course, makes it a &#8220;Bid`ah&#8221; or innovation, as is confirmed by their top scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their leader al-Tusi says</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و أمّا ما روي في شواذّ الأخبار من قول: أشهد انّ عليا وليّ اللّه و آل محمّد خير البريّة فممّا لا يعمل عليه في الأذان و الإقامة. فمن عمل بها كان مخطئا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for the odd reports saying &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the friend of God&#8221; and &#8220;I bear witness that the family of Muhammad are the best of creation.&#8221; These are not to be included in neither the Adhan nor the Iqamah. Whoever includes them is comitting an error.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: al-Nihayah pg.69</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their leader al-Shahid al-Thani says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">و أمّا إضافة «أنّ عليّاً وليّ اللّه»، و «آل محمّد خير البريّة» و نحو ذلك فبدعة، و أخبارها موضوعة</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[As for adding &#8220;`Ali-yun Waliullah&#8221; or &#8220;Aal-Muhammad Khayr-ul-Bariyyah&#8221; and similar things (to the Adhan), then this is an innovation and it&#8217;s based on fabricated reports.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Sharh Irshad-ul-Adhhan 2/646</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that they are committing a baseless innovation as stated above is their third failure and defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final nail in the coffin is this quote from one of their biggest and earliest scholars cursing those who make this addition and identifying them as deviant extremists!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their leader al-Saduq says after mentioning the Adhan:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG-20170828-WA0008.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-4154 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG-20170828-WA0008-150x150.jpg" alt="shia kalima" width="150" height="150" /></a>[This is the correct text for the call to prayer, you must not add to it or subtract from it. However, the Mufawwidah (extremist sect of Shia) may God curse them, they fabricated narrations and added to the Adhan these words &#8220;Muhammad &amp; his family are the best of creation&#8221; they announce it twice and in some narrations after bearing witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, they add &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the friend (Wali) of Allah&#8221; also repeating it twice. Others narrated it twice as such &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the chief of believers truly&#8221;. No doubt that `Ali is a friend of God and truly is the chief of believers and that Muhammad&#8217;s family is the best of creation. However, these are not to be included in the Adhan and I mention it only so that those accused of extremism and have insulated themselves in our ranks be known.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Source: Al-Faqih 1/290</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This phenomenon is very common in the Shia world, this is how their sect evolved and kept evolving to this day. What was considered at one point &#8220;Extremism&#8221; for them simply turns into a habit with the passing of time. This is how the early political Shia morphed into a religious sect of extremists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contemporary leader `Abdullah al-Mamaqani says while defending one of their narrators who was accused of &#8220;extremism&#8221; by the ancient Shia:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">إنا قد بينا غير مرة أن رمي القدماء الرجلَ بالغلو لا يُعتمد عليه ولا يُركن إليه، لوضوح كون القول بأدنى مراتب فضائلهم &#8211; يعني الأئمة &#8211; غلواً عند القدماء، وكون ما نعده اليوم من ضروريات مذهب التشيع غلواً عند هؤلاء، وكفاك في ذلك عد الصدوق نفي السهو عنهم غلواً مع أنه اليوم من ضروريات المذهب، وكذلك إثبات قدرتهم على العلم بما يأتي &#8211; أي علم الغيب &#8211; بتوسط جبرائيل والنبي غلواً عندهم وهو من ضروريات المذهب اليوم</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We have clarified more than once, that we do not rely on the ancients when they accuse a man of extremism. Because believing in their smallest virtues (i.e Imam&#8217;s virtues) was considered extremism for our early predecessors. Whatever we consider today as being from the <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/03/19/imam-mahdi/">necessities of our sect</a>, they (i.e the ancient Shia) used to consider as extremism. A sufficient example would be al-Saduq, he considered those who deny the forgetfulness of the Imams as extremists even though it became from the necessities today. Similarly, establishing for them the ability to know the unseen via Jibril or the Prophet was counted as an extremist belief in their eyes although it is from the necessities of our school today.]</p>
<p>Source: Tanqih-ul-Maqal 3/240</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their last failure shows how the inventions of the extremists and deviants make their way into their core beliefs and shape their sect with time until they end up becoming the norm. This is due to their misguidance and ignorance as well as the leadership of their unqualified scholars under the banner of a non-existing Imam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br />
PART-I: WHY ATTACK `UMAR FOR ESTABLISHING TARAWEEH?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon our dear readers, this article shall briefly discuss the practice known today as &#8220;Taraweeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taraweeh as you all know are voluntary night prayers performed in Ramadan after the obligatory `Isha&#8217; and before the Fajr of the next day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This prayer was not called &#8220;Tarweeh&#8221; at the time, it was later labeled by this name by Muslims and it became popular for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second Caliph of Islam, al-Farooq `Umar bin al-Khattab is accused by a group of deviants (the Shia) of having invented this horrible practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Umar may Allah be pleased with him is viewed by Shiites as an evil man whose main purpose is to break the pillars of Islam, weaken the faith and erase the true teachings of religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, `Umar is also viewed as a noble and pious believer with great achievements by the vast majority of Muslims throughout the ages, so how does that make sense? Well, Shiites explain that `Umar only presented outward Islam but internally was a selfish-hypocrite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first issue we tackle in this article is this accusation of hypocrisy. We Ahlul-Sunnah argue: what sense does it make for this evil and selfish person, to go out of his way and encourage people to pray extra during the month of Ramadan?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From what I understood, based on the Qur&#8217;an and the prophetic-teachings, a hypocrite is primarily a person who dislikes worshiping God and avoids it at all costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily} [4:142]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If `Umar detested prayer and wished to enjoy his time, why force himself to stand up for long hours at night for Taraweeh? Why invent Taraweeh and inconvenience himself with such annoyance?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right} [9:67]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And here we ask, is encouraging people to pray during the nights of Ramadan right or wrong? Was `Umar enjoining what&#8217;s wrong by advising them to pray more?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال النبي: أثقل الصلاة على المنافقين صلاة العشاء وصلاة الفجر ولو يعلمون ما فيهما لأتوهما ولو حبوا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Aba Hurayrah reported: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The most difficult prayers for hypocrites are the `Isha&#8217; and Fajr prayers. If only they knew the virtues of these two they would have crawled to attend them.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the above prophetic-narration, we see that two prayers are much more annoying for hypocrites than others, `Isha&#8217; and Fajr. Why is this? Because one of them is at night after a long tiring day of work while the other is early at dawn when people are sleepy, this is why hypocrites often skip them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, we notice that the prayer that `Umar upheld was AFTER `Isha&#8217;. Wouldn&#8217;t a hypocrite like to skip these long night prayers and rest at home? In fact, `Umar was assassinated while leading people during Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above, we conclude that the Shia are not reasonable in their claim that `Umar bin al-Khattab was an evil-hypocrite who wished to corrupt the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PART-II: THE ORIGIN OF THE &#8220;TARAWEEH&#8221; PRAYER</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NEXT, we discuss the condition of the people before `Umar&#8217;s reign. What did the Prophet (saw) say about these extra night prayers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يُرَغِّبُ فِي قِيَامِ رَمَضَانَ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَأْمُرَهُمْ بِعَزِيمَةٍ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ‏ مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Aba Hurayrah narrates: The Messenger of God (saw) used to commend prayer at night during Ramadan but did not command it as a duty. He (saw) used to say: &#8220;Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer, out of piety and to seek God&#8217;s reward, his previous sins will be forgiven for him.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : إن الله عز وجل فرض صيام رمضان ، وسننت قيامه ، فمن صامه وقامه إيمانا واحتسابا ، خرج من ذنوبه كيوم ولدته أمه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Abdul-Rahman bin `Awf narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;God most glorious Has made Ramadan&#8217;s fast obligatory while I have made it my tradition to stay up in prayer during the nights. Whosoever shall fast and pray the nights in piety while seeking its rewards will be released from his sins as his mother released him at birth.&#8221; (Musnad Ahmad)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) encouraged them to spend the nights of Ramadan in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The Prophet (saw) never declared that Taraweeh was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- He (saw) described its great reward for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alright, so we understand from the above that the people were praying during the nights in the mosques and the houses to seek this great bounty. The question now is, were they praying these prayers together in congregation or was it individual worship?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ عَائِشَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهَا قَالَتْ: كَانَ النَّاسُ يُصَلُّونَ فِي مَسْجِدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فِي رَمَضَانَ بِاللَّيْلِ أَوْزَاعًا يَكُونُ مَعَ الرَّجُلِ الشَيْءُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ فَيَكُونُ مَعَهُ النَّفْرُ الْخَمْسَةُ أَوِ السِّتَّةُ وَأَقَلُّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَأَكْثَرُ , يُصَلُّونَ بِصَلَاتِهِ , قَالَتْ: فَأَمَرَنِي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَيْلَةً مِنْ ذَاكَ أَنْ أَنْصِبَ لَهُ حَصِيرًا عَلَى بَابِ حُجْرَتِي , فَفَعَلْتُ , فَخَرَجَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ بَعْدَ أَنْ صَلَّى الْعِشَاءَ الْآخِرَةَ فَاجْتَمَعَ إِلَيْهِ مَنْ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ فَصَلَّى بِهِمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَيْلًا طَوِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`A&#8217;ishah said: During Ramadan, the people used to pray at night inside the mosque of the Prophet (saw) and they&#8217;d be in random groups. If a man has memorized some Qur&#8217;an, he&#8217;d lead a party of five or six in these prayers. In one of these nights the Prophet (saw) ordered me to prepare for him a prayer mat outside my room and after he prayed the last `Isha&#8217; he left. Upon his arrival at the mosque, people gathered around him so he led them in long prayers during the night. (Nayl-ul-Awtar)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ ، قَالَ : صُمْنَا مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَمَضَانَ ، فَلَمْ يَقُمْ بِنَا شَيْئًا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ حَتَّى بَقِيَ سَبْعٌ ، فَقَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى ذَهَبَ ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ السَّادِسَةُ لَمْ يَقُمْ بِنَا ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الْخَامِسَةُ قَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى ذَهَبَ شَطْرُ اللَّيْلِ ، فَقُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ، لَوْ نَفَّلْتَنَا قِيَامَ هَذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ ، قَالَ : فَقَالَ : إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ إِذَا صَلَّى مَعَ الْإِمَامِ حَتَّى يَنْصَرِفَ حُسِبَ لَهُ قِيَامُ لَيْلَةٍ ، قَالَ : فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الرَّابِعَةُ لَمْ يَقُمْ ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الثَّالِثَةُ جَمَعَ أَهْلَهُ وَنِسَاءَهُ وَالنَّاسَ ، فَقَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى خَشِينَا أَنْ يَفُوتَنَا الْفَلَاحُ ، قَالَ : قُلْتُ : وَمَا الْفَلَاحُ ؟ قَالَ : السُّحُورُ ، ثُمَّ لَمْ يَقُمْ بِقِيَّةَ الشَّهْرِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu Dharr reported: We fasted Ramadan with the Messenger of Allah (saw) and he did not lead us in the night prayers (i.e Qiyam) until there were seven days left of the month, then he led us in night prayers until one-third of the night had passed. Then, when there were six days left, he did not lead us. When there were five days left, he led us in praying the night until half that night had passed. At that point, I requested: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (saw), why don&#8217;t you lead us for the rest of this night?&#8221; He (saw) answered me: &#8220;Worry not, If a man prays with the leader until he leaves, it will be counted as if he spent the whole night in prayer.&#8221; Then, when there were four days left, he did not lead us in the night prayers. When there were three days left he sent for his daughters and women, and gathered the people, and he led us in praying all throughout the night until we feared that we would miss &#8220;al-Falah&#8221;. He did not lead for the remainder of that month.&#8221; Dawud (one of the narrators) asked: &#8220;What is al-Falah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;The time of Suhur.&#8221; (Sunan al-Tirmidhi)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) did lead them in the long night prayers during Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- He (saw) led them multiple times during the last third of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So an Imam leading the people during the Qiyam of the evening does not seem to be an innovation or a new invention but the question now is why this peculiar pattern? Why did the Prophet (saw) do it on some days and drop it at other times randomly?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عائشة &#8211; رضي الله عنها &#8211; : أن رسول الله &#8211; صلى الله عليه وسلم &#8211; صلى في المسجد ذات ليلة فصلى بصلاته ناس ، ثم صلى من القابلة فكثر الناس ، ثم اجتمعوا من الليلة الثالثة أو الرابعة ، فلم يخرج إليهم رسول الله &#8211; صلى الله عليه وسلم &#8211; فلما أصبح قال : &#8221; قد رأيت الذي صنعتم ، فلم يمنعني من الخروج إليكم إلا أني خشيت أن تفرض عليكم . قال : وذلك في رمضان</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`A&#8217;ishah narrated: The Messenger (saw) prayed at the mosque one night and some people prayed behind him. Then he (saw) did similarly the next day and the number of people increased. On the third or fourth, people gathered but the Prophet (saw) never came out till morning, then he (saw) stood and addressed them saying: &#8220;I see what you&#8217;re doing and the only thing that prevented me from coming out to you was that I feared it may become a prescribed obligatory duty.&#8221; And that was in Ramadan. (Sunan al-Nasa&#8217;i al-Kubra)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) loved to pray Taraweeh in congregation alongside his Companions but he feared it would turn into an obligatory prayer so he avoided it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what was the condition of the people when it comes to these night prayers during those times? To learn this, we quote the early renowned scholar Shihab-ul-Din al-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال ابن شهاب فتوفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم والأمر على ذلك ثم كان الأمر على ذلك في خلافة أبي بكر وصدرا من خلافة عمر بن الخطاب</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Zuhri said: So the Prophet (saw) passed away and the condition was as such during the Caliphate of Abi Bakr and the first part of `Umar bin al-Khattab&#8217;s Caliphate. (Muwatta&#8217; Malik)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, people remained in that situation -some praying individually, others praying in congregation- inside the mosque until `Umar organized them in the Masjid. With this, we move to the main narration that gets the deviants riled up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عبد الرحمن بن عبد القاري أنه قال خرجت مع عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه ليلة في رمضان إلى المسجد فإذا الناس أوزاع متفرقون يصلي الرجل لنفسه ويصلي الرجل فيصلي بصلاته الرهط فقال عمر إني أرى لو جمعت هؤلاء على قارئ واحد لكان أمثل ثم عزم فجمعهم على أبي بن كعب ثم خرجت معه ليلة أخرى والناس يصلون بصلاة قارئهم قال عمر نعم البدعة هذه والتي ينامون عنها أفضل من التي يقومون يريد آخر الليل وكان الناس يقومون أوله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn `Abdul-Qari said: I went out to the mosque with `Umar bin al-Khattab on a night from the nights of Ramadan. As we entered, we saw that the people were divided, some praying individually and others forming groups and leading people. Upon this, `Umar said: &#8220;If I united these folks behind a single reciter that would be best.&#8221; After deciding on this, he gathered them behind Ubay bin Ka`b. The next night, I went out with him while the people stood behind their reciter (i.e Ubay) so `Umar said: &#8220;A blessed innovation this is. However, those who sleep during it have done even better than those who stay up.&#8221; He means those who stay up to pray at the end of the night as opposed to those who stay up to pray at the beginning of the night. (Sahih Bukhari)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- People were still praying the nights of Ramadan as individuals and groups as the Messenger (saw) left them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Caliph `Umar decided to organize the Muslims behind one Imam in Taraweeh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- Ubay bin Ka`b was the best Qur&#8217;anic reciter at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">D- `Umar was satisfied with this decision and thinks it&#8217;s better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">E- Praying the last part of the night is better than praying the first part of the night according to `Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">F- People were free to join the congregation or pray the night prayers separately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The issue arises when people read the expression &#8220;A blessed innovation this is.&#8221; They think that `Umar has committed a sin by innovating. Truth of the matter, is that as you clearly saw from previous reports, `Umar never innovated a new thing in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because the word &#8220;Bid`ah&#8221; can be used in its linguistic form or its technical scholarly form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example is the word Sahabi (companion), in its linguistic form it simply means a person who accompanies you on a journey or a person who spends a lot of time with you. Whereas in its scholarly technical form it means: &#8220;Any person who saw the Prophet (saw), embraced Islam and died upon it.&#8221; A big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example is the word Hadith (narration), in its linguistic form it simply means any story you narrate about anything. Whereas in its scholarly technical form it means: &#8220;Any words, actions or confirmations by the Prophet (saw).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, the word Bid`ah (innovation), in its linguistic form means any change whether good or bad, such as the Qur&#8217;an being printed on paper instead of animal skin like in the past. This simply makes accessing it and preserving it more convenient, it does not change the Qur&#8217;an&#8217;s nature, text or status. Whereas the technical term is referred to as &#8220;Ihdaath&#8221; or &#8220;Adding new religious tenets without precedent or subtracting from the religious tenets without excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When `Umar used it he simply meant &#8220;This is a blessed change&#8221; or &#8220;A change for the best&#8221; not that he added something to the religion or changed the tradition of night prayers that was previously established by Rasul-Allah (saw). Furthermore, `Umar is often praised for reviving this blessed tradition since after the seal of prophet-hood there was no chance of it becoming obligatory duty because revelation ended (which was the only reason the Messenger (saw) never did it regularly).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also seems from the narration, that `Umar believes it&#8217;s more rewarding to sleep after `Isha&#8217; and wake up to pray these same night prayers before Fajr. However, most people played it safe since there were no alarm clocks to wake you before Fajr Adhan so Taraweeh was most popular at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PART-III: WHAT DID `ALI BIN ABI TALIB THINK OF TARAWEEH?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LASTLY, what do we read concerning the opinion of `Ali bin abi Talib regarding the Taraweeh prayer?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْحَارِثِ الْخَرَّازُ ، قَالَ : ثنا سِنَانُ بْنُ حَاتِمٍ ، قثنا جَعْفَرُ بْنُ سُلَيْمَانَ ، قثنا حُبَابٌ الْقُطَعِيُّ ، عَنْ أَبِي إِسْحَاقَ الْهَمْدَانِيِّ ، قَالَ : خَرَجَ عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ فِي أَوَّلِ لَيْلَةٍ مِنْ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ وَالْقَنَادِيلُ تُزْهِرُ ، وَكِتَابُ اللَّهِ يُتْلَى فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ ، فَقَالَ : نَوَّرَ اللَّهُ لَكَ يَا عُمَرُ ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ فِي قَبْرِكَ ، كَمَا نَوَّرْتَ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ بِالْقُرْآنِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin al-Harith al-Kharraz told me: Sinan bin Hatim told us: Ja`far bin Sulayman told us: Hubab al-Quta`i told us: from abi Ishaq al-Hamdani, he said: `Ali bin abi Talib went out on the first night of Ramadan while lanterns were glowing and God&#8217;s Book was recited in the mosques (during Taraweeh). `Ali then supplicated: &#8220;May Allah fill your grave with light O `Umar bin al-Khattab as you&#8217;ve lit God&#8217;s houses with the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; (Fada&#8217;il-Ramadan li Ibn abi al-Duniya)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ مَخْلَدٍ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو الْعَبَّاسِ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنِ يُونُسَ السَّرَّاجُ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ يَعْنِي ابْنَ رَبِيعَةَ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا خَالِدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ الْوَاسِطِيُّ , عَنْ حُصَيْنِ بْنِ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ , عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ السُّلَمِيِّ قَالَ : أَمَّنَا عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ فِي قِيَامِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ قَالَ : وَمَرَّ بِبَعْضِ مَسَاجِدِ أَهْلِ الْكُوفَةِ , وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ الْقِيَامَ فَقَالَ : نَوَّرَ اللَّهُ قَبْرَكَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ كَمَا نَوَّرْتَ مَسَاجِدَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We were told by Ibn Makhlad: abu al-`Abbas Muhammad bin `Abdul-Rahman bin Yunus al-Sarraj told us: `Abdullah bin Muhammad ibn Rabi`ah told us: Khalid bin `Abdullah al-Wasiti told us: from Hosayn bin `Abdul-Rahman, from abi `Abdul-Rahman al-Sulami who said: We were led in prayer in one of the mosques of Kufah by `Ali bin abi Talib during the night prayers of Ramadan. As `Ali passed by some of the mosques of the people of Kufah as they performed their night prayers he said: &#8220;May Allah fill your grave with light O `Umar bin al-Khattab as you&#8217;ve lit our mosques.&#8221; (Shari`ah lil-Ajurri)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ أَبِي الْحَارِثِ , بِبَابِ الشَّامِ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا عُبَيْدُ بْنُ إِسْحَاقَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا سَيْفُ بْنُ عُمَرَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنِي سَعْدُ بْنُ طَرِيفٍ , عَنِ الْأَصْبَغِ بْنِ نُبَاتَةَ قَالَ: قَالَ عَلِيُّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: &#8221; لَأَنَا حَرَّضْتُ عُمَرَ رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ , وَرَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ عَلَى قِيَامِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ , أَخْبَرْتُهُ أَنَّ فَوْقَ السَّمَاءِ السَّابِعَةِ حَظِيرَةً؛ يُقَالُ لَهَا: حَظِيرَةُ الْقُدُسِ , فِيهَا قَوْمٌ يُقَالُ لَهُمُ: الرُّوحُ , فَإِذَا جَاءَتْ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ اسْتَأْذَنُوا رَبَّهُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِي النُّزُولِ إِلَى الدُّنْيَا , فَلَا يَمُرُّونَ بِأَحَدٍ يُصَلِّي , أَوْ يَسْتَقْبِلُونَهُ فِي طَرِيقٍ إِلَّا أَصَابَهُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ بَرَكَةٌ قَالَ: فَقَالَ عُمَرُ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: إِذَنْ , وَاللَّهِ يَا أَبَا الْحَسَنِ , نَعْرِضُ النَّاسَ لِلْبَرَكَةِ , فَأَمَرَهُمْ بِالْقِيَامِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin abi Harith told us in Bab-ul-Sham: `Ubaydullah bin Ishaq told us: Sayf bin `Umar told us: Sa`d bin Tarif told us: from al-Asbagh bin Nubatah: `Ali bin abi Talib said: &#8220;I pushed `Umar may God have mercy on him to encourage the night prayers during the month of Ramadan, I told him that above the seventh sky is a garden called al-Quds and its dwellers are spirits; Whenever the night of Qadr came they take permission of their Lord to descend into the world. Every time they pass by a person praying he gets blessings.&#8221; `Umar responded: &#8220;If so, O aba al-Hasan, let us expose the people to these blessings.&#8221; He then told them to pray the night. (Al-Ibanah li Ibn Battah)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May God reward those who establish Taraweeh.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have previously covered in <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/07/20/response-to-open-challenge-to-the-sons-of-aisha/">another article</a> that there is much doubt regarding whether A’isha permitted the suckling of adults. However, the stubbornness of some has led us to writing a follow-up article that explains an aspect that is often overlooked by those that hold the opinion that A’isha was a source of sexual perversion. Below, we shall provide some background for this issue for those that are unaware of the <em>fiqh</em> of the matter. This short article is written with the assumption, <strong>for the sake of the argument,</strong> that A’isha did believe that this act was permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is known from the Qur’an that suckling is only for two year old infants (2:233) and that such a matter leads to prohibition between a wet nurse (a women who breastfeeds infants) and whomever she is suckling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We find in the Qur’an, “<strong>Forbidden</strong> to you are your mothers and your daughters and our sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts and brothers’ daughters and sisters’ daughters <strong>and your mothers that have suckled you…</strong>” (4:23)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it is clear from the verse, all of the above women are forbidden upon a man. It other words, if one suckles from a wet nurse, it then become impermissible for him to become married to her. In other words, suckling prohibits sexual activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, one cannot claim that the view that is attributed to A’isha is proof of sexual perversion. Rather, this view states that it is permissible for a man to get married and have intercourse with a woman EXCEPT IF he suckles from her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hypothetical Scenarios</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To further illustrate the point, we provide a hypothetical scenario. The scenarios revolve around a man with some religious awareness who cares about Islamic law. Those that don’t wouldn’t even care about suckling laws let alone the laws of marriage before carrying out their desires.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Scenario 1</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man wants to get married to a wet nurse. According to the traditional <em>fatwa</em> that does not hold that suckling makes a woman forbidden upon a man, the act of <em>suckling</em> is <em>haram</em>. However, he can get married to her after suckling since this has no affect on his marriage. In other words, he sins, but the marriage is intact.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Scenario 2</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man wants to get married to a wet nurse. He decides to take the ruling that is attributed to A’isha. He suckles from her, which in turn prevents him from ever getting married to her. In other words, the suckling is permissible, but any form of sexual activity<strong>, <u>including marriage</u></strong>, thereon out is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the scenarios above in mind, it becomes clear that the opinion that has been attributed to A’isha limits sexual activity more than the traditional opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We once again advise readers to refer to our <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2013/07/20/response-to-open-challenge-to-the-sons-of-aisha/">another article</a> which provides strong evidences that A’isha did not hold this opinion. We hope that objective Shias can contemplate upon the basic argument that we have provided instead of emotionally accusing the wife of the Prophet – peace be upon him – of sexual perversion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be up our dear readers, in this article we have a very important story to share that touches on several sensitive topics such as Taqiyyah, Fadak and Imamah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twelvers claim the Caliphs usurped the rights of Ahlul-Bayt and stole the lands of Fadak and more importantly the divine leadership. Thus they accuse every Caliph after the Prophet (saw) of being an evil thief who oppressed Ahlul-Bayt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahlul-Sunnah say, if these evil Imams stole the rights of Ahlul-Bayt then why didn&#8217;t the heads of Ahlul-Bayt retrieve these stolen properties when they themselves became Imams? It is commonly known historically that neither `Ali nor al-Hasan or any of the others reversed the judgement of the &#8220;oppressors&#8221; and reclaimed Fadak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To counter this obvious contradiction, the Shia invented a narration and placed it in their books. The authentic Shia tradition states that: &#8220;We Ahlul-Bayt do not take back anything which was taken away from us unjustly or through oppression.&#8221; [`Ilal al-Shara&#8217;i` by al-Saduq]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now if this sounds fishy or nonsensical to you, then you have every right to feel this way since the only reason they fabricated this is to be the excuse for why the Hashemites never reclaimed their &#8220;stolen properties.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This however, is a lie because the fabricators were not familiar with Islamic history nor the stories and character of the heads of the Hashemite household. Below, we will quote a Sahih Hadith from one of the earliest Islamic sources and prophetic-biography the Seerah of Ibn Ishaq.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was an alliance between certain clans in Makkah called &#8220;Al-Fudul&#8221;. Those who formed this alliance are Banu Hashim, Banu al-Muttalib, Taym bin Murrah, Asad and Zuhrah who all gathered in the house of Ibn Jud`an. They agreed to stand up and support any resident or guest in their city if he faces oppression until they get their rights back. The Qurashi tribe called their alliance Hilf-ul-Fudul.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">قال ابن إسحاق : وحدثني يزيد بن عبد الله بن أسامة بن الهادي الليثي أن محمد بن إبراهيم بن الحارث التيمي حدثه : أنه كان بين الحسين بن علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنهما ، وبين الوليد بن عتبة بن أبي سفيان والوليد يومئذ أمير على المدينة أمره عليها عمه معاوية  بن أبي سفيان رضي الله عنه منازعة في مال كان بينهما بذي المروة . فكان الوليد تحامل على الحسين رضي الله عنه في حقه لسلطانه ، فقال له الحسين : أحلف بالله لتنصفني من حقي أو لآخذن سيفي ، ثم لأقومن في مسجد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ثم لأدعون بحلف الفضول . قال : فقال عبد الله بن الزبير ، وهو عند الوليد حين قال الحسين رضي الله عنه ما قال : وأنا أحلف بالله لئن دعا به لآخذن سيفي ، ثم لأقومن معه حتى ينصف من حقه أو نموت جميعا . قال : فبلغت المسور بن مخرمة بن نوفل الزهري ، فقال مثل ذلك وبلغت عبد الرحمن بن عثمان بن عبيد الله التيمي فقال مثل ذلك . فلما بلغ ذلك الوليد بن عتبة أنصف الحسين من حقه حتى رضي</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn Ishaq said: I was told by Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Usamah bin al-Hadi al-Laythi that Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin al-Harith al-Taymi told him: After Mu`awiyah appointed his nephew al-Walid bin `Utbah as governor of al-Madinah, there was a dispute between al-Walid and al-Husayn bin `Ali concerning some property in Dhi-Marwah. Al-Walid had abused his authority to push al-Husayn away from his right so al-Husayn told him: &#8220;By God, either you rule with justice or I shall carry my sword to the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) Masjid and call on the alliance of al-Fudul!&#8221; `Abdullah bin al-Zubayr who was also present said: &#8220;I too swear, that if al-Husayn calls on us then I shall raise my sword until he gets justice or we all die.&#8221; The news reached al-Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdul-Rahman bin `Uthman bin `Ubaydullah al-Taymi so they both said the same. Upon this, al-Walid bin `Utbah backed-away then gave al-Husayn his property.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, al-Husayn&#8217;s right was usurped by the governor al-Walid during Mu`awiyah&#8217;s reign. Instead of acting like a weirdo such as in Shia narrations, we find al-Husayn acting the way anybody who read his biography expects. He called on his allies and threatened to bring back his stolen land even if by force so the governor returned it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason we bring this up, is because Sunni and Shia historians all agree that Fadak was not in possession of Banu Hashim at the time. Shia claim it was stolen property, so why didn&#8217;t al-Husayn rebel with the sword and reclaim Fadak for himself and his relatives? Was that random property in Dhul-Marwah more valuable than Fadak that he wished to die in its defense? In the same context, why not raise the sword to return the Khilafah to banu Hashim?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is, Husayn viewed al-Walid&#8217;s action as an act of transgression so he stood up for truth. On the other hand, Husayn and his family respected the Ijtihad of the first three Caliphs when it comes to Fadak and accepted their final verdict.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, we hear Shia criticizing other Muslims during Mut`ah debates concerning the Misyar marriage. Most Shia who criticize do not understand the laws of that particular marriage nor do they understand what their own sect teaches in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below we will explain briefly about Misyar then quote relevant scholarly opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is Misyar an obligatory duty or prophetic-tradition?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin with a major difference, we can say that Mut`ah according to Shia is a recommended act that is praised and glorified in their traditions as well as being widespread and an integral part of Tashayyu`. On the other hand, Misyar marriage is an unpopular form of marriage in the Islamic world, Ahlul-Sunnah do not agree on its validity and so the Sunni can simply deem it as forbidden and reject it whereas the Shia cannot reject Mut`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why is it called Misyar?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a man living in Madinah often travels to Makkah for business or trade, he already has one wife in Madinah he lives with yet he wishes to take another wife in Makkah so he can be with her during his long stays. This will cause an issue as the man won&#8217;t be able to divide his time justly between both women. However, if the second woman in Makkah accepts to give up her time in favor of the first wife then the issue is resolved. This marriage is called Misyar since it is derived from the root al-Sayr &#8220;السير&#8221;, it means to march or travel in Arabic. Thus, the man travels from Madinah to Makkah to visit his second wife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the definition of Misyar marriage?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a lawful marriage contract that meets all the necessary conditions for marriage. However, the husband or wife willingly accept to drop some of their marital rights such as: Housing, cohabitation, expenditure, sexual intercourse or anything else that may encourage the other side to marry them or remain married to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The legality of Misyar marriage:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the above, Misyar marriage is a normal marriage but with condition(s) attached. The condition states that one of the two sides must willingly drop a right that the religion guarantees. The Dhahiri school among Ahlul-Sunnah reject any condition(s) that cancel religious marital rights and so Misyar in all its forms is rejected by them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other schools of thought among Ahlul-Sunnah disagree, since there is a concept of a woman dropping her right in favor of her husband. God says in His Book: {Give women their dowries freely, but if they are pleased to offer you any of it, consume it with wholesome appetite.} [4:4]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When such a condition is placed as part of the marriage contract, opinions are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Dhahiri school as well as al-Shafi`i in one report both deem the contract and marriage altogether annulled. The evidence they hold is the prophetic-saying: &#8220;Every condition not backed by God&#8217;s Book is void.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The main Shafi`i view, a report from the Hanbali Madhab as well as the Madhab of al-Thawri use the same evidence reported above but conclude that the marriage is valid while only the condition is void.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- A report from Ahmad, the Madhab of al-Awza`i, Ibn Sirin, al-Hasan, `Ata&#8217; as well as the Hanafi scholars all state that both the marriage and the condition are valid since the Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The condition most worthy of being fulfilled is that which is made (to the wife) before marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, everyone agrees that placing such conditions has both its positives and negatives depending on what the conditions may be. This is why there is a wide variety of opinions that one needs not get into in this brief article.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below we will quote some religious verdicts by contemporary Shia scholars to clarify their stance on Misyar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though we have in our possession Fatwas by grand Ayatulla al-Sistani and grand Ayatulla al-Ruhani, both of whom deem Misyar as permissible yet we won&#8217;t include them since they are not contained in their books but simply on their official websites and are subject to change and removal.</p>
<p>Grand Ayatulla Sadiq al-Shirazi in the book &#8220;Jami` al-Masa&#8217;il&#8221; Dar-ul-`Ulum pg.362:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>س : ما هو حكم الزواج المسيار وهو زواج دائم تسقط الزوجة فيها بعض حقوقها كحق المضاجعة والنفقة والإرث وغيرها ؟</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>الجواب</strong><br />
<strong>لا يضر بصحة الزواج الدائم أسقاط الزوجين أو احدهما بعض الحقوق الجائز إسقاطها دون مثل الإرث فالأظهر عدم صحة إسقاطه</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>يعلق محشي الكتاب في الهامش</strong><br />
<strong>الإمام الشيرازي الراحل (قده) : صحيح . ولكن تسقط به بعض الحقوق كحق المضاجعة والنفقة ولا يسقط الارث وأمثاله</strong></p>
<p>[Q: What is the ruling of the Misyar marriage which is a permanent marriage where the wife drops some of her rights such as the right of intercourse, allowance, inheritance etc?</p>
<p>Answer: Permanent marriage is not affected if one or both spouses dropped some rights. Except inheritance, it seems that this must not be dropped.</p>
<p>In the footnote we read this commentary by the late Imam Shirazi: &#8220;The above is true, some rights might be dropped such as intercourse and expenditure but not the likes of inheritance.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Shaykh Ayyub al-Ha&#8217;iri in &#8220;Mawsu`at Zawaj-ul-Mut`ah&#8221; Dar-ul-Jawadayn, pg.51-52:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>المطلب الخامس : زواج المسيار</strong><br />
<strong>وهذا الزواج يقوم على أساس العقد الشرعي والإشهاد وتمسية المهر وقد اختلف علماء السنة في جوازه فجوزه بعض علماء السنة بحجة أنه ناتج عن عقد صحيح وإشهاد ورضى الولي غير أن بعضهم منعه بحجة أنه يشترط في النكاح الشرعي الإعلان والإشهار ولا يكفي الإعلان أمام شاهدين ومن هنا فهو زواج باطل</strong><br />
<strong>أما الشيعة الإمامية فحيث إنهم لا يشترطون في الزواج الإشهاد والإعلان بل يتوقف الزواج عندهم على العقد الشرعي وتسمية المهر وموافقة الولي للباكر فصحته واضحة وتنازل المرأة عن حقها في النفقة والمبيت لا ينافي صحة هذا النوع من الزواج. &#8230;.ولكن كيف كان هو جائز شرعا عند الإمامية</strong></p>
<p>[The fifth topic: Misyar marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This marriage is based on a lawful contract, witnesses and designation of a dowry. However, Sunnah scholars differed on its validity. Some of them permitted it since the contract was proper with the presence of witnesses, permission of guardian etc&#8230; Some of them forbade it since the lawful marriage must be publicly declared and it is not sufficient to limit it to two witnesses so they viewed it as corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the Imami Shia, they do not consider witnesses and public announcement as necessary. Shia only require a legal contract, a designated dowry and the acceptance of a virgin&#8217;s guardian. Therefore, it (i.e Misyar) is clearly valid and it matters not if the woman wishes to drop her right of expenditure or housing&#8230; either way, it is permissible according to Imamiyyah.]</p>
<p>Sayyid Muhammad `Ali al-Husayni al-Lubnani in &#8220;Haqiqat Zawaj-ul-Misyar wa Mashru`iyyat al-Mut`ah&#8221; Dar-ul-Mahajjah, he begins in the sixth research topic by citing the evidence for the validity of this marriage:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>ويدل على جواز مثل ذلك قوله تبارك وتعالى: وَإِنِ امْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِنْ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزاً أَوْ إِعْرَاضاً فَلا جُنَاحَ عَلَيهِمَا أَنْ يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحاً وَالصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ والصلح هنا إنما يتم بإسقاط الزوجة ما لها في ذمة زوجها لها من الحقوق والواجبات طمعاً ورغبةً منها في بقائها واستمرار علاقتها به</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[This is permissible as evidenced by God&#8217;s words: {If a woman fear rebelliousness or aversion in her husband, there is no fault in them if the couple set things right between them; right settlement is better} [4:128] The settlement here is for the woman to drop a right that binds her husband or a duty he must fulfill in order to remain with him in the relationship.]</p>
<p>He quotes supporting evidence from the narrations of the Imams:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>وقول الإمام الرضا : وأمّا النشوز فقد يكون من الرجل ويكون من المرأة، فأمّا الذي من الرجل فهو يريد طلاقها فتقول: أمسكني ولك ما عليك، وقد وهبت ليلتي لك، ويصطلحان على ذلك</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>وقول الإمام الصادق: من تزوج امرأة فلها ما للمرأة من النفقة والقسمة ، ولكنه إن تزوّج إمرأة فخافت منه نشوزاً وخافت أن يتزوّج عليها أو يطلقها فصالحته من حقها على شيء من نفقتها أو قسمتها فإن ذلك جائز لا بأس به</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>ويضاف إلى ذلك ما ورد من استحباب تصدق الزوجة على زوجها بمهرها وغيره قبل الدخول وبعده كقول النبي الأكرم : أيما امرأة تصدقت على زوجها بمهرها قبل أن يدخل بها إلا كتب الله لها بكل دينار عتق رقبة، قيل: يا رسول الله فكيف بالهبة بعد الدخول؟ قال: إنما ذلك من المودة والألفة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>وقوله : ثلاث من النساء يرفع الله عنهن عذاب القبر، ويكون محشرهن مع فاطمة بنت محمد: امرأة صبرت على غيرة زوجها، وامرأة صبرت على سوء خلق زوجها، وإمرأة وهبت صداقها لزوجها يعطي الله كلّ واحدة منهن ثواب ألف شهيد، ويكتب لكل واحدة منهن عبادة سنة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Imam al-Rida says in support: &#8220;As for &#8220;rebelliousness&#8221;, it can be either from the man or the woman. As for that of the man, it is when he wishes for divorce so she responds: &#8220;Keep me and I shall spare you, I free you from my night.&#8221; They settle on this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam al-Sadiq says: &#8220;Whoever marries a woman then she has a right to expenditure and equal share but if he marries a woman who fears his rebelliousness or that he may marry over her or divorce her, then she can settle with him by dropping a part of her expenses or shares and there&#8217;s no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Add to this the preference/recommendation of a wife who spends her dowry on her husband before consummation as the kind Prophet (saw) says: &#8220;Any woman who offers her dowry to her husband before consummation then God will bless her with the reward of freeing a slave for every Dinar&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And his (saw) saying: &#8220;Three women will be spared from the torment of the grave and granted a place with Fatimah bint Muhammad: A woman who puts up with her husband&#8217;s jealousy, a woman who is patient with her immoral husband and a woman who offers her wedding gift&#8230;&#8221;]</p>
<p>Finally, he quotes some Fatwas from major Shia scholars with regards to Misyar:</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>جواب مكتب سماحة السيد السيستاني</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>لا مانع منه لكن لاأثر للتنازل عن الإرث فعلاً، نعم يجوز اشتراط أن تعرض عن سهمها في وقته لصالح الورثة أوتهبه لهم فيجب عليها ذلك تكليفاً</strong></p>
<p>[Answer of the office of his eminence al-Sayyid al-Sistani:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no problem in this (i.e Misyar). However, there is no evidence for actually dropping her right to inheritance. Instead, it is permitted for them to place a condition about overlooking her share of inheritance when the time comes so others may consume it or she may acquire it then be obliged to offer it them.]</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>جواب سماحة المرجع الديني آية الله العظمى الشيخ جواد التبريزي حفظه الله</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>تنازل الزوجة (المسيار) عن حقها في النفقة والقسم (المبيت) لا بأس به وأما تنازلها عن حقها في الإرث فلا يصح، نعم إذا مات زوجها لها أن لا تطالب الورثة الباقين بحصتها وتتركها لهم ولا يجب عليها إخبار الورثة بترك حصتها لهم وإعراضها عنها والله العالم</strong></p>
<p>[Answer of his eminence the religious authority, grand Ayatulla Shaykh Jawad Tabrizi:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no harm in the wife giving up her right to expenditure and equal share but it&#8217;s not allowed to reject her right to inheritance. Of course, if her husband dies she is at liberty to not ask the other heirs about her share nor does she even need to inform others that she is entitled to receive a share, she may simply ignore it. God knows best.]</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>جواب سماحة المرجع الديني آية الله العظمى السيد محمد علي الأبطحي حفظه الله</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>لا مانع عنه</strong></p>
<p>[Answer of his eminence the religious authority, grand Ayatulla al-Sayyid Muhammad `Ali al-Abtahi:</p>
<p>There is no problem in this marriage.]</p>
<p>The author quotes similar Fatwas from other Shia religious authorities: Muhammad Taqi Bahjat, Safi al-Kalpaykani and Sayyid Muhammad Mufti al-Shi`ah.</p>
<p>With the above, we see that Misyar marriage is valid and acceptable by Shia standards and according to their scholars, with minor reservations by some concerning inheritance which an be settled with simple tweak.</p>

<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;">The following is a list of reports from various sources in which Al-Baqir narrates a tradition from Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari. The reports are not polemical nor reactionary in nature, but rather, they revolve around specific matters of Islamic jurisprudence. The purpose of the article to disprove the Shia claim that Al-Baqir’s knowledge was gained only from his forefathers. As we will see below, he narrated often from Jabir, who was not an infallible.</span></p>

<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;">Upon investigating the diversity of these above reports, there are only a few possible conclusions that the Shia reader may arrive to. Perhaps the most likely of these conclusions is that these narrations are fabrications. </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;">In response, we remind the objective reader that the narrations do not include any polemical or reactionary material. These narrations are pretty uncontroversial for anyone to assume that they were fabrications. </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;">The irrational Shia reader may argue that the students of Jafar and Al-Baqir were so diabolical, that they purposefully chose uncontroversial material in order to get the masses to accept that the two men took knowledge from fallible men. Our response is to simply point to the obvious, which is that the narrators that have done this are not few in number. Furthermore, we have only quoted the narrations of Al-Baqir from Jabir, and we did not include his narrations from his other teachers. Surely, the number of students would be multiplied if those narrations were added into the equation. </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="tm5" style="color: #000000;">The most obvious answer is the most correct one: <strong>Al-Baqir learned aspects of his religion from Jabir.</strong> </span></p>

Even though it is now a common practice in Shia mosques, there was once a time in which Shia Azan’s did not include, “I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we will be listing the evidences against this false azan. We also took a look at Shia material online on this topic and decided to deal with some allegation by <a href="http://www.shiapen.com/fiqh/ali-un-wali-allah/adhan-call-to-prayers.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen</a> regarding the Sunni Azan.</p>

</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Intellect VS the Shia Azan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is known by Ahlul Sunnah that the call to prayer was established by the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , and it is false to add anything onto it. Many Shias will agree with this view, though they may expand it to include the Imams. However, they will be surprised that there are no narrations in which the Imams instructed the people to add the words “I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah,” into the Azan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/08/shia-azan-examined/minaret-cc-dbking-p/" rel="attachment wp-att-3496 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3496 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/minaret-cc-dbking-p-150x150.jpg" alt="minaret-cc-dbking-p" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/minaret-cc-dbking-p-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/minaret-cc-dbking-p-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/minaret-cc-dbking-p-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/minaret-cc-dbking-p-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Shias may argue that Ali truly is the Wali of Allah, and therefore, it is permissible to add his name into the Azan. Our response to that is that even though a matter is true, it does not make it permissible to add it to the Azan. If the Prophet – peace be upon him – and the Twelve Imams did not think of adding it, then why do modern Shias feel that they know better?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, if the argument is as simple as: “One can add any true testimony into the azan”, then why not recite the following into the azan as well?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Below, we propose a new Shia azan:</strong></h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Al-Hasan bin Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Al-Hussain bin Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Ali bin Al-Hussain is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Mohammad bin Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice).</li>
<li>I testify that Ja’afar bin Mohammad is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Musa bin Ja’afar is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Ali bin Musa is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Mohammad bin Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Ali bin Mohammad is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Al-Hasan bin Ali is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
<li>I testify that Mohammad bin Al-Hasan Al-Mahdi is the Wali of Allah. (twice)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why stop there though? Why not also bare witness that Adam is a prophet of Allah? Let us not forget Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and Eisa. There are around twenty other prophets mentioned by name in the Qur’an, and they should be added to according to this flawed Shia logic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inshallah we have made our point. The Azan is not the practice that should be changed by the whims of men and societies. It is legislated by Allah and should not be tampered with. Tampering with the call to prayer is a very obvious innovation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Opinion of Al-Saduq regarding the Shia Azan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most outspoken scholars against the Shia Azan was Ibn Babawayh Al-Saduq. He said in his Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh 1/137, one of the main four Shia books, after quoting a hadith that <u>does not</u> include the addition of “I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the authentic azan. Nothing should be added or removed from it. <strong>As for the <em>mufawidha</em></strong>, may Allah curse them, they fabricated narrations and added to the Azan, “Mohammad and family of Mohammad are the best of creation,” twice. In some narrations, after “I testify that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah,” <strong>they added, “I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah,” twice. </strong>Some also narrated, “I testify that Ali, truly the Commander of the Believers, is the Wali of Allah.,” twice. There is no doubt that Ali is the Wali of Allah, and that he is the Commander of the Believers truly, and that Mohammad and his family are the best of the creation, but this is not a part of the Azan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I mentioned this so that it would be known that this is the Azan of the <em>muwafidha</em>, those that have falsely made themselves appear to be from us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Who are the <em>Mufawidha?</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the readers that are unaware, the <em>mufawidha</em> are an ancient group of Shias that believed that Allah gave His powers to the “infallibles” and gave them full control of the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Nawbakhti in his Firaq Al-Shia (p. 61) states: “As for those that believe in <em>tafweedh</em>, they believed that the Eternal One gave one person, who is complete, without addition or subtraction, the control (of all things) and the ability to create. This person is Mohammad, Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, Al-Hussain, and the rest of the Imams.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He continues (p. 61): “(They believe that) Mohammad created the heavens, the earth, the mountains, man, <em>jinn</em>, and the whole world.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These people, O’ Shias, are the people that invented the addition of “I testify that Ali is the Wali of Allah,” so cease from imitating these polytheists, and turn their backs on this innovative Shia Azan.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tathweeb (Prayer is better than Sleep / Al-Salatu Khairun min Al-Nawm)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the issue of Tathweeb has nothing to do with the Shia Azan, Shias often bring it up to suggest that Sunnis are innovators. Firstly, there is not a single authentic report in which Tathweeb was invented by Omar. Shiapen provided narrations from Tawus (106), Malik (179 AH), Omar bin Hafs (from the Atba’ Al-Tabi’een) to suggest that this invention occurred during the time of Omar. Without even looking into the chains of narrations to these men, we find that all of these reports are disconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, we find Tathweeb in Shia sources, like Al-Istibsaar 1/228 and Wasa’il Al-Shia 5/425, in multiple hadiths from the Imams. Even though Al-Tusi and Al-Hur Al-Amili suggested that these narrations are <em>taqiyyah</em>, we find that Tathweeb was accepted by Ibn Al-Junaid, who was one of the leading Shia early scholars of <em>fiqh</em>. See Al-Duroos Al-Shar’eeya by Al-Shaheed Al-Awal (p. 162). Ibn Al-Junaid clearly did not believe that this was an innovation of Omar. If he did, then he wouldn’t have deemed this addition to the call to prayer as permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important to be aware of the distinction between both cases. Tathweeb is based upon narrations that have been attributed to the Prophet – peace be upon him – in works like Sunan Abi Dawud, Al-Tirmithi, Al-Nasa’ee, and Ibn Majah. The Shia Azan though, is based on a reaction against Sunnism, for Shias know that the Imams did not teach it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hayya Ala Khair-il-Amal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias sometimes quote narrations from Sunni books in order to substantiate their claims to the addition of: Hayya ‘Ala Khair-il-‘amal. The narrations that are often quoted are from Ibn Abi Shaybah’s Musannaf 1/195-196 from Ali bin Al-Hussain Zain Al-Abideen and Ibn Omar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first narration from Ali Zain Al-Abideen shows him calling to prayer. Al-Baqir narrates, “During the call, after reaching: Hayya ‘ala Al-Falaah, he would say: Hayya ‘ala khair-il-amal. He’d say: This is the <strong>first Azan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias, due to their preconceptions, assume that what is meant is that this was in the original Azan, but that it was removed by Sunnis, namely Omar. However, we do not believe that this is the case. The apparent meaning is that this is the first Azan of Fajr. The opinion of the existence of two Azans for Fajr is held by the majority of Ahlul Sunnah, and is held by Malik, Al-Shafi’ee, Al-Awza’ee, Ahmad, Ishaq, and Abu Thawr. See Al-Awsat by Ibn Al-Munthir 3/162.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is supported by Ibn Omar’s narration in Mushkil Athar Al-Tahawi #5308, in which Nafi’ narrates that he used to say in the <strong>first Azan</strong>: Al-Salatu khairun min al-Nawm, after Al-Falaah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is also supported by the narration that Shias often quote from Ibn Omar as well, from Ibn Abi Shaybah. Nafi’ narrated from Ibn Omar that he used to say in his prayer, “Al-Salatu khairun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep),” or maybe he would say, “Hayya ‘ala khair-il-‘amal.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This supporting narration by Ibn Omar clearly shows that he would interchange between the two wordings. The wording used here clearly supports the view that Ali Zain Al-Abideen used to say, “Hayya ‘ala khair-il-‘amal,” during the first Fajr Azan only, unlike the Shias who say it during all Azans.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the context of what we have established and with the last point in mind, Shias may ask: Why not add ““Hayya ‘ala khair-il-‘amal” to your Fajr Azan then? The answer is simple. The <em>shari’ah</em> to us is not based on the actions of Ibn Omar or Zain Al-Abideen. Rather, we are followers of Mohammad – peace be upon him &#8211; .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunni practices are not based on their reactions to others sects. Their practices are not based upon what appeals to their biases. Unsurprisingly, Sunnis are following the Qur’an and Sunnah down to the letter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, once again, we call our intelligent Shia readers to turn their backs on the Shia Azan and to accept the Azan of the Prophet – peace be upon him – , which can be found exclusively in the Sunni sources, from his <em>mu’azzins</em> Bilal and Abu Mahthoora, may Allah be pleased with them both.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Muawiyah and Talbiya at Arafa</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a response to <a href="http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/muawiya/phantom-merits.html" rel="external nofollow">Shiapen</a> and Slave of Ahlubait&#8217;s accusation (which can be found on his <a href="https://ahlubait.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/mawia-leaving-sunnah-in-grudge-for-imam-ali-authentic-narration/" rel="external nofollow">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.wilayat.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2651:mawia-leaving-sunnah-in-grudge-for-imam-ali-authentic-narration&amp;catid=187:muawiyyah&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=108" rel="external nofollow">Wilayat.net</a>) against Mu’awiyah of abandoning the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration used to suggest this is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Saeed bin Jubair said: ‘We were with ibn Abbas in Arafa and he said to me: ‘Oh Saeed, why don’t I hear the people performing talbya?’ I replied: ‘They are afraid of Muawiya’. Then ibn Abbas went out from his cottage and said: ‘I respond to your call, Oh Allah I respond to your call, they abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali (ra).</strong><strong><br />
</strong>1. Sunan Nasai, Volume 5 page 253 Tradition 3019</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> 2.  Sahih Ibn Khuzaima, Volume 4 page 260 Tradition 2830</span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> 3. Mustadrak al-Hakim, Volume 1 pages 364-365</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before even refuting this allegation, those that don’t speak the Arabic language need to be aware that the term <em>talbiya</em> is the call that we find the pilgrims practicing during Hajj, in which they shout: <em>Labayk Allahuma labaik</em>, meaning: O’ my Lord, I’ve answered your call and I’m at your service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the Shias use this tradition to suggest that Mu’awiyah not only abandoned the Sunnah, but that he was against <em>dhikr</em> as a whole. However, simply by critically examining this narration, we arrive at a completely different conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, there is nothing in the narration that suggests that Mu’awiyah was anti-<em>dhikr</em> or anti-Islam from this narration. Rather, the narration revolves around the time in which <em>talbiya</em> is to be made. According to Mu’awiyah, <em>talbiya</em> is made at Hajj, but not at Arafa in specific.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why we find Ibn Abi Shayba 3/356 including this hadith in a chapter that he titled: <em>Takbir </em>or <em>talbiya</em>, what is better during Arafa?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter, he included several narrations that suggest both views. One includes a narration from Ibn Umar saying that he prefers <em>takbir</em>. In a narration from Abu Ja’afar, we find him stopping <em>talbiya</em> on his way to Arafa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another chapter 3/248 he quotes that Al-Qasim bin Mohammad bin Abi Bakr and A’isha did not make <em>talbiya</em> when on their way to Arafa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another matter that should catch the reader’s attention is Ibn Abbas’ specific wording: “They abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali.” Now, why would Ibn Abbas name Ali in particular? This suggests that <em>talbiya</em> was not as common at Arafa before Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is supported by a narration from Musanaf Ibn Abi Shayba 3/356, where in which <em>talbiya</em> was heard. Surprised, they asked, “Who is making <em>talbiya</em> on this day?!” When they found out that it was Ibn Mas’ud, they went silent. Ibn Mas’ud died during the time of Uthman, which suggests that he made <em>talbiya</em> before Ali’s time, and yet, the practice as not too common.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, we can conclude that Mu’awiyah did not intentionally go against the <em>sunnah</em>, but rather, acted upon what he believed was the correct Hajj etiquette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, we find that the Umawi government, under Umar bin Abdulaziz, did the exact opposite of Mu’awiyah, as per Muwatta Malik #660. When he heard people making <em>takbir</em>, he sent his guards to call out to the people, “O’ people! Make <em>talbiya</em> (instead)!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which action is more correct, the purpose of this article was to not to analyze the correct position, but rather, to demonstrate that Mu’awiyah made <em>ijtihad</em>, as did others before him, and held the belief that the proper Hajj protocol was to make <em>takbir</em> instead of <em>talbiya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no evidences in the narration that remotely suggest that he purposefully went against the <em>sunnah</em>, or took this position to contradict Ali’s actions.</p>
