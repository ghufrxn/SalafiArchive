<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen (Revision: 1.0.0)</p>



<p>It is mentioned in the work <em>‘Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen’</em> found on Answering-Ansar:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>It’s also written that Yaqoob held his brother feet’s in mercy, and when he had power he fought with GOD. (God Forbid)<br><br>These absurd accounts of GOD, can only be deemed to be fairy tales, Allah (swt) is all above all of these attributes, that the Jews and Christians have sought to ascribe to Him. Sadly if we examine Islam we will find that these same absurd beliefs are prevalent amongst the vast bulk of Islamic Sects, they believe that Allah (swt) has a physical body like humans have, that He (swt) has for e.g. Blood, Ears, Hands, legs etc. We read in <em>‘Al Milal wa al Nahal’</em> by Imam of Ahl’ul Sunnah Abdul Kareem Sharastani that Abu Dawood Zuhri and his followers adhered to this type of belief.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_usool_5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.answering-ansar.org/fiqh/usool_al_deen/en/chap3.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.answering-ansar.org/fiqh/usool_al_deen/en/chap3.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This work, in actuality, is the English translation of Answering-Ansar’s mentor `Abd al-Karīm Mushtāq’s book, <em>Uşūl-i Dīn</em>, published and promoted&nbsp;on Answering-Ansar with additional notes.</p>



<p>However, it should be known that there is no one by the name of “Abu Dawood Zuhri.” This, in fact, is a result of the Answering-Ansar team’s lack of knowledge about major Islamic scholars because Mushtāq himself has mentioned the name in his original work as “Abū Dāwūd al-Žāhirī.” But ignorance is not limited to a single individual when it comes to <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> pseudo-polemicists, for he is Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd ibn `Alī al-Işfahānī al-Žāhirī (d. 275), not Abū Dāwūd as mentioned by Mushtāq.</p>



<p>Now, the question is, did Muĥammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm al-Shahrastānī (d. 548) state or relate that al-Žāhirī believed Allāh (swt) has a human-like physical body in <em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>?</p>



<p><strong>No</strong>, this is an outright lie.</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, al-Shahrastānī clearly states the complete opposite about al-Žāhirī in <em>al-Milal</em>. He says:</p>



<p>فأما أحمد بن حنبل وداود بن علي الاصفهاني وجماعة من أئمة السلف فجروا على منهاج السلف المتقدمين عليهم من أصحاب الحديث مثل مالك بن أنس ومقاتل بن سليمان وسلكوا طريق السلامة فقالوا نؤمن بما ورد به الكتاب والسنة ولا نتعرض للتأويل بعد أن نعلم قطعاً أن الله عز وجل لا يشبه شيئاً من المخلوقات وأن كل ما تمثل في الوهم فإنه خالقه ومقدوره وكانوا يحترزون عن التشبيه إلى غاية أن قالوا من حرك يده عند قراءة قوله تعالى خلقت بيدي أو أشار بإصبعيه عند روايته قلب المؤمن بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن وجب قطع يده وقلع إصبعيه</p>



<p><strong>“As for Aĥmad ibn Ĥanbal, <u>Dāwūd ibn `Alī al-Işfahānī</u> and a group&nbsp;of <em>Imāms</em>&nbsp;from the predecessors, they took the methodological course of the early predecessors from the people of narrations—such as Mālik ibn Anas and Muqātil ibn Sulaymān—and followed the safe path.</strong></p>



<p><strong>They said: ‘We believe in whatever is mentioned in the Book and the <em>Sunna</em>, and we do not come to grips with the interpretation; after we certainly know that Allāh, the Powerful and Exalted, <u>does not resemble anything from the creation</u> and that all what is portrayed in imagination is created and foreordained.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>And they used to <u>guard themselves from anthropomorphism</u> to such a degree, that they said: ‘Whosoever moved his hand during the recitation of </strong><strong>His statement: <em>‘…I created with My hands?’</em> [38:75] or pointed with his two fingers during his narration: ‘The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the Merciful,’ his hand should be cut and his two fingers removed.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm al-Shahrastānī (d. 548), volume 1, page 104 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>It is clear from the quote above that al-Shahrastānī does not state that al-Žāhirī believed Allāh (swt) has a human-like body or anything to that effect, but he rather states that al-Žāhirī was against anthropomorphism.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that Mushtāq—whose dishonesty has been uncovered <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">earlier</a> as well—has lied about <em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>. This evidently demonstrates how truthful and reliable is the information promoted in the works of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> propagandists, and particularly on Answering-Ansar.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt)&nbsp;who gives success, and blessings and peace be on the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef? (Revision: 1.0.0)</p>



<p>Whenever someone raises a question about a narration promoting the belief in distortion of the Holy Qur’ān found in major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts, their apologists immediately embrace deceptive methods&nbsp;to free themselves from all burden. One of these methods is to say that neither did any of their scholars ever compile a work of narrations that he himself considered entirely authentic nor did any of them ever claim such a thing about any of the texts.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team forwards these very same notions in the following words:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih. Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih. Likewise Sheikh Muhammad Jawwad Ma`tiya states the hadith books of our school like Al Kafi, Istibsar, Al Tahdib, Man La Yuhizar al Faiqh contain both Sahih and weak hadiths. Similarly, the books on Fiqha written by our scholars contain material that have mistakes. It would therefore be correct to assert that according to the Shia of Ali [as] there is no book besides that Holy Quran which is flawless from its beginning till its end. One cannot therefore cite the tradition from the Shia hadith book against the Shia of Ali [as] as when the Shia reject the authenticity of such a hadith. In order to corroborate our stance, it would suffice to say that Shiekh Muhammad Yaqub Kuleini (d 329 H) recorded 16200 hadiths in his book ‘Al Kafi’. The scholars have categorized these hadiths in respect of Rijal under five different categories i.e Sahih, Mawthiq, Qawi, Hasan, Daeef [weak]. It is therefore evident that since scholars applied this division to our principle book Al Kafi, that is deemed as reliable and a source of Islamic instructions, the authority and authenticity of other books is self clarified.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4-5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4-5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Many unwary Muslims are deceived by these two expressions due to their lack of knowledge about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> literature and scholars, but those who have spent years as <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> or studying them know very well that these are nothing but patent lies.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has proposed two notions here:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>No <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> author ever claimed that all the narrations compiled in his book “were correct and Sahih.”</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>None among the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars of narrations and jurisprudence testified that any specific <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> text containing narrations “were all acceptable and Sahih.”</li>
</ul>



<p>The following revealing set of facts will show the readers that both these claims are actually lies forwarded by the Answering-Ansar team to deceive Muslims.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction of the Four Books</h2>



<p>Before moving on with the facts, readers should know that the most authoritative compilations after the Qur’ān, according to <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī <u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em>, are what they call <em>al-Kutub al-Arba`a</em> [“The Four Books”]. These four compilations are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em> <em>fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329)</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> of Ibn Bābawayh al-Şadūq al-Qummī (d. 381)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Aĥkām fī <u>Sh</u>arĥ al-Muqni`a</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Istibşār fī mā I<u>kh</u>talaf min al-A<u>kh</u>bār</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ĥusayn Baĥr al-`Ulūm (d. 1422) writes about these four books in his introduction to <em>Tal<u>kh</u>īs al-<u>Sh</u>āfī</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī:</p>



<p>إن الإجتهاد لدى الشيعة مرتكز على الكتب الأربعة الكافي للكليني ومن لا يحضره الفقيه للصدوق والتهذيب والاستبصار للطوسي وهي من الأصول المسلمة كالصحاح الستة لدى العامة</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, scholarly endeavour, according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, is dependant on the Four Books: <em>al-Kāfī</em> of al-Kulaynī, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> al-Şadūq, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb </em>and <em>al-Istibşār</em> of al-Ţūsī. These are from the accepted principle books that are as the Six <em>Şiĥāĥ</em> are according to the Commoners.”</strong></p>

<p>Let us now proceed:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kulaynī (d. 329) and <em>al-Kāfī</em></h2>



<p><em>al-Kāfī fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of the major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī is the most authoritative and renowned compilation of the Four Books. The author of this work, al-Kulaynī, believed that all the narrations in his work are authentic and correct, and that is the reason why he actually compiled it.</p>



<p>In the introduction of <em>al-Kāfī</em>, he explicitly said:</p>



<p>وقلت إنك تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب كاف يجمع فيه من جميع فنون علم الدين ما يكتفي به المتعلم ويرجع إليه المسترشد ويأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام والسنن القائمة التي عليها العمل وبها يؤدي فرض الله عز وجل وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وقلت لو كان ذلك رجوت أن يكون ذلك سببا يتدارك الله تعالى بمعونته وتوفيقه إخواننا وأهل ملتنا ويقبل بهم إلى مراشدهم</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving <u>correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)</u> and the upright and acted upon traditions from it—through which the compulsory duties of Allāh, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And you said: ‘If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allāh will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 8 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Following this, he said:</p>



<p>وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 9 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an explicit confirmation from al-Kulaynī that the reason he compiled <em>al-Kāfī</em> was so he can provide <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> with a book of authentic narrations that is sufficient for them—i.e. his book only contained correct reports according to him.</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Mahdī al-Āşifī writes about al-Kulaynī while discussing <em>al-Kāfī</em> in his epistle <em>Tarī<u>kh</u> Fiqh Ahl al-Bayt</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جمع رحمه الله في موسوعته هذه ما صح لديه من أحاديث الأئمة الهداة عليهم السلام</p>



<p><strong>“He—may Allāh have mercy on him—has collected what he found authentic from the narrations of the guiding <em>Imāms</em> (as) in this encyclopedia of his.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Furthermore, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū Ţālib al-Tajlīl al-Tabrīzī, author of the famous booklet translated as <em>‘</em><em>Spurious Arguments about the Shia</em>,<em>’</em> confirms this declaration of al-Kulaynī in the introduction to his book known as <em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāwī</em>.</p>



<p>He writes about al-Kulaynī and his <em>al-Kāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد صرح في مقدمته بصحة أحاديثه حيث قال وقلت تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب يأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام . . . . إلى أن قال وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction, when he said: ‘</strong><strong>Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)…’ to: ‘Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>This declaration of al-Kulaynī was so influential in history that it even led a group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars to use it as an argument for <em>their</em> belief in the immaculacy of the contents of <em>al-Kāfī</em>. Among them is al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of that group and an expert in the field of narrations, who staunchly believed in the correctness of all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>He states about the declaration of al-Kulaynī cited above:</p>



<p>وهو صريح أيضا في الشهادة بصحة أحاديث كتابه لوجوه منها قوله بالآثار الصحيحة ومعلوم أنه لم يذكر فيه قاعدة يميز بها الصحيح عن غيره لو كان فيه غير صحيح ولا كان اصطلاح المتأخرين موجودا في زمانه قطعا كما يأتي فعلم أن كل ما فيه صحيح باصطلاح القدماء بمعنى الثابت عن المعصوم بالقرائن القطعية أو التواتر</p>



<p><strong>“This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points.</strong></p>



<p><strong>One of these points is: His statement: ‘Authentic narrations.’ It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-<em>şaĥīĥ</em> narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will </strong><strong>be further explained.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><u>Kh</u></em><em>ātimat Tafşīl Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a ilá Taĥşīl Masā’il al-<u>Sh</u>arī`a</em>, of al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), volume 30, page 196 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> What al-Ĥurr means by “the terminology of later scholars” are the terminologies introduced with the categorization of narrations, in terms of their authenticity, that was not invented until the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> Islamic century. Before this categorization, the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars viewed the narrations to be either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. This will be further elaborated in this writing.</p>



<p>Opposing the view of this group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Mujāhid al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242) replied to this argument in the following words:</p>



<p>إن إخبار الكليني بصحة ما دونه في الكافي كما يمكن أن يكون باعتبار علمه بها وقطعه بصدورها عن الأئمة عليهم السلام فيجوز الاعتماد عليها والحال هذه كسائر أخبار العدول كذلك يمكن أن يكون باعتبار اجتهاده وظهورها عنده ولو بالدليل الظني فلا يجوز إذن الاعتماد عليه فإن ظن المجتهد لا يكون حجة على مثله كما هو الظاهر من الأصحاب بل ومن العقلاء وحيث لا ترجيح للاحتمال الأول وجب التوقف به لأن الشك في الشرط يوجب الشك في المشروط فيلزم التوقف</p>



<p><strong>“Indeed</strong><strong>, the testimony of al-Kulaynī concerning the authenticity of (the narrations) he has recorded in <em>al-Kāfī</em>, just as it is possible that it is in consideration of his knowledge and certainty of their issuance from the <em>Imāms</em> (as), in which case it is permissible to depend upon them and its status will be the same as of all the reports of just individuals, it is (also) possible that it is in consideration of his independent judgment [<em>ijtihād</em>] and their appearance to him on the basis of conjectural proof. In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [<em>mujtahid</em>] is not proof for those of the same stature, as it is obvious from other scholars, in fact, even from those with intellect.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And when there is no preference for the first possibility, it is incumbent to desist from holding on it because doubt about the condition necessitates doubt about what the condition is applied upon. Therefore, desistance is incumbent.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>Mafātīĥ al-Uşūl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242), page 332 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī leaves out al-Ţabāţabā’ī’s analogical justifications and puts it in simple words:</p>



<p>واعتقاد الكليني بصحة الرواية ليس من الحجج الشرعية إذ ليس هو معصوما عندنا</p>



<p><strong>“The belief of al-Kulaynī about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>Dirāsāt fī al-Makāsib al-Muĥarrama</em>, of Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī, volume 3, page 123 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in a nutshell, between the occurrence of inter-<em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> disputes on whether <em>al-Kāfī</em> is entirely correct or not, the fact remains that al-Kulaynī himself declared, and thus believed in, the authenticity of the narrations found in his book.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ibn Bābawayh (d.381) and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em></h2>



<p>Abū Ja`far ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar known as al-Shaykh al-Şadūq, also believed that all the narrations he has recorded in his compilation <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> are all authentic and correct. In fact, just as al-Kulaynī, he has himself declared their authenticity while mentioning the reason why he compiled the work.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh explicitly mentions in the introduction to <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> that he has compiled this work on narrations because another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of his era, Sharaf al-Dīn Ni`ma, requested him to author a condensed work dealing with jurisprudence, Islamic laws and the permitted and prohibited.</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<p>وصنفت له هذا الكتاب بحذف الأسانيد لئلا تكثر طرقه وإن كثرت فوائده ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>I have compiled this book for him without chains of transmission, so that its transmissions should not be too many while its benefits are abundant. I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, exalted is His power.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, of Ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī (d. 381), volume 1, page 2-3 [Qum]</li>

</ul>



<p>These words of Ibn Bābawayh are extremely obvious and show that he believed that all the narrations in his book are authentic and correct.</p>



<p>Contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and intellectual, Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, writes after quoting these words of Ibn Bābawayh:</p>



<p>ونصه هذا واضح وصريح في أنه يعتقد بصحة ما في كتابه ويراه حجة بينه وبين الله تعالى</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>This explicit statement of his is clear and unequivocal in showing that he believes in the authenticity of what is in his book, and views it to be proof between himself and Allāh the Exalted.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, page 217 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is further confirmed by al-Tabrīzī, who states about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>وقد صرح لصحة أحاديثه بقوله في مقدمته قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>with his statement: ‘I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is a proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another thing worthy of mention here is what is mentioned in the transcribed lectures of the contemporary Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Alī al-Sīstānī about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>إنه قدس سره قد شهد في مقدمة كتابه بصحة جميع ما رواه فيه حيث قال ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه إنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Verily, he—may Allāh sanctify his secret—has certified the authenticity of <em>all</em> that he has narrated in it, in the introduction, when he said: ‘I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, sacred is His mention and exalted is His power.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Qā`ida lā Đarar wa lā Đirār</em>, of `Alī al-Sīstānī, page 87 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is obvious from Ibn Bābawayh’s own words, the reason why he removed the chains of transmission from <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> is because he did not want to present any narration that was not authentic or proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] according to him, like other scholars usually did in their compilations. And since Ibn Bābawayh was one of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars and there were no terminologies of the later scholars during his time, it can easily be understood from his authentication that he viewed the narrations to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>However, in case the Answering-Ansar team customarily rejects all manners taught by the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> (ra) to impolitely accuse other “cults” of misinterpreting Ibn Bābawayh’s words, let us cite a few more statements of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who have acknowledged his view.</p>



<p>The major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), who was admired as the “teacher of all” by even the top scholar-marionettes of the Safavids, states in his <em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى رئيس المحدثين ثقة الإسلام محمد بن بابويه قدس الله روحه على متعارف المتقدمة في إطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن إليه ويعتمد عليه فحكم بصحة جميع ما أورده من الأحاديث في كتاب من لا يحضره الفقيه</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The head of the scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>īn</em>], the trustworthy of Islam, Muĥammad ibn Bābawayh—may Allāh sanctify his soul—has taken the <u>traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em></u>.<em>’</em> Thus, he has ruled the correctness of all the narrations he has mentioned in the book <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn wa Iksīr al-Sa`ādatayn</em>, of Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), page 269-270 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of high stature and author of over a hundred texts, Muĥammad Muĥsin al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī (d. 1091), also writes something fairly close in his voluminous <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى صاحبا كتابي الكافي والفقيه على متعارف المتقدمين في اطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن اليه ويعتمد عليه فحكما بصحة جميع ما أورداه في كتابيهما من الأحاديث وإن لم يكن كثير منه صحيحا على مصطلح المتأخرين</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The authors of the two books, <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, have taken the traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em>.<em>’</em> Thus, they have ruled the correctness of all the narrations they have mentioned in their books, even though many of them are not <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to the terminology of the later scholars.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>These quotes sufficiently demonstrate that like al-Kulaynī, Ibn Bābawayh too declared the authenticity of the narrations found in his book in the introduction, while being on the course of the early <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ţūsī (d. 460) and his <em>Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em></h2>



<p>This just leaves the last two of the Four Books. Our respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> brothers may find this hard to assimilate, but al-Ţūsī also confirmed the authenticity of these compilations of his.</p>



<p>al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī states in <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>أن مدار الأحكام الشرعية اليوم على هذه الأصول الأربعة وهي المشهود عليها بالصحة من مصنفها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>These four key books are the pivot of legal rulings today, and they are testified as correct by their compilers.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Similarly, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar Yūsuf al-Baĥrānī (d. 1186) also states while objecting about the opposing group of scholars from his own <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> school:</p>



<p>أن التوثيق والجرح الذي بنوا عليه تنويع الأخبار إنما أخذوه من كلام القدماء وكذلك الأخبار التي رويت في أحوال الرواة من المدح والذم إنما أخذوها عنهم فإذا اعتمدوا عليهم في مثل ذلك فكيف لا يعتمدون عليهم في تصحيح ما صححوه من الأخبار واعتمدوه وضمنوا صحته كما صرح به جملة منهم كما لا يخفى على من لاحظ ديباجتي الكافي والفقيه وكلام الشيخ في العدة وكتابي الأخبار</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The narrator commendation and condemnation, on which the categorization of reports was based, is obtained from the statements of the early scholars. Similarly, the reports that are related concerning the conditions of narrators in terms of praise and dispraise are (also) obtained from them.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If they have relied upon them [i.e. the early scholars] concerning a matter such as that, how is it that they do not rely upon them concerning the authenticity of the reports that they deemed correct, relied upon and ensured to be authentic as a score of them have (even) explicitly declared—something not hidden to he who has observed the introductions of <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, <u>and the words of <em>al-Shaykh</em> [al-Ţūsī] in <em>al-`Udda</em> and the two books of reports [i.e. <em>Tahdhīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>]</u>.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>These strong words of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that were only uncovered due to the fiery disputes that occurred between them concerning the categorization of narrations in terms of their authenticity, make the stance of the author of the four most authoritative books of narrations very clear—i.e. they viewed the narrations in their works to be authentic and correct.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted here that no one is arguing that what was considered a <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or correct narration among these four scholars is equivalent to what is defined as “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>” according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars today, for it is a known fact that the categorization of narrations followed by the majority of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arīs</em> today was not introduced until long after these four individuals and thus, as quoted from al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and Bahā’ al-Dīn, they were on the traditional course of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars concerning the categorization of narrations—i.e. it is either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>That being said, it has been evidently shown that these four scholars believed the narrations in their books to be correct or as they believed, “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>.” And what is being demonstrated here is their own view of the narrations in their books, not how <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars, who took the other course, understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> and <em>Uşūlī</em> Dispute</h2>



<p>Interestingly, this very same dispute about the categorization of narrations in itself shows that the Answering-Ansar team has not been truthful in relaying information about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar says:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The abovementioned quotes are sufficient in showing that this statement is an obvious lie. Nonetheless, let us quote a few more <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars as an elaboration of this issue so this lie of Answering-Ansar becomes much more clear to the readers.</p>



<p>Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī writes under the heading <em>‘</em><em>The Authentication of the Narrations in the Four Books</em><em>’</em> in his <em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>:</p>



<p>يراد بالتصحيح هنا اعتداد جميع ما في الكتب الأربعة من أحاديث رويت عن أهل البيت عليهم السلام معتبرة ومقطوعا بصدورها عن الأئمة والمسألة هذه وقعت موقع الخلاف بين علمائنا وطال البحث فيها وطال معه النقاش حولها</p>



<p><strong>“What is meant by ‘authentication’ here is considering all the narrations that are related from the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> in the Four Books, to be reliable and certainly issued from the <em>Imāms</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The late introduction of categorizing narrations with four different terminologies in terms of their authenticity and inauthenticity, led the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars to continue following the course early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars adhered to before its invention.</p>



<p><em><u>Sh</u></em><em>ī`ī</em> scholar and researcher, al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Mūsawī al-Ghurayfī (d. 1412) explains this in his work approved by Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī, <em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadīth</em>:</p>



<p>وقد شجب الأخباريون تنويع الحديث وعدوه من البدع التي يحرم العمل بها وبسطوا البحث في إبطاله وإثبات صحة جميع أخبار كتبنا الأربعة بل جميع الأخبار التي نقلوها عن الكتب المعتبرة لأنها محفوفة بقرائن تفيد الوثوق بصدورها عن المعصوم عليه السلام</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have disapproved of the categorization of narrations, and counted it among innovations that are forbidden to be practiced! They elaborated the discussion in nullification of it and establishing the authenticity of all the reports in our Four Books, rather all the reports that were copied from authoritative books, for they are enclosed with evidences that assist the certainty of their issuance from the infallible (as).”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Ghurayfī, page 16-17 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up, the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> reject the categorization, considering it unorthodox, and believe that all the narrations in the Four Books are correct and authentic. And as they remain on the course of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who believed a narration can either be <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, their view of the authenticity of narrations is that they are all <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Murtađá Muţahharī (d. 1407) states about the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of scholars:</p>



<p>أنهم يزعمون أن جميع الأخبار الواردة في الكتب الأربعة وهي الكافي ومن لا يحضره الفقيه والتهذيب والاستبصار أخبار صحيحة ومعتبرة بل وقطعية الصدور</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>They claim that all the reports in the Four Books—which are <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>—are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and reliable, in fact, certainly issued (from the infallibles).”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Similarly, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) also writes in his magnum opus, <em>A`yān al-Shī`a</em>:</p>



<p>فزعم الأخباريون أن اخبار الكتب الأربعة كلها صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> claimed that all of the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>While the contemporary expert <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Bāqir al-Īrawānī even mentions this is as the actual reason behind their rejection of the categorization:</p>



<p>وسبب إنكار الأخباريين لهذا التقسيم أن جميع اخبار الكتب الأربعة صحيحة ويجب العمل بها بنظرهم</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The reason behind the rejection of this categorization of narrations by the<em> A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> is: According to their view, <u>all the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and it is necessary to practice upon them</u>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>This group of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that considers all the narrations in the Four Books to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, includes renowned figures who marked their names as major scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>ūn</em>] and jurisprudence [<em>fuqahā’</em>] among them. In fact, their works are viewed to be a part of the most authoritative texts by <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars even today. To name a few:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Muĥammad Amīn al-Astarābādī (d. 1036): The foremost opponent of the categorization of narrations and author of an epistle upholding the belief in the correctness of all the narrations in the Four Books, <em>al-Fawā’id al-Madaniyya</em>. He was a scholar of narrations and a jurist, and authored several texts such as commentaries on <em>al-Istibşār</em> and <em>al-Tahdhīb</em>, and epistles on jurisprudence.</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Khalīl ibn al-Ghāzī al-Qazwīnī (d. 1089): A scholar of narrations and jurisprudence, and author of several texts such as a commentary on al-Ţusī’s <em>al-`Udda</em> and the most famous and great commentary of <em>al-Kāfī</em> ever written in the Persian language, <em>al-Şāfī</em>. <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> biographers mention that he was staunchly against the categorization of narrations, and believed all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> are authenticated by the last <em>Imām</em> himself and it is obligatory to practice upon them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Sayyid Hāshim al-Baĥrānī (d. 1107): He was an expert scholar of narrations, a jurist and a commentator of the Holy Qur’ān.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104) and <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em></h2>



<p>One of these scholars, as mentioned earlier, is Muĥammad ibn al-Ĥasan al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Abbās al-Qummī (d. 1359), who was a renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and biographer, has written under the biography of al-Ĥurr:</p>



<p>محمد بن الحسن بن علي المشغري شيخ المحدثين وأفضل المتبحرين العالم الفقيه النبيه المحدث المتبحر الورع الثقة الجليل أبو المكارم والفضائل صاحب المصنفات المفيدة منها الوسائل الذي من على المسلمين بتأليف هذا الجامع الذي هو كالبحر لا يساجل</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Muĥammad ibn al-Ĥasan ibn `Alī al-Ma<u>shgh</u>arī, the master of the scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>īn</em>], the best of the foremost experts in religion, the knowledgeable, the renowned jurist [<em>faqīh</em>], the profound scholar of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u></em>], the pious, the trustworthy, the venerable, the father of noble traits and virtues, and author of several beneficial works; one of which is the <em>Wasā’il</em>, a work that he has compiled as a bestowment upon the Muslims, a compilation that is like the ocean that can not be contested.”</strong></p>

<p>This al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī is one of those <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> scholars who strictly opposed the categorization of narrations and believed in the authenticity of all the narrations found the Four Books of the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a Imāmiyya I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>. He has extensively argued in favour of this position of his in the same compilation mentioned by `Abbās al-Qummī as “the ocean that can not be contested,” <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>.</p>



<p>al-Īrawānī says:</p>



<p>وقد قام الحر العاملي في وسائله بتجميع القرائن على ذلك أي صحة جميع ما في الكتب الأربعة فكانت ٢٢ قرينة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>In his <em>Wasā’il</em>, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī has gathered the evidences indicating that—meaning, the authenticity of whatever is in the Four Books—and they are (a total of) twenty two evidences.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he did not just stop at simply viewing other works of narrations to be entirely correct, but he also believed that his own compiled work, <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, contained only authentic and correct narrations.</p>



<p>al-Ghurayfī writes while mentioning how the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have argued against the categorization:</p>



<p>استدل عليه الشيخ محمد بن الحسن الحر باثنين وعشرين وجها في الفائدة التاسعة التي عقدها لاثبات صحة أحاديث جميع الكتب التي جمع منها كتابه وسائل الشيعة وحكم بوجوب العمل بها أجمع</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><em><u>Sh</u></em></strong><strong><em>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> Muĥammad ibn al-Ĥasan al-Ĥurr deduced twenty two points, under the eighth useful lesson, for establishing the authenticity of the narrations found in all the books, that he collected in his book <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, and he (also) ruled the obligation of practicing upon all of them.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Uşūlīs</em> Who Counted the Four Books as Completely Authentic</h2>



<p>Additionally, there have also been notable scholars from the <em>Uşūlī</em> group who believed that all the narrations found in the Four Books, and particularly <em>al-Kāfī</em>, are authentic and correct.</p>



<p>This is why <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Bāqir al-Īrawānī is affected to state after mentioning the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> view on narrations:</p>



<p>ولعل هذا الرأي هو المعروف بين الاخباريين بل ولربما يظهر اختياره من بعض الاصوليين</p>



<p><strong>“This is perhaps the opinion which is known among the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em>, and it sometimes appears to be chosen by a few <em>Usūlīs</em> as well.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>Durūs Tamhīdiyya fī al-Qawā`id al-Rijāliyya</em>, of Muĥammad Bāqir al-Īrawānī, page 100 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>Among contemporaries, are the late Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr (d. 1419), after whom the Sadr City suburb of Baghdad is named, and the renowned scholar and propagandist, author of <em>al-Murāja`āt</em>, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid `Abd al-Ĥusayn al-Mūsawī (d. 1377).</p>



<p>`Abd al-Ĥusayn al-Mūsawī writes while representing the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> sect in his alleged dialogue with one of the Grand <em>Imāms</em> of al-Azhar, Salīm al-Bishrī (d. 1335):</p>



<p>نبغ من أصحاب الصادق جم غفير وعدد كثير كانوا أئمة هدى ومصابيح دجى وبحار علم ونجوم هداية والذين دونت أسماؤهم وأحوالهم في كتب التراجم منهم أربعة آلاف رجل من العراق والحجاز وفارس وسوريا وهم أولو مصنفات مشهورة لدى علماء الإمامية ومن جملتها الأصول الأربعة مئة وهي كما ذكرناه سابقا أربع مئة مصنف لأربع مئة مصنف كتبت من فتاوى الصادق عليه السلام على عهده فكان عليها مدار العلم والعمل من بعده حتى لخصها جماعة من أعلام الأمة وسفراء الأئمة في كتب خاصة تسهيلا للطالب وتقريبا على المتناول وأحسن ما جمع منها الكتب الأربعة التي هي مرجع الإمامية في أصولهم وفروعهم من الصدر الأول إلى هذا الزمان وهي الكافي والتهذيب والاستبصار ومن لا يحضره الفقيه وهي متواترة ومضامينها مقطوع بصحتها والكافي أقدمها وأعظمها وأحسنها وأتقنها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>A great portion and large number from the companions of al-Şādiq (as) achieved ultimate wisdom. They became leaders [<em>imāms</em>] of right path, lanterns in darkness, oceans of knowledge, and stars of guidance. Among those, who have their names and conditions recorded in biographical texts, are four thousand men from Iraq, the Ĥijāz, Persia, and Syria. They are authors of famous works, which include the four hundred <em>Uşūls</em> of the <em>Imāmīs</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These (<em>Uşūls</em>)—as we mentioned earlier—are four hundred compilations authored by four hundred authors, which were written during the time of al-Şādiq (as) and contained his verdicts. They were the axis of knowledge and practice after him, to such an extent that a group of eminent scholars of this nation and ambassadors of the <em>Imāms</em> rendered them into books as a facilitation and summarization for the seeker and deriver of knowledge.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The best of what was compiled from the (<em>Uşūls</em>) are the Four Books, which are sources for the <em>Imāmīs</em> in referring to their roots and branches of religion, from their earliest period to this era.&nbsp; These are: <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>al-Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em>, <em>al-Istibşār</em> and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>. They are transmitted consecutively and their <u>contents are undoubtedly authentic</u>, and <em>al-Kāfī</em> is the oldest, the greatest, the best and the most accurate among them.</strong></p>

<li><em>al-Murāja`āt</em>, of `Abd al-Ĥusayn al-Mūsawī (d. 1377), page 419 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>On the other hand, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr even went to the extent of explicitly stating in his book entitled <em>al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p>أن الشيعة وإن كانت مجمعة على اعتبار الكتب الأربعة وقائلة بصحة كل ما فيها من روايات غير أنها لا تطلق عليها اسم الصحاح كما فعل ذلك إخوانهم أهل السنة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, even though they are unanimous upon the reliability of the Four Books and believe in the authenticity of all the narrations in them, do not name them<em> ‘</em><em>Şiĥāĥ</em><em>’</em> as their <em>Ahl al-Sunna</em> brothers did.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr (d. 1419), page 127 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>And last but not least, a scholar before these two individuals who also held that all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> are correct, was one of the renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> jurisprudents of his time, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Mīrzā Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī (d. 1355). His belief in the correctness of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> reached such a degree that he declared checking their chains of transmission to be a waste of time.</p>



<p>His student, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī (d. 1412) writes:</p>



<p>وقد ذكر غير واحد من الاعلام أن روايات الكافي كلها صحيحة ولا مجال لرمي شئ منها بضعف سندها وسمعت شيخنا الأستاذ الشيخ محمد حسين النائيني قدس سره في مجلس بحثه يقول إن المناقشة في إسناد روايات الكافي حرفة العاجز</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>More than one of the eminent scholars have mentioned that all the narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> are <em>şaĥīĥ</em></u></strong><strong>, and there is no room for putting away anything from it due to its weak chain of transmission. I heard our master and teacher <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī—may Allāh sanctify his secret—say in one of his gatherings of discussion: ‘Verily, arguing about the chains of transmission of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> is the vocation of an incompetent!’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It becomes crystal clear from all the quotes cited above that a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars consider all the narrations in the Four Books authentic and <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. Specially the narrations found in the most authoritative of the four, <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to deceptively say:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Qummī (d. 307) and his <em>Tafsīr</em></h2>



<p>A celebrated <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of this era, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid `Alī al-Shahrastānī, reveals in his book studying the recording of narrations:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>`Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummiy, the compiler of the famous book of Tafsir that carries his name, <u>has confirmed the authenticity of the Hadiths that he recorded in his book</u> by bearing out that these Hadiths have been reported by trustworthy narrators from the Holy Imams.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li><em>The Prohibition of Recording the Hadith: Causes and Effects (English)</em>, of Sayyid Ali al-Shahristaniy, page 510 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is evident, `Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī, who was a major scholar and teacher of al-Kulaynī, also confirmed that the narrations in his Commentary of the Holy Qur’ān are authentic. This, consequently, means that he himself also believed that the narrations in his work are authentic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ĥillī (d. 726), al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī (d. 1011) and Compilation of Authentic Narrations</h2>



<p>Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī, a major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar who is recognized as a reformer of his era among them, even compiled works of narrations in which he collected only authentic narrations. One in which he collected only rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] and fairly authentic [<em>ĥasan</em>] narrations, and another in which he collected only <em>şaĥīĥ</em> narrations.</p>



<p>According to his own work <em><u>Kh</u>ulāsat al-Aqwāl</em>, he named these two compilations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Durr wa al-Marjān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Pearls and Corals: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em> [“The Articulate Method: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ul>



<p>These compilations of narrations are unanimously counted as al-Ĥillī’s books and as it is obvious from the titles, al-Ĥillī believed all the narrations in it are sound and acceptable.</p>



<p>The compilations of al-Ĥillī influenced another famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar, al-Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-`Āmilī, and lead him to also author a compilation of narrations from the Four Books that were authentic and acceptable. He titled this work <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Selected Pearls: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389) writes about this when discussing the first work of al-Ĥillī in his biographical lexicon of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts, <em>al-<u>Dh</u>arī`a</em>:</p>



<p>وقد اقتفى اثره سميه الشيخ حسن بن زين الدين الشهيد صاحب المعالم المتوفى ١٠١١ وصنف كتابه منتقى الجمان في الأحاديث الصحاح والحسان وسيأتي في النون كتاب آخر للعلامة الحلي في هذا الموضوع اسمه النهج الوضاح في الأحاديث الصحاح</p>



<p><strong>“The namesake <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-<u>Sh</u>ahīd (d. 1011), the author of al-Ma`ālim, </strong><strong>has followed his [i.e. al-Ĥillī’s] track and authored his book <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī</em> <em>al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Soon, another book of al-`Allāma al-Ĥillī on this subject will be mentioned under the letter <em>‘</em><em>nūn</em>.<em>’</em> Its title is: <em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>This work is retained by contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, unlike the two works of al-Ĥillī, and used by them as an authoritative work of reference.</p>



<p>Furthermore, not only did Ĥasan claim that the narrations in his compilation are authentic and acceptable; he also believed that the entire contents of the Four Books are authentic.</p>



<p>al-Shahrastānī states:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Shaykh Hasan, in his books entitled Muntaqa al-Juman and al-Ma`alim, has stated that the Hadiths mentioned in the four most reliable Shi`ite reference books of Hadith (<em>al-Kutub al-Arba`ah</em>) and their likes are substantiated by proofs as they were, without any distortion, quoted from the al-Usul as well as the fundamental books the authenticity of which have been unanimously confirmed by the scholars.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kaf`amī (d. 905) and <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em></h2>



<p>Texts on narrations and commentaries aside, even compilations of supplications have been confirmed to be entirely authentic by some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars. Taqī al-Dīn al-Kaf`amī, a well-known and respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar, has compiled a book of narrated supplications that is famously known as <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ja`far Murtađá al-`Āmilī writes about it while citing it as a proof for his arguments:</p>



<p>ما ذكره الشيخ الكفعمي المتوفي سنة ٩٠٥ ه&#x200d; ق في كتابه المصباح الذي جمعه من حوالي مئتين وأربعين كتابا وقال إنه جمعه من كتب معتمد على صحتها مأمور بالتمسك بوثقى عروتها ولا يغيرها كر العصرين ولا مر الملوين كتب كمثل الشمس يكتب ضوؤها ومحلها فوق الرفيع الأرفع</p>



<p><strong>“10: W</strong><strong>hat is mentioned by <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> al-Kaf`ami (d. 905) in his book titled <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em> which he compiled from about two hundred and forty books. He said that he compiled it ‘from books the authenticity of which is reliable and upholding them mandated, and this cannot be altered by the evil efforts of time or by the endeavour of those with twisted minds. Books, like the sun, whose light—is written above the most high of the height.’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Ibn Bābawayh, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and other scholars’ claim that all the narrations compiled in their works are correct and <em>şaĥīĥ</em> is already showed above. But to cap it all off, let us share one last work of a recognized <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who “claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.”</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī has compiled an entire work entitled <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. al-Bahbūdī has claimed to have collected <strong>only</strong> rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> in this compilation, and accordingly, he has named it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.”</p>



<p>To begin with, it should be known that al-Bahbūdī is not a typical graduate of some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> institution, rather he is a reputed and praised scholar of today.</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Shihāb al-Dīn al-Mar`ashī (d. 1411) attributes the following words to al-Bahbūdī in his introduction to a work revised and edited by the latter, <em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm</em> of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877):</p>



<p>وقام العالم الفاضل الموفق لإحياء الزبر الدينية الاقا محمد باقر البهبودي شكر الله مساعيه ووفر معاليه بتصحيحه وتنقيحه بالمراجعة إلى النسخ العديدة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The brilliant scholar, who was victorious in reviving the religious scriptures, Master Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī—may Allāh appreciate his efforts and increase his loftiness—came forth with its correction and critical revision by referring to several manuscripts.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm ilá Mustaĥiqqī al-Taqdīm</em>, of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877), volume 1, page 4 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This al-Bahbūdī is the one mentioned by the <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428) in the following words:</p>



<p>وقد ألف أحد الباحثين في عصرنا صحيح الكافي اعتبر من مجموع ١٦١٢١ حديثا من أحاديث الكافي ٣٣٢٨ حديثا صحيحا وترك ١١٦٩٣ حديثا منها لم يراها حسب اجتهاده صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>One of the researchers of our time has compiled <em>‘</em><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>.<em>’</em> He counted 3328 narrations from the 16121 narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> as <em>şāĥīĥ</em>, and left 11693 narrations that he did not view to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to his judgement.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma`ālim al-Madrasatayn</em>, of al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428), volume 3, page 282 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The existence of this compilation not only exposes Answering-Ansar’s lie, but also shows the dubiousness of the argument reiterated by the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> propagandists of today:</p>



<p><strong>“According to us, only the Qur’ān is <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. We do not call any book <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> other than the Qur’ān as the <em>Sunnīs</em> do with <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>.”</strong></p>



<p>Any unbiased individual can see that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em> is not very different from <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em>. The authors both compiled their respected works with the intention of solely collecting narrations that were rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] according to them. The only difference is that what <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars are trying to do today, was done centuries ago by <em>Sunnīs</em>.</p>



<p>Neither do <em>Sunnīs</em> believe that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em> is <em>şaĥīĥ</em> as the Qur’ān is, nor do they intent to raise the rank of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em> as high as the Qur’ān. Rather, what they mean by calling it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>” is exactly what al-Bahbūdī meant when calling his compilation “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.” So if the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> are unable to unanimously agree upon a certain criterion of judging narrations, are the <em>Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jamā`a</em> to be accused of elevating a book to the position of the Holy Qur’ān for simply agreeing upon the authenticity of the narrations in a book called “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>”?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion – Facts that Prove the Lies of Answering-Ansar</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the abovementioned study of both early and contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts reveals the following facts about their scholars:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī believed and confirmed that all the narrations in his compilation are correct.</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī believed and confirmed that all the narrations in his compilation are correct.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī confirmed in his works such as <em>al-`Udda</em>, as mentioned by al-Baĥrānī, that all the narrations in his two compilations are authentic and acceptable.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many prominent and eminent <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars claim that all the narrations in the Four Books, and particularly <em>al-Kāfī</em>, are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī, a scholar of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u></em>] and jurist [<em>faqīh</em>], claimed that all of the narrations compiled in his book are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and thus it is obligatory to practice upon them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>`Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī confirmed the authenticity of all the narrations in his <em>Tafsīr</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī compiled two works in which he claimed to have collected only authentic narrations. One containing only <em>şaĥīĥ</em> narrations and another containing both <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>ĥasan</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī, the author of al-Ma`ālim, followed al-Ĥillī and also compiled a work in which he collected only authentic and acceptable narrations.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Taqī al-Dīn al-Kaf`amī testified to the authenticity of the entire contents of his book.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī claimed that all the narrations in his book <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em> are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>In light of the facts above, we have the following statement of the Answering-Ansar team:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih. Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Now, it is up to the readers to decide whether what Answering-Ansar has said is a lie or not.</p>



<p>Readers should also know that this lengthy discussion could have been successfully dealt by proving the mere existence of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. After all, al-Bahbūdī is a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who compiled a book declaring that all the narrations in it are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, while Answering-Ansar blatantly lies by saying “no one among the Shia ulema” did such a thing.</p>



<p>However, several <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts have been cited for readers to realize that this not a simple a matter related to a single text, rather a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been believing and declaring the authenticity of all the narrations in particular texts, to the extent that a group of major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars even denied the late categorization of narrations to uphold their belief that all the narrations in the “Four Books” are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>Thus, it was not just shown that Answering-Ansar has simply lied because there are contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars who have testified to the authenticity of the narrations in their books, but that the Answering-Ansar team is deceptively trying to keep people in the dark about how many <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been viewing their texts throughout history, by lying.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Few Points to Note</h2>



<p>Lastly, a few points about the quote of the Answering-Ansar team should also be noted here:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They have mentioned a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar by the name of:<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>محمد جواد معتية</p>



<p>“Muhammad Jawwad <strong>Ma`tiya</strong>.”</p>



<p>Poor plagiarism. The late scholar’s actual name is:</p>



<p>محمد جواد مغنية</p>



<p>Muĥammad Jawād <strong>Mu<u>gh</u>niyya</strong>.</p>



<p>Had the Answering-Ansar team known the scholar they are copying information about, they would not have confused the diacritical points and made this ignorant mistake.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One of the categories of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> narrations is mentioned as “Mawthiq,” whereas the actual word is “<em>muwa<u>thth</u>aq</em>” [authenticated]. <em>Mawthiq</em> refers to a covenant or a contract, not to mention that it is morphologically incorrect to use it for a narration. This clearly shows how much knowledge of the Arabic language and their own narrations is possessed by the pinnacles behind Answering-Ansar.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our advice to the Answering-Ansar team is that they should pick up a few Arabic text books for beginners before they discuss the sensitive issue of distortion of the Holy Qur’ān, a book of eloquent Arabic.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Al-Mufaddal, Muhammad b. ‘Abdillah Al-Shaybani (d. 387), was an infamous Shi’ite forger from the city of Baghdad who was criticized and condemned by Sunni and Shi’ite scholarship alike. Though this transmitter’s reliability and trustworthiness are disparaged in both traditions, Shi’ite scholarship seems to have bypassed that criticism, since it has relied on him in the transmission of key biographical data, most importantly: the books of earlier transmitters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What They Said About Him</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As stated earlier, both Sunni and Shi’ite scholarship alike have condemned the liar known as Abu Al-Mufaddal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><u>Sunni Scholarship</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Hajar compiled most of the criticism Abu Al-Mufaddal had received in Sunni sources under his biographical entry in <em>Lisan Al-Mizan</em> 7/253:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Daraqutni accused him of fabrication, and Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi described him saying: “They initially transcribed hadiths from him selected by Al-Daraqutni; however, his deceit eventually became apparent to them, so they ripped his hadith apart. He used to fabricate hadiths for the <em>Rafidah</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamzah b. Muhammad said: “He used to fabricate hadiths, and I had transcribed hadith from him.” Al-Azhari said: “He used to memorize hadiths,” and then said: “He was a lying <em>Dajjal</em>; I never saw an <em>‘asl </em>for him.” Al-‘Atiqi said: “He was of great distortion (<em>takhlit</em>).” Abu Dharr Al-Harawi said: “He sat to the <em>Rafidah </em>and transmitted to them hadiths where he mentioned the blunders of the Sahabah, and they [the critics] used to accuse him of distortion and fabrication.” (Ibn Hajar 253)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn ‘Araq described him saying: “A <em>Dajjal</em> who fabricated hadiths.” (Ibn ‘Araq 1/107)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><u>Shi’ite Scholarship</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khoei compiled the criticism Abu Al-Mufaddal had received in Shi’ite sources under his biographical entry in <em>Mo’jam Rijal Al-Hadith</em> 17/260:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Najashi described him saying: “He was, at first, a reliable transmitter; however, he later mixed up. I saw that most of our companions criticized and censured him.” Al-Najashi then proceeded to list his books, and then he said: “I have seen this sheikh, and I heard a lot from him; however, I eventually stopped transmitting directly from him unless there was an intermediary between me and him.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi described him saying: “He was a prolific transmitter, and of good memory; however, a group of our companions had weakened him.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Al-Ghada’iri said: “He was a forger who transmitted many disapproved reports (<em>manakir</em>). I have seen his books, and they contain <em>isnads</em> without the texts, and texts without the <em>isnads</em>. I see that anything he exclusively transmits must be abandoned.” (Al-Khoei 17:260)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident, the extreme criticism Abu Al-Mufaddal received in both Sunni and Shi’ite sources clearly is demonstrative of the fact that he cannot be relied upon when transmitting anything of historical or religious significance. Shi’ite scholarship, however, seems to have bypassed this criticism by actually relying upon this man’s transmission on many instances. 19<sup>th</sup> century Shi’ite scholar of hadith, Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi, makes note of this reality, and describes Abu Al-Mufaddal saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was from the great <em>shuyukh</em> of <em>ijazah</em>, even though they weakened him. I have observed that their practice is contrary to [their criticism of him]” (Al-Shahrudi 7/188)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I initially made note of this phenomenon as I went through Mo’jam Rijal Al-Hadith, where I noticed that Al-Tusi’s chains of transmission regularly converged back to Abu Al-Mufaddal. Al-Tusi’s dependence on Abu Al-Mufaddal is mostly limited to the transmission of the books and works of earlier transmitters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a common practice that can be observed in Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi’s works on <em>rijal</em>. They will often list the transmitter’s name, mention any praise/criticism he has received, and then list their chains of transmission to any of his book(s).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reader may ask: “What are the implications of this phenomenon?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reality of the matter is that this issue may be of many grave implications. We now know that Al-Tusi depended on unreliably transmitted content ascribed to the transmitters of hadith while he assessed their reliability. Since Al-Tusi did not meet most of the transmitters listed in his books, Shi’ite polemicists argue that Al-Tusi must have relied upon later textual indicators to evaluate the reliability of earlier transmitters. However, if these later indicators are based on faulty and unreliable transmission of biographical data that cannot be authentically ascribed to the transmitters being evaluated, then Al-Tusi’s conclusions are simply unreliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we trust his verdicts on many transmitters when they are based on unreliably transmitted texts solely transmitted through liars, forgers, weak and anonymous transmitters?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Note: There is a great possibility that Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi’s evaluation of transmitters is absolutely arbitrary and not based on any objective standard, as <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2019/01/20/10-reasons-why-you-should-not-trust-shia-hadith-sources/">previously pointed out</a>. However, in this article, we entertain the claim made by Shi’ite polemicists when desperately attempting to defend Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi’s works.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Many Times is the forger, Abu Al-Mufaddal, cited?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a detailed analysis, we found that Abu Al-Mufaddal is cited in the chains of transmission of Al-Tusi <u>over 296 times </u>as he listed his isnads to the books of the transmitters he assessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the instances where he is cited in their isnads as listed in <em>Mo’jam Rijal Al-Hadith</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1/134, 1/180, 1/189, 1/226, 1/269, 2/134, 2/136, 2/157, 3/89, 4/56, 4/84, 4/102, 4/107, 4/108, 4/136, 4/145, 4/165, 5/11, 5/48, 5/84, 5/95, 5/155, 5/155, 5/159, 5/164, 5/205, 5/212, 5/213, 5/220, 5/225, 5/250, 5/306, 5/318, 5/360, 5/363, 6/25, 6/40, 6/41, 6/62, 6/64, 6/157, 6/187, 6/193, 6/206, 6/238, 6/293, 7/30, 7/74, 7/83, 7/97, 7/118, 7/123, 7/141, 7/146, 7/148, 7/170, 7/173, 7/280, 7/317, 8/12, 8/30, 8/62, 8/108, 8/124, 8/130, 8/133, 8/134, 8/178, 8/192, 8/192, 8/224, 8/279, 8/284, 8/289, 8/289, 8/312, 9/44, 9/57, 9/65, 9/73, 9/100, 9/111, 9/118, 9/134, 9/138, 9/163, 9/249, 9/277, 9/282, 9/331, 9/381, 10/23, 10/49, 10/60, 10/69, 10/70, 10/75, 10/93, 10/95, 10/105, 10/158, 10/179, 10/205, 10/234, 10/258, 10/260, 10/269, 10/285, 10/327, 10/339, 10/351, 10/371, 11/25, 11/41, 11/54, 11/60, 11/76, 11/115, 11/115, 11/132, 11/187, 11/209, 11/239, 11/273, 11/304, 11/393, 11/395, 11/400, 12/27, 12/35, 12/36, 12/44, 12/54, 12/111, 12/173, 12/192, 12/194, 12/234, 12/247, 12/296, 12/323, 12/342, 12/352, 12/377, 13/64, 13/69, 13/100, 13/118, 13/139, 13/230, 14/13, 14/23, 14/25, 14/35, 14/79, 14/84, 14/95, 14/101, 14/108, 14/117, 14/128, 14/146, 14/154, 14/162, 14/162, 14/184, 14/196, 14/206, 14/209, 14/292, 14/301, 14/329, 14/338, 14/351, 15/24, 15/47, 15/67, 15/77, 15/137, 15/177, 15/189, 15/189, 15/190, 15/203, 15/206, 15/245, 15/254, 15/283, 16/22, 16/56, 16/116, 16/135, 16/137, 16/144, 16/145, 16/238, 17/11, 17/41, 17/47, 17/59, 17/67, 17/74, 17/81, 17/92, 17/126, 17/138, 17/209, 17/211, 17/223, 17/266, 17/277, 17/302, 17/303, 17/319, 18/43, 18/54, 18/55, 18/59, 18/74, 18/83, 18/131, 18/150, 18/169, 18/179, 18/181, 18/191, 18/233, 18/242, 18/244, 18/292, 18/308, 18/312, 18/330, 18/345, 19/32, 19/37, 19/42, 19/122, 19/139, 19/184, 19/190, 19/225, 19/227, 19/240, 19/246, 19/281, 19/361, 19/379, 19/380, 19/384, 20/18, 20/23, 20/25, 20/49, 20/53, 20/131, 20/146, 20/218, 20/228, 20/247, 20/268, 20/348, 20/355, 21/10, 21/21, 21/23, 21/27, 21/74, 21/100, 21/108, 21/118, 21/128, 21/150, 21/151, 21/166, 21/174, 21/208, 21/243, 22/25, 22/78, 22/193, 22/194, 22/213, 22/214, 22/231, 22/232, 22/258, 22/261, 22/273, 22/282, 23/35, 23/40, 23/53, 23/81, 23/96, 23/100</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us evaluate the situation at hand: we have Abu Al-Mufaddal, a notorious forger from 4<sup>th</sup> century Baghdad who was condemned in both the Sunni and Shi’ite traditions, supposedly transmitting hundreds upon hundreds of books ascribed to earlier Shi’ite sources. Major Shi’ite <em>rijali </em>sources then bypass all the criticism and regularly rely upon Abu Al-Mufaddal’s transmission as they transmitted key biographical data exclusively through him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us take a look at an example under the biographical entry of Al-Hasan b. ‘Ali b. Al-No’man in <em>Mo’jam Rijal Al-Hadith</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Najashi said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Al-Hasan b. ‘Ali Al-No’man, the <em>mawla</em> of Bani Hashem. His father is ‘Ali b. Al-No’man Al-A’lam. He was a reliable <em>thabt. </em>He has a book called <em>Nawadir Al-Hadith</em>, that is Sahih and of great benefit. Ibn Nuh transmitted it to me, from Al-Bazufari, from Ahmed b. Idris, from Al-Saffar, from him [Al-Hasan].”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Al-Hasan b. ‘Ali Al-No’man, the <em>mawla</em> of Bani Hashem.He has a book called <em>Nawadir Al-Hadith</em>, that is of great benefit. A group of my companions have transmitted it to me from <u>Abu Al-Mufaddal</u>, from Ibn Buttah, from Ahmed b. Abi ‘Abdillah and Al-Saffar both from him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khoei then comments saying: “The sheikh’s [Al-Tusi’s]  isnad to him is weak, due to Abu Al-Mufaddal and Ibn Buttah.” (Al-Khoei 6:61-62)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Al-Khoei refrains from commenting on Al-Najashi’s isnad to Al-Hasan’s book, even though it is weak due to Al-Bazufari, Ahmed b. Ja’far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, in this example, we observe Al-Tusi making a value judgement on Al-Hasan’s book, even though his copy of that book is transmitted to him through the forger, Abu Al-Mufaddal, and the unknown transmitter, Ibn Buttah. How can Al-Tusi come to such a conclusion regarding the book ascribed to Al-Hasan b. ‘Ali when his copy was transmitted to him through a forger AND an anonymous transmitter?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Najashi makes a similar value judgement on the book even though his copy, too, is unreliably transmitted to him through the anonymous transmitter, Ahmed b. Ja’far Al-Bazufari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we know that the only form of tangible textual evidence pertaining to this transmitter Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi may have possessed is a text that is transmitted to them from unreliable sources. They have not listed any other potential textual indicators they may have evaluated to assess the reliability of the transmitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This phenomenon opens to the door to many questions, most importantly:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi relied upon untrustworthy and unreliable sources to document the biographical data of many transmitters, how can we assume that their assessments and verdicts pertaining to the reliability of transmitters are accurate and representative of reality?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why is a liar, like Abu Al-Mufaddal, such an extremely prolific transmitter and source of information in Shi’ite <em>rijali </em>sources?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Abu Al-Mufaddal was the sole narrator of other works in Fihrist Al-Tusi, including the works of Al-Hasan bin Musa Al-Kashshab, Al-Hasan bin Ali Al-Washsha’, Ali bin Hadeed, Ali bin Hasaan Al-Wasiti, Abdul-Rahman bin Abi Al-Najran,  Al-Ayyashi, Abu Ali bin Hammam, and Yunus bin Ya’qoub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Shi’ite polemicist attempts to have his cake and eat it by undermining the value and role of Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi’s transmission of the books of earlier transmitters, then he opens the door to another greater problem, which is the question of whether Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi actually relied upon tangible textual indicators when evaluating the reliability of earlier transmitters or whether their verdicts are totally arbitrary and not based on an objective textual analysis of the transmitter’s transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another noteworthy point is that Shi’ite polemicists regularly boast about how their tradition is based on (extinct) written collections from the earliest of Shi’ite transmitters. However, we have seen here that many of these claims are inaccurate, unverified and often incorrect since they are frequently made by transmitters who were weak, unknown or suspected of forgery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite scholarship’s reliance upon the forger, Abu Al-Mufaddal, in <em>rijali </em>biographical sources is merely an example of a much more significant problem. Many similarly weak and unknown transmitters are regularly cited in Shi’ite <em>rijali </em>sources as transmitters of the books and works of earlier transmitters. This spans transmitters such as: Musa b. Ja’far Al-Ha’iri, Ahmed b. Ja’far Al-Bazufari, Ibn Buttah Al-Qommi, Ahmed b. Muhammad b. Yahya Al-‘Attar and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This phenomenon should be enough of a reason for the honest Muslim to cast doubts on the reliability and authority of Shi’ite <em>rijali </em>sources. It is unfortunate to see an entire religion based on such faulty and historically defective sources; however, guidance, at the end of the day, is in the hands of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And Allah is the best of witnesses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After engaging in Sunni-Shia polemics for a while, one eventually recognizes that most of the disagreement ultimately stems from one main factor: the relative independence of Sunni and Shi’ite primary historical sources. These independent primary sources present conflicting alternative narratives about various pivotal Islamic events, teachings and figures, ultimately leading to the rise of two drastically opposed Islamic traditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though much is to be said in this context, one thing must be made clear: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ad hoc</em> dismissals of primary historical sources simply due to sectarian reasons is not an objective nor a sound approach to history.</span> This point applies to both Sunni and Shi’ite polemicists alike, who often dismiss each other’s sources simply due to the fact their authors come from an opposing school. Instead, a keen observer will recognize that both narratives cannot be valid at once and will thus search for various textual indicators to evaluate which tradition is historically superior to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are several reasons why we believe Sunni sources are historically superior to Shi’ite sources, and why Sunni sources are more authoritative primary sources when it comes to presenting and relaying the Prophet’s biography and teachings:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Sunni Sources Predate Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When evaluating primary historical sources, historians employ a rule known as the &#8220;Time and Place Rule”. This rule entails that historical sources that are closer in time and place to the event(s) they address are generally given precedence over later and more distant sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate historical description of what really happened.” (Faye 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reasoning behind this is self-evident: later sources and accounts suffer from an increased risk of corruption in their respective content. This corruption may simply be the result of unintended errors that occurred during the process of transmission, and it may be the result of malicious tampering with the reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunni sources, in this aspect, are superior to Shi’i sources, since they are all much closer in time to the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the earliest Sunni authors with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extant works</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ma’mar b. Rashed (d. 153)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Ishaq (d. 151)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Malek b. Anas (d. 179)</li>
<li>Isma&#8217;il b. Ja&#8217;far Al-Ansari (d. 180)</li>
<li>&#8216;Abdullah b. Al-Mubarak (d. 181)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">‘Abdurrazzaq Al-San’ani (d. 211)</li>
<li>&#8216;Abdullah b. Al-Zubayr Al-Humaydi (d. 219)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sa’id b. Mansur (d. 227)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ali b. Al-Ja’d (d. 230)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Sa’d (d. 230)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaybah (d. 235)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The earliest Shi’i authors with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extant works</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ahmad b. Muhammad Al-Barqi (d. 274)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Al-Hassan Al-Saffar (d. 290)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Ya&#8217;qub Al-Kulayni (d. 329)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Ali, Ibn Babawayh Al-Qommi (d. 381)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muhammad b. Al-Hasan Al-Tusi (d. 460)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident, Shi’i sources tend to come much later than most Sunni sources. In fact, the earliest extant Sunni source, the Jami’ of Ma’mar, precedes the earliest major Shi’i collection by around 100 years. The time gap between the latest Sunni source listed and the latest Shi’i source listed is over 200 years!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later Sunni hadith collections, such as the Musnad of Ahmed (d. 241), Musnad of Al-Darimi (d. 255), Sahih of Al-Bukhari (d. 256), Sahih of Muslim (d. 261), and Al-Sunan by Abu Dawud (d. 275) predate most of the earlier Shi’i collections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some Shi’ite polemicists attempt to appeal to some supposedly earlier Shi’ite hadith collections, known as the 400 Usul; however, there is no way to verify the veracity of these claims since most of these supposed sources are extinct. Similarly, the very few Usul that have survived till this day suffer from a <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/11/28/the-400-usool-in-shia-hadith/">variety of defects</a>, which severely undermine and diminish their historical value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: The first two Shi’ite authors mentioned authored relatively small works that mostly consist of traditions from the Imams related to their virtues and their opinions. They do not contain much from the Prophet nor do they really present anything from the Prophet’s biography. Thus, they are somewhat irrelevant. However, we decided to list them here for the sake of fairness. Otherwise, the list should actually start with Muhammad b. Ya&#8217;qub Al-Kulayni (d. 329), author of Al-Kafi.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. The Circular Reasoning Behind the Appeal to Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite apologists and polemicists often justify their primary sources by stating that they simply are obeying the supposed prophetic command to follow Ahlulbait. This appeal, however, is based on circular reasoning. This is because the “command to exclusively follow Ahlulbait” is a conclusion that is reached through Shi’ite primary sources themselves! Shi’ite polemicists end up citing this very same conclusion as a premise to their appeal to their sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their argument, when outlined in the form of a syllogism, is as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="text-align: justify;">We are commanded to exclusively take our religion from Ahlulbait as per Shi’ite sources</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite sources are based on transmission from Ahlulbait</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, Shi’ite sources are superior and more reliable sources on Islam</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The circular reasoning stems from the first premise, as it embodies the very same conclusion the polemicist is attempting to establish. The first premise, “We are commanded to exclusively take our religion from Ahlulbait,” is a conclusion that is reached through Shi’ite sources. Thus, the polemicist is already assuming the validity of Shi’ite sources, from which he derives this premise. As seen, the entire argument is based on its very same conclusion, which is evidently problematic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When faced with this reality, Shi’ite polemicists often attempt to appeal to reports in Sunni sources that supposedly support the first premise. These appeals are problematic for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They are usually based on extremely weak reports in Sunni sources. (e.g <a href="http://ghadirkhumm.com/thaqalayn-critical-study/" rel="external nofollow">Hadith Al-Thaqalayn</a>)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These vague (and often weak) reports on the virtues of Ahlulbait do not substantiate the validity of Shi’ite primary sources, since Sunni sources also contain a vast array of reports from Ahlulbait. The claim that Shi’ite collections are the only historical sources that transmit from Ahlulbait is a flat-out lie.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These appeals are based on a selective reading of Sunni texts, since a multitude of authentic reports in the Sunni corpus negate various elements of Shi’ite theology. Thus, Shi’ite polemicists will selectively read and cite Sunni sources while disregarding a plethora of other relevant reports.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. The False Dichotomy of “Ahlulbait vs. Sahabah”</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When appealing to their primary sources, Shi’ite polemicists and scholars often appeal to the false dichotomy of &#8220;the Prophet’s Family vs. the Prophet’s Companions.” In this fallacious appeal, the disagreement between Sunnis and Shias is simply reduced to the supposed notion that Sunnis chose the Sahabah as the transmitters of the Prophet’s legacy while the Shia chose Ahlulbait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the fact that this notion is blatantly false, this dichotomy has no historical basis. The reality of the matter is that the companions of the Prophet ALONG with his family were key eye-witnesses to various events in the Prophet’s life, hence why the Sunni tradition does not draw this distinction in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunni sources draw their material from all major eyewitnesses during the Prophet’s life, whether they be from his wives, relatives, neighbors, congregants, friends, and companions.<br />
Here is an example of this false dichotomy being employed by Shi’ite polemicist and apologist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7rr_krAdEY" rel="external nofollow">Ammar Nakshawani</a>:<br />
<em>Timestamp: 6:01 – 6:28.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This faulty approach to history leads to a new problem that faces Shi’ite sources&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. The Lack of Eyewitness Testimonies in Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eyewitness accounts are crucial when evaluating and studying the lives and teachings of historical figures. Historians, in fact, give precedence to eye-witness accounts over second-hand testimonies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“An eyewitness is more reliable than testimony at second hand, which is more reliable than hearsay at further remove, and so on.” (Thurén)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Shi’ite scholarship dismisses the reliability of the Sahabah as transmitters of hadith (and thus, most eyewitness testimonies pertaining to the Prophet’s life), the Shi’ite tradition is primarily based on the sayings of the Imams. Out of the Twelve Imams, only three could be considered eye-witnesses to certain events from the Seerah; however, those three imams are rarely quoted in Shi’ite collections when compared to other imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather, most Shi’ite traditions are ascribed to the 6th Shi’ite Imam, Ja’far Al-Sadeq (d. 148) and then the 5th Imam, Muhammad Al-Baqir (d. 118). These traditions mostly span their legal opinions, theological positions, behaviors, promises of reward/punishment and virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To a historian, this is a problem. Ja’far Al-Sadeq was but a later historical figure that lived around a hundred years after the Prophet’s death. His opinions and sayings are definitely not equal in weight to those of primary eye-witnesses who saw and experienced many of the major events from the Prophet’s life. This problem directly leads to another problem that faces Shi’ite sources&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. The Shi’ite Tradition’s Inability to Present a Thorough Narrative on the Prophet’s Life</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Shi’ite scholarship dismisses most eyewitness accounts pertaining to the Prophet’s life, Shi’ite sources simply are incapable of presenting a thorough and comprehensive narrative pertaining to the Prophet’s life. This is because Shi’ite sources are limited to only a handful of eyewitnesses, most importantly, the first three Imams. These three Imams, however, did not witness many of the key events alongside the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first imam, Ali b. Abi Taleb, was but a 9-year old child when the Prophet began preaching Islam in Mecca. The second and third imams, Al-Hasan and Al-Husain, were only born in Medina after the Prophet’s immigration from Mecca, and they were both less than ten years-old when the Prophet died. Evidently, the first three imams of the Shia did not witness many of the major events in the Meccan period of Islam prior to the Prophet’s immigration from Mecca. Similarly, they did not witness ALL prophetic events from the Medinite period of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This reality manifests in the lack of classical Shi’ite works on the Prophet’s biography, which are based on eye-witness accounts. Rather, contemporary Shi’ite works on the Seerah are primarily based on Sunni and other non-Shi’ite classical sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This reality also manifests in a <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/06/02/prophetic-narrations-numbers-and-authenticity/">study</a> published by our friend, Hani Al-Tarabulsi, where he comprehensively went through Al-Kafi in search of Prophetic traditions. He concluded that only 14.86% of the book consists of Prophetic traditions. However, only around a third of those reports actually were authentic according to Shi’ite standards. Thus, only around 4.75% of Al-Kafi consists of reliable Prophetic traditions according to the Shia. This relatively minute number of Prophetic traditions is but an example of Twelver sources’ lack of material pertaining to the Prophet and his biography.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">6. The Lack of a Transparently Objective Methodology Behind the Evaluation of Transmitters in Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When evaluating the reliability of transmitters in Twelver literature, Twelver scholarship primarily relies on the endorsements and verdicts of Al-Tusi (d. 460) and Al-Najashi (d. 450). Other authorities are occasionally relied upon in this context, such as Al-Mufid (d. 413) , ‘Ali b. Ibrahim Al-Qummi (d. 329), and Al-Kashi (d.350) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Little (if any) is known about the methodology behind their verdicts on the reliability of transmitters. These authors have not published works where they explain their methodologies behind their verdicts, nor do they ever provide their reasoning behind their individual conclusions. Thus, we cannot deem their conclusions reliable. In fact, we do not even know if the Shi’ite rijalists espoused a methodology in the first place due to the relative obscurity of their works. The implication of this issue is that the authentication of reports in Twelver sources may be totally arbitrary, and that the Shi’ite scholarship cannot objectively discern the authentic from the inauthentic in their sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni muhaddithin, on the other hand, have done a great job in transparently outlining their methodology when evaluating the reliability of transmitters. On page 8 of “<a href="http://www.islamicdiscourseinitiative.com/canon/hadith/in-defense-of-the-hadith-methodebook/" rel="external nofollow">In Defense of the Hadith Method</a>”, our great friend, Abdullah Moataz presents a great example of a few of the transparently objective methods employed by the Sunni muhaddithin when evaluating the reliability of transmitters. This lack of a transparently objective methodology in Shi’ite sources manifests as another problem&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">7. The Inability to Dispel Bias from the Process of Authentication in Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the lack of a transparently objective methodology in Shi’ite biographical sources, it is not a surprise that the entire methodology may, in fact, be based on arbitrary theological biases upheld by Shi’ite authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite Scholar of Hadith, Sayed Hossein Qazwini in his book, <em>Durus fi ‘Ilm Al-Rijal</em>, states that Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi often endorsed transmitters on a purely theological basis. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They (Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi) would most often transmit the reports of a transmitter and then evaluate them based on their contents. If their contents were aligned with their theological positions, they (Al-Tusi &amp; Al-Najashi) would not weaken the transmitter. Otherwise, they would accuse him of weakness, deceit and<em> ghuluww</em>. (Qazwini 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a catastrophe: the implications of Sayyed Hossein’s words are that Shi’ite authorities often weakened and dismissed transmitters simply because they transmitted reports that were not in-line with Shi’ite theology! However, the fact that a transmitter may have transmitted “non-Twelver” hadiths, has no actual implications on his honesty or reliability as a transmitter of historical reports. It has no actual implications on his memory or his retention. How can such a defective, openly biased and non-objective methodology be used to come to impartial historical conclusions?!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">8. The Significant Time-Gap Between Shi’ite Rijalists and Most Transmitters in Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two main Shi’ite authorities on <em>Rijal</em>, Al-Tusi (d. 460) and Al-Najashi (d. 450), did not witness or encounter most of the transmitters they endorsed/condemned. The gap between them and the transmitters they often mentioned was often more than two centuries long. Shi’ite muhaddith, Grand Ayatollah Al-Khoei, thus held the position that Al-Tusi and Najashi did not issue verdicts based on their own judgement. Rather, he believed that they simply transmitted the endorsements/condemnations from earlier sources that actually witnessed these transmitters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This appeal opens the door to a whole new problem: Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi did not list these hypothetical sources that relayed to them these verdicts on the reliability of transmitters. The historian is thus incapable of verifying the authenticity of these claims and verdicts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite scholar of hadith, Asif Mohseni, presents this dilemma in his book, <em>Buhuth fi ‘Ilm Al-Rijal</em>. In it, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is that their endorsements and condemnations of a transmitter, along with anything else they mention about the transmitters, come with a gap in time. However, they do not list the transmitters between them [till that period] for us to analyze whether they were reliable, weak or unknown transmitters. Accepting such time-lapsed approvals of transmitters is unjustified unless we are to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they [Najashi and Tusi] only transmitted from reliable transmitters without listing them. In that case, how can we accept their statements? Why don’t we ask about whom they transmitted [these endorsements] from? (Mohseni 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When describing this problem, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If anyone were to find me a solution to this dilemma, I would offer him a sum of money and I would be very thankful, for this dilemma makes <em>ilmur-Rijaal</em> an unreliable discipline from a logical and religious standpoint. (Mohseni 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As clearly stated by Mohseni, this dilemma fundamentally undermines the core of Shi’ite Ilm Al-Rijaal. If no evidence is provided to show that Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi had relied on authentic chains that go all the way back to the transmitters in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries when issuing their verdicts, then most (if not all) of their opinions on transmitters from these periods are quite unreliable. The entire process of authentication in Twelver hadith sources is potentially jeopardized as a result of this dilemma.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">9. The Arbitrary Endorsement of Forgers and Weak Transmitters in Shi’ite Sources</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Points #6-8 ultimately manifest in this interesting phenomenon. With such a defective approach to <em>‘Ilm Al-Rijal</em> espoused by the Shia, it is not a surprise that Shi’ite biographical sources ended up endorsing a variety of forgers, liars and weak transmitters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few examples (out of 80 other examples I had found), where Shi’ite authorities declared known forgers, liars and weak transmitters to be reliable. Many of these transmitters are openly declared to be <em>‘Ammi</em> (Sunni) by Shi’ite authorities; thus, it cannot be said that Sunni sources simply weakened them due to a supposed sectarian bias.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I shall list the name of the transmitter in question, and I shall then list the verdicts of the Sunni critics followed by the verdicts of the Shi’ite critics:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Asram b. Hawshab</h3>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shia Authorities:</span></p>

</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Isma’il b. Abi Ziyad Al-Sukuni</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunni Authorities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Daraqutni (d. 385) said: “He is abandoned (<em>matruk</em>) in hadith.” (Ibn Hajar 1/406)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Khalili said (d. 446): “He is a weak sheikh who is not well-known.” (Ibn Hajar 1/406)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shi’ite Authorities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi (d. 460) said: “The sect has acted upon the reports transmitted by Hafs b. Ghiyath, Nuh b. Darraj, Ghiyath b. Kalub, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Al-Sukuni.</span>” (Al-Tusi 1/149)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Jawaheri said: “He was from the transmitters of the <em>‘Ammah</em> (Ahlussunnah). He transmitted 61 reports, all from Abu ‘Abdillah, asides from one instance. He was reliable (<em>thiqah</em>).” (Al-Jawaheri 63)</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Al-Harith b. ‘Imran Al-Ja’fari</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunni Authorities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Abu Zur’ah Al-Razi (d.) said: “He is weak in hadith, extremely weak (<em>wahi</em>)” (Ibn Abi Hatem 3/79)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Abu Hatem Al-Razi (d. 277) said: “He is weak in hadith.” (Ibn Abi Hatem 3/79)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Hibban (d. 354) said: “He used to fabricate hadiths and ascribe them to reliable transmitters.” (Ibn Hibban 1/225)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Daraqutni said: “He is an abandoned Kufan.” (Al-Burqani 24)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite Authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Najashi said: “He is a reliable Kufan. He transmitted from Ja’far b. Muhammad [Al-Sadeq]” (Al-Khoei 5/176)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In these few examples, we get a glimpse of the dire state of Shi’te biographical sources. Many similar forgers and weak transmitters were declared to be reliable by Shi’ite authorities. The reader, however, may ask: How do we know that the Sunni critics’ verdicts are more accurate and reliable than the Shi’ite verdicts?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to that question lies in several points:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni critics’ verdicts predate the Shi’ite verdicts, which means that the Sunni critics had greater proximity and access to these transmitters than the later Shi’ite authorities. This reality can be demonstrated in the first example given: Al-Jawzajani stated that he met Asram b. Hawshab and transcribed hadiths from him, yet he concluded that he was weak. Al-Najashi, the Shi’ite, who came two centuries later, never met him, however, randomly declared him to be reliable. (The year of death of each critic was added to his name to specifically demonstrate this point.)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni critics’ verdicts are corroborated. As seen, multiple independent Sunni authorities are often in agreement regarding the status of the transmitter reinforcing that opinion, while Shi’ite sources are often limited to the individual endorsements of Al-Tusi and/or Al-Najashi. When a Sunni authority errs in his judgement, we can identify that mistake due to the abundance of other verdicts from other authorities. The same, however, often cannot be said about Shi’ite verdicts for the reason mentioned above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The methodology of the Sunni hadith critics is known, while the methodology behind Al-Tusi&#8217;s and Al-Najashi’s conclusions is obscure and unknown.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite polemicists cannot claim that the Sunni critics weakened these transmitters on a sectarian basis, since two-thirds of the transmitters I have listed were declared to be Sunnis in Shi’ite sources. In fact, some of these transmitters listed above transmitted reports that support Sunni theology in Sunni sources! Asram b. Hawshab, for example, transmits a report demonstrating the virtues of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Ali (Al-Tabarani 37), yet he was still declared to be a forger by Sunni scholarship!</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These arguments apply to almost every single instance where Shi’ite authorities endorsed transmitters that were criticized and condemned by the Sunni hadith critics. Nevertheless, this phenomenon merely demonstrates the arbitrary nature of authentication in Shi’ite sources along with the disastrous conclusions that result from this methodology.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">10. The Substantive Evidence That Major Shi’ite Authorities in Hadith Tampered with Reports</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Substantive evidence exists to suggest (and even prove) that several major Shi’ite hadith authorities tampered with reports. The reliability of their works is thus immediately dismissed and put into question.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our friend, Farid Al-Bahraini, has published a <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/sdm_downloads/the-distortions-of-al-saduq/">study</a> where he outlines around forty examples where the grand Shi’ite muhaddith, Al-Shaykh Al-Saduq (d. 381), was caught tampering with reports due to various reasons. The implications of this study are grave: Al-Saduq authored many books, and tens of different hadith compilations. His book, <em>Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih</em>, is one of the four major hadith collections (<em>Al-Kutub Al-Arba’ah</em>). Thus, the indictment of this author would result in a loss of thousands of reports, upon which many elements of Shi’ite theology and jurisprudence are based.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have also identified an instance where Al-Kulayni, author of Al-Kafi, <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/11/29/al-kulayni-tampers-narration/">distorted and tampered</a> with a report in his book. There are other instances where Al-Kulayni was caught tampering with reports, and we shall share them in the near future; God willing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these arguments, alone, are enough to question the reliability of a variety of Twelver sources. However, if we were to combine all these points into a single argument, we would have a powerful cumulative case to question, dismiss and reject the reliability of the Twelver hadith tradition. Thus, we shall conclude this paper by reminding you, O reader, of what the great tabi’i, Ibn Sirin, once said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Indeed, this knowledge is religion, so be careful from whom you take your religion.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lebanese Shi’ite scholar, Sayyed Ja’far Murtaza Al-Ameli (b. 1945), is the author of one of the most important Shi’ite works on the Seerah, “Al-Sahih min Seerat Al-Nabi Al-A’ẓam”, which is in 35 volumes. At first glance, the observer may find himself amazed at the sheer enormousness of this “encyclopedia”, since normal and classical Seerah works usually are not more than a few volumes in size. The careful observer, however, will quickly recognize how defective of a work this waste of paper truly is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sayyed Ja’far begins his book with a rant against Sunni sources. He then proceeds to criticize Sunni sources for a variety of claims they’ve supposedly made about the Prophet, which he believes are blasphemous and unbefitting of the Prophet.  After outlining a few examples, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Add to that: that the Prophet supposedly fell in love with his adopted son’s wife after seeing her in an arousing state.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sayyed Ja’far, over here, is referring to a variety of extremely weak reports found in some Sunni sources where the Prophet is said to have fell in love with Zaynab bint Jahsh after seeing her beauty, which ultimately led to the divorce of Zaynab and Zayd b. Harithah and Zaynab and the Prophet’s eventual marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, these reports are extremely weak in <u>Sunni</u> sources. I shall list some of the main isnads to this supposed incident in Sunni sources:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Ibn Sa’d, Al-Tabari &amp; Al-Hakem transmit this report through Al-Waqidi [liar], from ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amer Al-Aslami [weak], from Muhammad b. Yahya b. Hibban, from the Prophet [disconnected between Muhammad b. Yahya &amp; the Prophet.]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a></li>
<li>Al-Tabarani, Ibn Abi ‘Asem, and Abu Nu’aym transmitted it through Muhammad b. Khaled b. ‘Athmah [trustworthy transmitter who makes mistakes], from Musa b. Ya’qub [trustworthy transmitter who has a bad memory], from ‘Abdulrahman b. Al-Munib [unknown], from Abu Bakr b. Sulayman, from the Prophet [disconnected between Abu Bakr b. Sulayman and the Prophet.]<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a></li>
<li>Ibn ‘Adiyy transmits this supposed incident from Al-Saji [reliable], from Al-Hasan b. ‘Ali Al-Wasiti [reliable], from ‘Ali b. Nuh [unknown], from Muhammad b. Kathir [very weak], from Sulaym [weak], from Al-Sha’bi, from the Prophet [disconnected between Al-Sha’bi and the Prophet]<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref3">[4]</a></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident Sayyed Ja’far disregards the fact that Sunni scholarship has held the position that these reports are clearly inauthentic, and he even cites these reports as a reason to dismiss the credibility of Sunni primary historical sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is ironic, however, is that this very same incident is authentically reported in Shi’ite sources!<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his tafsir, ‘Ali b. Ibrahim Al-Qommi transmits an authentic report on verse #4 from Surat Al-Ahzab which is even more explicit than the weak reports found in Sunni sources. We shall only quote the relevant excerpt from this report, since it is quite long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My father informed me, from Ibn Abi ‘Umayr, from Jamil, from Abu ‘Abdullah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Medina, the Prophet betrothed Zaynab unto Zayd. One day, Zaid was late, so the Prophet visited his house to inquire about him. There, he saw Zaynab sitting in the middle of her house crushing fragrances. He looked at her, and she was beautiful and lovely, so he said: “Exalted is the Creator of light! And Exalted is Allah the best of creators!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Messenger of Allah then returned to his house, and his heart had an astounding attachment to Zaynab. Then, Zayd eventually returned to his house, and Zaynab informed him of what the Prophet had said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zayd then told her: “Shall I divorce you such that Messenger of Allah may marry you? Perhaps he has fallen in love with you?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She said: “I fear that you may divorce me and then the Messenger of Allah ends up not marrying me.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zayd thus went to the Prophet and told him: “I spare you with my father and mother O&#8217; Messenger of Allah. Zaynab informed me of such-and-such. Shall I divorce her such that you may marry her?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Messenger of Allah then responded: “No. Fear Allah and keep your wife.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then Allah revealed the verse: “[as you said]: ‘Keep your wife and fear Allah,’ while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.” [Al-Ahzaab: 37]<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref4">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident this is an authentic report according to Twelver standards which mentions this forged story with additional details that are not even present in the weak Sunni accounts. Thus, this is quite ironic that Sayyed Ja’far attempts to discredit Sunni sources by appealing to a report that is weak in Sunni sources yet authentic in Shi’ite sources!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully, we can all learn from Sayyed Ja’far’s blunder(s) and recognize that upholding double standards is not an intellectually honest way to promote your religion or historical narrative. Otherwise, perhaps Sayyed Ja’far was simply demonstrating his ignorance and lack of exposure to Shi’ite texts?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It may come as a surprise to many Shīas, that there are multiple hadīths in the classical Shīa works that speak of thirteen Imāms instead of twelve. Today, Shīa scholars would dismiss these are scribal errors. These reports often state that there will be Twelve Imāms from the descendants of the Prophet – peace be upon him – , meaning that `Alī is excluded from the Twelve.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidences for Thirteen Imāms</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Abdillāh bin Moḥammad Al-Kashshāb, from Ibn Samā`a, from `Alī bin Al-Ḥasan bin Ribāṭ, from Ibn Uḏayna, from Zurārah, that he said: I heard Abā Ja`afar (as) say: “<strong>The Twelve Imāms</strong> from the household of Moḥammad (peace be upon him and his household) are all spoken to (by angels), from the descendants of the Messenger  (peace be upon him and his household) and <strong>from the descendants of `Alī</strong>, and the Messenger of Allah and `Alī (as) are the fathers.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Kulaynī<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> narrated this hadīth through the path of Abī `Alī Al-Ash`arī, from Al-Ḥasan bin Ubaydillāh, from Al-Ḥasan bin Mūsā Al-Kashshāb from `Alī bin Samā`a.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hadīth was also reported by Al-Ṣaffār.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn, from Ibn Maḥbūb, from Abī Al-Jārūd, from Abī Ja`afar (as), that he said: “I entered upon Fāṭima (as) and in front of her was a tablet with the names of the <em>awsiya’ </em>(successors) <strong>from her descendants. I counted twelve</strong> with the last being Al-Qā`im (the Mahdī) (as). Three were named Moḥammad and three were named `Alī.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Ṭūsī narrates this hadīth through an alternative chain with the same wording.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3-  Al-Kulaynī narrated from Moḥammad bin Yaḥyā, from Moḥammad bin Aḥmad, from Moḥammad bin Al-Ḥusayn, from Abī Sa`īd Al-Uṣfurī, from `Amr bin Thābit, from Abī Al-Jārūd, from Abī Ja`afar (as) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his household) said: “Me and <strong>twelve of my descendants, and you O’ `Al</strong><strong>ī</strong>, are the stakes and the mountains of the earth. Allah uses us to hold firm the earth and not collapse, and if the <strong>Twelve from my descendants disappear</strong>, then the earth would collapse immediately.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Al-Kulaynī, with the same chain, from Abī Sa`īd, who narrated it from Abī Ja`afar in a disconnected form, from Abī Ja`afar (as), that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his household) said: “<strong>From my descendants are twelve honorable leaders</strong> that are spoken to (by angels), the last of them is the <em>Q</em><em>ā</em><em>`im</em> (the Mahdi) who shall fill it (the earth) with justice in the way it was filled with tyranny.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Al-Karājiki quotes Aḥmad bin Moḥammad bin Sa`īd, from Al-Qāsim bin Moḥammad bin Ubayd, from Ibn Kallūb, from Al-Ḥusayn bin Zayd bin `Alī, from Ja`afar bin Moḥammad, from his fathers, that `Alī said: The Messenger (peace be upon him and his household) said “…how can a nation with me in it, as well as <strong>twelve of my satisfied wise descendants</strong>, at its forefront, and the Messiah the son of Mary, in the end, fall to its demise?! Rather, the destruction shall occur to those in between, those who are not from me nor am I from them!”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- The earliest Shīa book, Kitāb Sulaym bin Qays, included evidence that the Imāms are thirteen. See below.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Thirteen?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reports that indicate that the Imāms were thirteen do not seem to be based upon any ideological basis, for there was no early “Thirteener” Movement. Unlike the reports that indicate that the Imāms are twelve, the reports above, are not ideologically driven. It is very possible that one of these reports was concocted with an arbitrary number and that it went on to spawn multiple hadīths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the fact that the book of Sulaym included the number thirteen, it is safe to say that this number most likely predated the number twelve, since Sulaym was a <em>tabi’ī</em>, who passed away in the first century of Islam.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Correcting the Imāms</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that each and every one of the six points provided above has been in a way “corrected”, in order to fit with the Twelver narrative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had previously analyzed examples #1 and #5 previously,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and I have concluded that these late distortions appear to have occurred at the hands of “Al-Ṣadūq”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Report #2 was tampered with multiple times in the works of Ibn Bābūyah,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> where the words “from her descendants” were removed. However, Ibn Bābūyah also quotes it with the same wording as Al-Kāfī in some of his other works,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> which indicate that these reports were manipulated by someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narrations #3 and #4 were tampered with as well. Both can be found in the <em>asl</em> of `Abbād Al-`Usfurī<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> with the number “eleven” replacing the number “twelve”. Even though the <em>asl</em> predates Al-Kāfī, the original manuscript was written in 374 AH by Manṣūr bin Al-Ḥasan bin Al-Ḥusayn Al-Ābī, fifty years after Al-Kulaynī. Furthermore, there is absolutely no reason for Al-Kulaynī to sabotage the hadīths of `Abbād, while it is favorable for the copyist to do so. However, one cannot be certain as to whether these distortions occurred at the hands of Al-Ābī, for it may have occurred by an earlier narrator or perhaps a later copyist. Naturally, we can be reassured that Al-Kāfī’s wordings are more representative of what `Abbād had originally written.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Number of Imāms in the Book of Sulaym</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally we come to the report of Sulaym bin Qays in his book, which according to Ibn Al-Ghaḍa`irī, advocated that the number of Imāms are thirteen.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> He denounces the book as a forgery due to this as well as other reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hibatullāh bin Aḥmad bin Moḥammad Al-Kātib, propagated this belief based on the contents of the book of Sulaym. He was the grandson of one of the emissaries of the Mahdī, who authored a work in which he claimed that the Imāms were thirteen, and included Zayd bin `Alī as one of them. He relied on a hadīth that stated that “the Imāms from the descendants of `Alī are twelve,” which could be found in the book of Sulaym. Hibatullāh passed away in the fifth century. Al-Najāshī, who provides us with this biographical information, puts no effort into correcting Hibatullāh’s usage of the report in the book of Sulaym. <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Mufīd<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> is not explicit about the number of Imāms, however, he does state that the book should not be relied upon, apparently due to hidden manipulations. It wouldn’t be surprising if Al-Mufīd held this opinion due to the reasons held by Ibn Al-Ghaḍā`irī.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in modern prints of the book of Sulaym today, we find that the number of Imāms is clearly twelve. Moḥammad Bāqir Al-Anṣārī, the editor of the book, quotes 24 instances in which they are numbered as twelve.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Is it possible that Ibn Al-Ghaḍā`irī, Hibatullāh Al-Kātib, and by extension Al-Najāshī all overlooked these instances?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears as though the case for Thirteen Imāms was one that was lost in time due to both the strength of the Twelver movement, as well as the manipulations in the hadīths. These manipulations would have most likely occurred during the <em>ghaybah</em> period, after the passing away of Al-Ḥasan Al-`Askarī, to support the Twelver ideology that only finally evolved into that form by the middle of the third century.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi’ite polemicists often ask Sunnis: “How do you claim that the Sahabah are all just role models when you yourselves acknowledge that they all fought each other?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though this question embodies several fallacious premises, one eventually finds himself questioning its main premise: “Did the Sahabah all actually fight each other as implied by the question?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It must not be a surprise to the Sunni reader that this appeal is one of the many fallacious and dishonest appeals made by Shi’ite polemicists. The <em>fitnah</em> between Ali and Mu’awiyah is presented as some grand-scale cosmic war that took place where most companions of the Prophet ﷺ viciously slaughtered each other. However, the evidence indicates that only a tiny fraction of the Sahabah actually participated in the <em>fitnah</em> between Ali and Mu’awiyah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Argument</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyah said: “Regarding the Sahabah, the majority (<em>jumhoor)</em> of them, including the majority of the virtuous among them, did not participate in a <em>fitnah</em>.” (Ibn Taymiyah 6: 236)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Bakr b. Al-Khallal in <em>Kitab Al-Sunnah </em>(#428) &amp; Ibn Shabbah in <em>Tarikh al-Madinah</em> (4/271) authentically reported that the major <em>tabi’i</em>, Ibn Sirin said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The <em>fitnah </em>raged, and the companions of the Prophet were around ten thousand in number at that time; and less than a hundred of them attended it. In fact, there were not more than thirty of them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Abdullah b. Ahmed in <em>Kitab Al-‘Ilal </em><em>wa Ma’rifat Al-Rijal</em> (#462) transmits a report from his father, Ahmed b. Hanbal, who said: Umayyah b. Khalid once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I told Sho’bah: Abu Shaybah told us from Al-Hakam, from ‘Abdurrahman b. Abi Laylah that he said: “Seventy men from the people of Badr witnessed the Battle of Siffin.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sho’bah responded: “By Allah, he has lied! I have revised this matter with Al-Hakam. We went over this in his house, and we found that no one from among the people of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Badr witness the battle of Siffin except Khuzaymah b. Thabet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Bakr b. Al-Khallal in <em>Kitab Al-Sunnah</em> (#726) also transmit this report from ‘Abdullah b. Ahmed b. Hanbal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Taymiyah comments on this report saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say: This negation indicates the extreme scarcity of companions who attended the battle, and it is said that Sahl b. Hanif and Abu Ayyub attended it is as well; and Ibn Sirin’s statement is accurate: there are barely a hundred men listed [among the companions who attended the battle]. (Ibn Taymiyah 6: 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, if one were to say (for argument’s sake) that a hundred companions of the Prophet participated in the conflict, then that’d be almost 1%. If we were to say that around thirty Sahabis took part in the conflict, as reported by Ibn Sirin, then that means &lt; 0.3% of the Sahabah were involved in the <em>fitnah!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Few Notable Companions of the Prophet Who Did Not Participate in the Fitnah</strong></h2>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Sa&#8217;d b. Abi Waqqas</li>
<li>Ibn ‘Umar</li>
<li>Anas b. Malik</li>
<li>Usamah b. Zaid</li>
<li>Abu Huraira</li>
<li>Abu Bakrah</li>
<li>Abu Mas’ud Al-Badri</li>
<li>Suhayb Al-Rumi</li>
<li>Salamah b. Al-Akwa’</li>
<li>‘Imran b. Hosain</li>
<li>Muhammad b. Maslamah</li>
<li>Jarir b. ‘Abdillah</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident, most companions of the Prophet ﷺ refrained from participating in the conflict between Ali and Mu’awiyah. In fact, several reports display some of these companions refusing to take part in the conflict.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> For example, Bukhari reports in his Sahih (#7110) that Harmalah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usamah [ b. Zaid] sent me to Ali, and he told me: “He (Ali) shall ask you: what prevents your companion from coming?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Respond to him saying: He (Usamah) tells you: “If you were between the jaws of a lion, I would have loved to be by your side; however, I shall not take part in this matter. (Bukhari 9: 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Muslim reports in his Sahih (#2965) that ‘Amer b. Sa’d said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sa’d b. Abi Waqqas was tending his camels, and then his son, ‘Umar, approached him. When Sa’d saw him approaching, he said: “I seek refuge in Allah from the evil of this rider.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Umar [b. Sa’d] then told him: “You tend to your camels and livestock, and you leave the people fight for power among themselves?!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sa’d then hit his chest and said: “Be quiet! I’ve heard the Messenger of Allah say: Allah loves the God-conscious, unneedy and unnoticed slave.” (Muslim 4: 277)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme is clear: most of the companions of the Prophet were not interested in shedding Muslim blood throughout this conflict. In fact, authentic reports in Shi’ite sources demonstrate key members of Ahlulbait asserting this theme as well:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq, for example, in <em>Kitab Al-Khisal </em>(p. 639-640) authentically quotes Ja’far Al-Sadeq praising the companions in this context. Al-Saduq says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahmed b. Ziyad b. Ja’far Al-Hamadani may Allah be pleased with him said: ‘Ali b. Ibrahim b. Hashem told us, from his father, from Muhammad b. Abi ‘Umayr, from Hisham b. Abi Salem, from Abu ‘Abdillah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companions of the Prophet ﷺ were 12,000 in number: Eight thousand of them were in Medina, two thousand were in Mecca, two thousand of them were among the <em>Tulaqaa’</em>. None of them was a <em>Qadari</em>, a <em>Murji’</em>, a <em>Haruri </em>(Khariji), a <em>Mo’tazilite, </em>nor a man of <em>Ra’y</em>. They used to cry in the day and night, and they’d say: “[O Allah] take our souls before we eat yeast bread.”  (Al-Saduq 640)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Referring to the luxury of eating yeast bread at the time.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though participating in the conflict does not delegitimize the status and reliability of any companion of the Prophet, it is unfair for Shias to judge the vast majority of the Sahabah according to an action carried out by a tiny minority among them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the Sahabah, as demonstrated, refrained from participating in the conflict between Ali and Mu’awiyah, and the burden of proof is upon the Shi’as to demonstrate otherwise.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A hadith commonly cited in Sunni-Shia polemics is a report pertaining to a Quranic verse where Allah says: “You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.” (13:7)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias appeal to a report where ‘Ali is supposedly quoted interpreting this verse by stating that the “warner” was the Prophet, and that the “guide” is ‘Ali, himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The evaluation of the report will address several matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A presentation of the different versions of the report.</li>
<li>An analysis of their transmitters.</li>
<li>An analysis of their isnads and contexts.</li>
<li>The content of these reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Reports:</u></strong></h2>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Hakem and Ibn al-A’rabi transmit the report through ‘Abdurrahman b. Muhammad b. Mansur al-Harithi, from al-Husain b. al-Hasan al-Ashqar, from Mansur b. Abi al-Aswad, from al-A’mash, from al-Minhal b. ‘Amr, from ‘Abbad b. ‘Abdillah al-Asadi, from ‘Ali that he said:</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Messenger of Allah is the warner and I (Ali) am the guide.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li>‘Abdullah b. Ahmed, al-Tabarani, Ibn Abi Hatem and others transmitted a similar report through ‘Uthman b. Abi Shaybah, from al-Muttalib b. Ziyad, from al-Suddi, from ‘Abdi Khayr, from ‘Ali that he said:</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The guide is a man from Bani Hashem.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When studying the status of a transmitter, it is important to comprehensively list all the statements of the hadith critics pertaining to his status and reliability. A selective reading of a transmitter’s status will lead to a limited and incomplete conclusion that is simply inaccurate. If the critics’ verdicts pertaining to the reliability of a transmitter contradict each other, then one must consider several indicators when deciding the reliability of the said transmitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if a transmitter was criticized for an explicitly mentioned reason, then general and vague praise cannot be cited to negate that specific criticism. Similarly, critics closer to the transmitter in time may have a more accurate outlook than later critics. However, the reality of the matter is that the critics are mostly in agreement when it comes to the reliability of transmitters.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Transmitter Analysis of 1<sup>st</sup> Report:</u></strong></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>‘Abdurrahman b. Muhammad is not reliable:
<ul>
<li>Al-Daraqutni said: “He is not strong.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
<li>Ibn ‘Adiyy said: “He transmits reports that are not corroborated by anyone.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></li>
<li>Abu Hatem al-Razi said: “A sheikh”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. (This is a known form of criticism according to Abu Hatem.)</li>
<li>Maslamah b. al-Qasem declared him to be reliable.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Hibban mentions him in his book, <em>al-Thiqaat,</em> which is an encyclopedia of transmitters that are reliable according to Ibn Hibban.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen, ‘Abdurrahman b. Ahmed is a contested transmitter, and one cannot conclude that he is reliable. In fact, he is weak, since the hadith critics that criticized him substantiated their verdicts with actual evidence, such as what Ibn ‘Adiyy had stated. Thus, this criticism takes precedence over the general praise some later critics gave him.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Husain b. al-Hasan al-Ashqar is extremely weak:
<ul>
<li>Abu Zur’ah said: “He was a sheikh who was <em>munkar </em>in his hadith.”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
<li>Al-Nasa’i and al-Daraqutni: said: “He wasn’t strong.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
<li>Abu Ma’mar al-Qati’i said: “He was a liar.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Ma’in said: “There was nothing wrong with him.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></li>
<li>Al-Bukhari said: “He has <em>manakir</em> (objectionable reports) .”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
<li>Abu Ahmed al-Hakem said: “He was not strong according to the hadith critics.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
<li>Ahmed b. Hanbal said: “I don’t consider him to be someone who lies.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></li>
<li>Abu al-Fath al-Azdi said: “He was weak.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></li>
<li>Abu Hatem al-Razi said: “He wasn’t strong.”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen, Al-Husain clearly is a weak and unreliable transmitter; however, the debate merely revolves around whether he was a forger or not. Either way, he is extremely weak and cannot be relied upon when exclusively transmitting a report.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Mansur b. Abi al-Aswad is generally reliable.</li>
<li>Al-A’mash is a well-known Imam and reliable transmitter, however, he was a <em>mudallis</em>. A <em>mudallis</em> is a transmitter who regularly drops the intermediary between him and the transmitter above him, rendering the report disconnected. Thus, a <em>mudallis’ </em>report can only be accepted if he explicitly mentions hearing the report from the transmitter above him. In this case, al-A’mash does NOT state that he heard it.</li>
<li>Al-Minhal b. ‘Amr was reliable:</li>
<li>‘Abbad b. ‘Abdillah is not reliable:
<ul>
<li>Al-Bukhari said: “<em>fihi nadhar.”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></em> (This, in fact, is indicative of his extreme weakness as stated by several scholars.)</li>
<li>‘Ali b. al-Madini said: “He is weak.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Hibban mentioned him in al-Thiqat<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, and al-‘Ijli declared him to be reliable.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Hazm said: “He is unknown.”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Hajar concluded that he was weak.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Isnad Analysis of 1<sup>st</sup> Report:</u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This report seems to be extremely weak for several reasons:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>‘Abdurrahman b. Muhammad’s weakness.</li>
<li>‘Abdurrahman b. Muhammad’s exclusive transmission from al-Husain b. al-Hasan.</li>
<li>Al-Husain b. al-Hasan’s extreme weakness.</li>
<li>Al-Husain b. Al-Hasan’s exclusive transmission from Masnur b. Abi al-Aswad.</li>
<li>Mansur’s exclusive transmission from al-A’mash.
<ul>
<li>In fact, this is a red flag, since al-A’mash had a plethora of major students who regularly transmitted from him, such as Sho’bah, Abu Mu’awiyah,Sufyan al-Thawri etc. The fact that this report is exclusively transmitted through a less known transmitter while none of the greater students of al-A’mash transmitted it could be indicative of the existence of a major defect in the transmission of this report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>tadlis </em>of al-A’mash since al-A’mash does not explicitly mention hearing the report. Thus, we cannot ascertain the connectivity of the isnad between al-A’mash and al-Minhal b. ‘Amr.</li>
<li>‘Abbad b. ‘Abdillah al-Asadi’s weakness</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen, this report is extremely weak, and it cannot be cited as evidence in any context. In fact, al-Dhahabi states that this reportis a fabrication that was forged by al-Husain b. al-Hasan.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Transmitter Analysis of 2<sup>nd</sup> Report:</u></strong></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>‘Uthman b. Abi Shaybah is reliable.</li>
<li>Muttalib b. Ziyad’s reliability is contested:
<ul>
<li>Abu Hatem said: “His hadith should be written but he cannot be relied upon when exclusively transmitting a report.”<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></li>
<li>Ibn Sa’d said: “He is extremely weak in hadith.”<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></li>
<li>Ahmed b. Hanbal, al-‘Ijli, Ibn Shahin. And ‘Uthman b. Abi Shaybah declared him to be reliable, and Ibn Hibban mentioned him in <em>al-Thiqaat</em>.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></li>
<li>Abu Dawud said: “He is acceptable to me.”<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></li>
<li>‘Isa b. Shadhan weakened him and said: “He has <em>manakir </em>(objectionable reports).”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></li>
<li>On one occasion, Yahya b. Ma’in declared him to be reliable. <a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a> On another occasion, Yahya reportedly declared him to be weak.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen, he is weak. The criticism takes precedence over the general praise since the criticism was made for specific reasons (i.e. ‘Isa b. Shadhan’s quote) which cannot be negated with general praise.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Suddi is weak:
<ul>
<li>Abu Hatem al-Razi said: “His hadith should be written but he cannot be relied upon when exclusively transmitting a report.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></li>
<li>Al-‘Uqaili declared him to be weak.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></li>
<li>Abu Zur’ah said: “He is <em>layyin </em>(weak).”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></li>
<li>Layth b. Abi Sulaym and al-Jawzajani declared him to be a liar.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></li>
<li>Al-Tabari said: “His hadith cannot be relied upon.”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></li>
<li>Ahmed b. Hanbal, al-Nasa’i, al-‘Ijli, and Ibn ‘Adiyy deemed him reliable.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></li>
<li>Yahya b. Ma’in declared him to be weak.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‘Abd Khayr is reliable</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><u>Isnad Analysis of 2<sup>nd</sup> Report:</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This report seems to be weak for several reasons:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Muttalib b. Ziyad’s weakness.</li>
<li>Muttalib b. Ziyad’s exclusive transmission from al-Suddi.</li>
<li>Al-Suddi’s weakness.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, this report too is weak, even though it doesn’t even explicitly mention Ali anyways. However, it is not as weak as the first report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Analysis of Content:</u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As seen, there is a disparity in the content of both reports. In the first report, the name of ‘Ali is explicitly mentioned, while ‘Ali is not mentioned in the second report. Some Shias have presented a conspiracy theory claiming that‘Ali’s name was purposely omitted from the second report by Sunni historians; however, this claim is flawedfor several reasons:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>There is not a single bit of evidence to substantiate this claim.</li>
<li>The report that explicitly mentions Ali’s name is much weaker than the other report where ‘Ali is not mentioned.</li>
<li>If the Sunni muhaddithin’s goal was to hide ‘Ali’s relationship with the verse, then there’d be no point in transmitting this interpretation of the verse through him with vague wording that could still apply to him, since he still was a man from Bani Hashem after all.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This interpretation of 13:7 from the Quran is not authentic to ‘Ali b. Abi Taleb. The report that explicitly mentions Ali’s name is a baseless forgery as stated by several scholars. The other report where Ali’s name is not explicitly mentioned is very weak as well; however, it is not as weak as the first report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As evident, both reports supposedly interpret this verse are inauthentic; thus, one may ask, “What is the actual interpretation of the verse?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the baseless opinion that the verse refers to Ali b. Abi Taleb, Al-Tabari lists a variety of potential interpretations of the verse held by classical scholarship. He lists a variety of reports (authentic and weak) pertaining to the opinions listed below:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The guide is the Prophet himself.</li>
<li>The guide is meant to be Allah, such that Muhammad is the warner and Allah is the guide.</li>
<li>The verse refers to how each nation was given a prophet.</li>
<li>“Guide” refers to a leader.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is commonly accepted among the Shias today that Sunnis are praying the Maghrib prayers before the time that has been stipulated by the Shari’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Sunnis, as long as the actual sun&#8217;s disc disappears, the time is  Maghrib. As for Shias, they maintain that the time of Maghrib is when the redness of the East is no longer visible, which occurs around ten to fifteen minutes after the actual sun disappears (and perhaps even longer depending on the region). This is especially significant in Ramadan, since Shias argue that Sunnis are breaking their fast before Maghrib time, and thus, their fasting is not accepted. To support this belief, Shias often bring forth multiple narrations to support this position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Imams, in many occasions, also stated that Maghrib occurs when the sun&#8217;s disc disappears.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Narrations</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wasa’el Al-Shia 4/177-183 provides a large list of the narrations that support the view that Maghrib starts when the sun&#8217;s disc disappears:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Al-Jarud said: Abu Abdullah (as) said, “I now pray it (Maghrib) when sun’s disc has fallen.”</li>
<li>Al-Kafi/Al-Tahtheeb: Abdullah bin Sinan said: I heard Abu Abdullah (as) say, “The time of Maghrib is when the sun sets and the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Kafi/Al-Tahtheeb: Zurarah said: I heard Abu Ja’afar (as) say, “Maghrib is when the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Abu Ja’afar (as) said, “Maghrib is when the disc disappears.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Al-Sadiq (as) said, “If the sun disappears, then it is time to break the fast and prayer becomes obligatory.”</li>
<li>Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh: Jabir (Al-Ju’fi) narrated from Abu Ja’afar (as) that he said, “The Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) said: If the disc disappears, he who fasts eats, and the time of prayer has begun.”</li>
<li>Amali Al-Saduq: Dawud bin Abi Yazeed said: Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) said, “If the sun disappears, the time of Maghrib has occurred.”</li>
<li>Amali Al-Saduq: Al-Rabee’ bin Sulaiman, Aban bin Arqam, and others narrated that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) prayed while sunlight was noticeable. When asked, he said, “If the sun sets, the time of prayer has occurred.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb/Amali Al-Saduq/Ilal Al-Shara’i’: Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) was asked about the time of Maghrib. He said, “When the <em>kursi </em>disappears.” He was asked, “What is its <em>kursi</em>?” He replied, “Its disc.” He asked, “When does the disc disappear?” He said, “If you look at it and cannot see it.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Isma’eel bin Al-Fadhl Al-Hashimi narrated from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as), who said, “The Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) prayed Maghrib when the sun sets, when the edge disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Abu Baseer said that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) said, “The time of Maghrib is when the sun disappears.”</li>
<li>Al-Tahtheeb: Amr bin Abi Nasr said that he heard Ja’afar Al-Sadiq (as) say about Maghrib, “When the disc disappears, it is time for prayer, and (time to) eat.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shia Explanation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arguing against the authenticity of these reports does not occur since the above reports are plenty in number. Furthermore, some of them are indeed authentic according to Shia hadith standards, like the hadiths of Abdullah bin Sinan, Zurarah, and Dawud bin Abi Yazeed. Due to this, Shias focus on reconciling these reports with others that speak of Maghrib occurring when the redness of the East disappears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: It is important to be aware that there are more authentic reports the support the view that Maghrib starts when the disc disappears than the reports that supports the view that it starts after the redness of the East disappears.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Excuse #1: Reconciliation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The argument is that these reports speak of one of the two conditions of Maghrib, which is the disappearance of the disc of the sun. The other condition is the disappearance of the redness of the East. In other words, the claim is that the followers of the Imam need to place these narrations together and to hold the view that Maghrib occurs after both these conditions are met.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This argument is very flawed, since it means that the reports provided above are incomplete in nature, and result to a false understanding of the time of Maghrib. Take the following scenario as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we had two reports, one saying that the Imam stated that the time of Maghrib is <strong>after 6pm</strong> and the other saying that it is <strong>at 6:15pm</strong>, then according to this rationale, breaking the fast at 6:15pm is the correct view since 6:15pm occurs after 6pm. Obviously, our response is that everyone that follows the first hadith and breaks the fast from 6:01-6:14pm has invalidated their fast due to the incomplete information provided by the Imam.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Excuse #2: Taqiyyah</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The go-to excuse that is provided by every Shia scholar in cases of contradictions is the handy <em>taqiyyah </em>card. The argument is: Since Sunnis break the fast upon the disappearance of the disc, it is only natural to assume that the Imams they practiced <em>taqiyyah</em> to appeal to Sunnis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dangers of this belief are devastating. It suggests that the Imams, that were sent as guides for humanity, falsely taught people to break their fast at an invalid time. This disastrous belief goes against the very reason for the existence of the Imam: Guidance.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The explanations that are provided to solve the issue of the contradicting reports fall short. It becomes obvious that the Imams either truly contradicted themselves or that these are false attributions to them by their companions or by Shia narrators in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Objective Shias are perhaps left without a resolution to this contradiction, since there are no external evidences to support either position. However, this dilemma isn’t restricted to this <em>fiqhi</em> topic alone, but can be found in all sections of Shia Shari’ah, which is one of the major issues with Shia hadith and the failure of their hadith grading system.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">by Abdullah Moataz</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p id="h.p_upC2hPFIV261" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">One of the more profound hadiths regarding the superiority of ‘Ali b. Abi Talib and his virtues, is a hadith found in Sahih Muslim. Shi’ite polemicists constantly use the hadith in their proselytizing efforts with Sunnis. The hadith in Muslim is worded as follows:</p>
<p id="h.p_lWTs_sszV262" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">‘Ali b. Abi Talib said, “I swear by Him who split the seed and created people, it is the illiterate Prophet’s promise to me that none shall love me except a believer, and none shall hate me except a hypocrite.”</p>
<p id="h.p_kMEPkXbuV262" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Before going directly into the issue, I will give two introductions that, by the permission of Allah, will facilitate a better understanding of the issue at hand. The first issue is directly related to Sahih Muslim as a book, and the second issue relates to Al-Daraqutni’s criticism of the hadith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_ToRmzUtMV263" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim’s Methodology in his <em>Sahih</em></strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_LEO0QVfMV263" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Unlike many other compilers of hadith, Muslim b. Al-Hajjaj wrote an introduction to his Sahih. Besides the historical value of it, as well the wealth of information contained in it regarding hadith method, Muslim also details his methodology in compiling his Sahih. One of the important aspects of Muslim’s Sahih is his inclusion of defective reports in their relevant chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_Pw-UTpKxV264" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Essentially, and without going in too much detail on the topic, Muslim typically begins the chapter by mentioning the most authentic reports on the issue and following it up by mentioning reports of lesser transmitters, and then ending occasionally with a defective hadith. A more detailed study of this aspect of Muslim’s Sahih can be found in Hamzah Al-Malibari’s “<em>’Abqariyyat Al-Imam Muslim fi Tartib Ahadith Musnadihi Al-Sahih.” </em></p>
<p id="h.p_ydzNHFczV264" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">All that needs to be understood from this is that, not only is it possible that an inauthentic hadith appears in Sahih Muslim, but that it is likely that Muslim included it in his Sahih simply to demonstrate its inauthenticity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_4Ao0KVw-V265" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Al-Daraqutni’s Criticism</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_G8p7haJOV265" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In <em>Al-Tatabbu’</em>, where Al-Daraqutni compiled a selection of ahadith he considered to be weak in the two Sahihs, he includes the hadith in question. Al-Daraqutni, however, didn’t expressly state what he found problematic about the hadith. This left the door wide open for academics and researchers to determine what exactly Al-Daraqutni’s issue was.</p>
<p id="h.p_xK8YjkMxV266" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Rabi’ b. Hadi Al-Madkhali, in his master’s thesis “Bayn Al-Imamayn,” deals specifically with the portion of criticized ahadith found in Sahih Muslim. When analyzing the hadith, he understands, that the presence of ‘Adiyy b. Thabit, a reliable yet Shi’ite transmitter, is the cause of Al-Daraqutni’s concern and criticism (Al-Madkhali 39).</p>
<p id="h.p_gxIgfcZwV266" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">If Al-Madkhali is correct in his assumption, the crux of the issue would be concerning a heretic’s transmission in support of their heresy, a detailed and controversial issue found in the books of <em>Mustalah</em>.</p>
<p id="h.p_qPv6jt2iV267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Our friend Farid, challenged this assumption, and pointed out the existence of an actual hadith defect. After reflection, it appears that Farid’s hypothesis is more likely. If there is an actual hadith defect, there would be no reason to explain the criticism with a more elaborate and controversial explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_E3-uG-C5V267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Isnad</strong></em><strong> Analysis </strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_HYFxk6nEV267" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The hadith originates from Al-A’mash, from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit, from Zirr b. Hubaysh, from ‘Ali b. Abi Talib.</p>
<p id="h.p_i_zKCAszV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Al-A’mash is a famous <em>Hafiz</em>, and reliable transmitter, though occasionally practices <em>tadlis</em>. He needs no introduction.</p>
<p id="h.p_n-azpgMFV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">‘Adiyy b. Thabit is also a reliable transmitter despite his Shi’ite leanings.</p>
<p id="h.p_VyD4HQyIV269" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Abu Hatim Al-Razi said, “Trustworthy, and he was the Imam of the Shi’ite masjid, and their speaker” (Al-Razi 2)</p>
<p id="h.p_RQHv4tJcV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Ahmed b. Hanbal said, “‘Adiyy b. Thabit is reliable, though he used to be a Shi’ite” (B. Hanbal 490).</p>
<p id="h.p_fg3UFDVEV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">§ Al-Daraqutni said, “Reliable, though he was a Rafidi, very extreme in it” (Al-Sulami 210)</p>
<p id="h.p_mp4gOThbV26-" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Zirr b. Hubaysh is another reliable transmitter without controversy, though he is said to have anti-‘Ali leanings.</p>
<p id="h.p_MyVXJdDYV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In reality, the only defect in the chain would be the possibility of Al-A’mash’s <em>tadlis</em> here, which is unaccounted for. <em>Tadlis</em> is a way of transmitting hadith, wherein the “student” drops the intermediary, his source of transmission, and ambiguously transmits it from their mutual “teacher.” It is not a form of lying, as the “student” never expressly states they directly acquired the hadith from the “teacher.” Typically, transmitters guilty of this practice are scrutinized more, and their transmission isn’t accepted unless it is expressly stated how they acquired the report.</p>
<p id="h.p_xNEDQRCjV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">After a thorough search, I was unable to find any report where he expressly transmits it from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit.</p>
<p id="h.p_gHxdkTGeV26_" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Besides this glaring defect, we have another indicator that suggests this report was never actually transmitted by ‘Adiyy b. Thabit from Zirr b. Hubaysh.</p>
<p id="h.p_Oc0dnLnhV27A" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">As previously mentioned, Zirr b. Hubaysh was thought to have anti-‘Ali leanings. If this was the case, why would he be transmitted a hadith about the virtues of ‘Ali? Mind you, the hadith is not simply about the virtues of ‘Ali, but it is a highly exaggerated praise as well. While this point isn’t strong enough to stand alone, it is a factor that must be considered seriously, especially when there is an actual hadith defect present in the chain as well. The existence of <em>tadlis</em> in the chain, as well as this factor together, make a strong argument for the hadith’s inauthenticity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_v0ssMqY0V27B" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Muslim’s Placement</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_gLUra_9FV27C" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Muslim’s placement of the hadith is most interesting. In terms of topical placement, the hadith doesn’t seem to fit in its place. Muslim’s places it after five other hadith reports mentioning the virtues of the Ansar. Obviously, the hadith isn’t in the relevant chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_yuHY_7d1V27D" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In terms of ordering, it is the last hadith placed in the chapter.</p>
<p id="h.p_SCQG61f7V27D" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Why does Muslim do this? I would argue that Muslim’s actions may only be understood as an implicit criticism of the hadith. Consider the following point:</p>
<p id="h.p_aJCuJ9TtV27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">In the same chapter, Muslim records another hadith, originating from Shu’bah, who transmits it from ‘Adiyy b. Thabit. The premise of this hadith is similar to the one in question, with one major difference. Instead of it referring to ‘Ali, a lone individual, it refers to the Ansar, a group of people.</p>
<p id="h.p_pm_yRBhtV27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">What’s the issue? A critic would be very suspicious when seeing this. It is strange to find two independent reports, that supposedly have the same origin and source, both of which share in the major premise, yet differ in one part. For the critic, the more likely explanation, especially considering the other two factors previously mentioned, is that an error occurred in the transmission of the hadith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h.p_NUs0r264V27E" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Matn Analysis </strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_PtMu6N2uV27F" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The first clause of the report reads, “<strong>By Him who split the seed, and created people</strong>”</p>
<p id="h.p_V9FC15D_V27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">This phrase was actually used by ‘Ali at least once, as found in a hadith in Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p id="h.p_Er76rpzsV27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The second clause of the report reads, “<strong>It is the illiterate Prophet’s promise to me that</strong>…”</p>
<p id="h.p_QYEAsC_CV27G" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">As a phrase “The illiterate Prophet – Al-Nabi Al-Ummi,” is found in the Qur’an, as well as supplications, and others, as can be found in hadith literature. I was not able to find a single instance, authentically transmitted, where a Companion used this phrase in reference to the Prophet.</p>
<p id="h.p_ho6PxikWV27H" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">The third clause of the report reads, “<strong>None shall love me except a believer, and none shall hate me except a hypocrite.”</strong></p>
<p id="h.p_wrzqr-y2V27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">I find this clause to be problematic.</p>
<p id="h.p_zXDRsI2HV27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Hatred of an individual, with the exception of a Prophet, is never an act of disbelief or hypocrisy, unless the hatred directed to them is theological. This is perfectly demonstrated by an incident that happened during the Prophet’s life, as can be found in Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p id="h.p_U2-6CvVfV27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">An incident regarding the spoils of war occurred between Buraydah, and ‘Ali, which caused animosity between them from Buraydah’s side. He relates that he informed the Prophet of the incident, to which the Prophet asked him, “Do you hate ‘Ali?” Buraydah responded, “Yes.” The Prophet then said, “Don’t hate him, as his share in the Khums (fifth) is more than that.”</p>
<p id="h.p_FI_VuO08V27I" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Based on this account, the Prophet only told Buraydah to not hate ‘Ali. He didn’t add that was disbelief or that Buraydah was now a hypocrite due to his personal issues with ‘Ali. It makes complete sense that hatred of an individual would not be disbelief, since it is possible that a person could hate another based on a personal problem, as Buraydah did, and not due to disbelief. On the other hand, hatred of a certain group of people is liable to be a sign of disbelief, since a person cannot have a personal problem with a whole group of people. For example, hatred of the Ansar as a whole cannot be except due to disbelief, since the only common link between all of them is their Islam and status, therefore, hatred of them must be because of that. Whereas, if a person were to hate one individual from the Ansar, the same ruling wouldn’t apply, as it is very likely that the hatred could simply be as a result of a personal issue between the two.</p>

<h2 id="h.p_VfpxYmfqV27K" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p id="h.p_D71WYRIsV27L" class="zfr3Q" style="text-align: justify;">Though this hadith was included by Muslim in his <em>Sahih</em>, it isn’t authentic. It appears as though Muslim himself also believed this, and only reproduced the report in his <em>Sahih</em> to demonstrate its weakness in accordance with his methodology. Unlike some have suggested, the defect of the hadith is not ‘Adiyy b. Thabit or his Shi’ite leanings, but the <em>tadlis</em> of Al-A’mash. Furthermore, the implications of the report, if understood in its general or absolute sense, are false.</p>
