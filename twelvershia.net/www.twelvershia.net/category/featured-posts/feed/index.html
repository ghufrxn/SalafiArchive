PART-I: WHY ATTACK `UMAR FOR ESTABLISHING TARAWEEH?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peace be upon our dear readers, this article shall briefly discuss the practice known today as &#8220;Taraweeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taraweeh as you all know are voluntary night prayers performed in Ramadan after the obligatory `Isha&#8217; and before the Fajr of the next day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This prayer was not called &#8220;Tarweeh&#8221; at the time, it was later labeled by this name by Muslims and it became popular for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second Caliph of Islam, al-Farooq `Umar bin al-Khattab is accused by a group of deviants (the Shia) of having invented this horrible practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">`Umar may Allah be pleased with him is viewed by Shiites as an evil man whose main purpose is to break the pillars of Islam, weaken the faith and erase the true teachings of religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, `Umar is also viewed as a noble and pious believer with great achievements by the vast majority of Muslims throughout the ages, so how does that make sense? Well, Shiites explain that `Umar only presented outward Islam but internally was a selfish-hypocrite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first issue we tackle in this article is this accusation of hypocrisy. We Ahlul-Sunnah argue: what sense does it make for this evil and selfish person, to go out of his way and encourage people to pray extra during the month of Ramadan?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From what I understood, based on the Qur&#8217;an and the prophetic-teachings, a hypocrite is primarily a person who dislikes worshiping God and avoids it at all costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily} [4:142]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If `Umar detested prayer and wished to enjoy his time, why force himself to stand up for long hours at night for Taraweeh? Why invent Taraweeh and inconvenience himself with such annoyance?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right} [9:67]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And here we ask, is encouraging people to pray during the nights of Ramadan right or wrong? Was `Umar enjoining what&#8217;s wrong by advising them to pray more?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال النبي: أثقل الصلاة على المنافقين صلاة العشاء وصلاة الفجر ولو يعلمون ما فيهما لأتوهما ولو حبوا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Aba Hurayrah reported: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The most difficult prayers for hypocrites are the `Isha&#8217; and Fajr prayers. If only they knew the virtues of these two they would have crawled to attend them.&#8221; (Sahih al-Bukhari)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the above prophetic-narration, we see that two prayers are much more annoying for hypocrites than others, `Isha&#8217; and Fajr. Why is this? Because one of them is at night after a long tiring day of work while the other is early at dawn when people are sleepy, this is why hypocrites often skip them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, we notice that the prayer that `Umar upheld was AFTER `Isha&#8217;. Wouldn&#8217;t a hypocrite like to skip these long night prayers and rest at home? In fact, `Umar was assassinated while leading people during Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the above, we conclude that the Shia are not reasonable in their claim that `Umar bin al-Khattab was an evil-hypocrite who wished to corrupt the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PART-II: THE ORIGIN OF THE &#8220;TARAWEEH&#8221; PRAYER</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NEXT, we discuss the condition of the people before `Umar&#8217;s reign. What did the Prophet (saw) say about these extra night prayers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يُرَغِّبُ فِي قِيَامِ رَمَضَانَ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَأْمُرَهُمْ بِعَزِيمَةٍ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ‏ مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Aba Hurayrah narrates: The Messenger of God (saw) used to commend prayer at night during Ramadan but did not command it as a duty. He (saw) used to say: &#8220;Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer, out of piety and to seek God&#8217;s reward, his previous sins will be forgiven for him.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : إن الله عز وجل فرض صيام رمضان ، وسننت قيامه ، فمن صامه وقامه إيمانا واحتسابا ، خرج من ذنوبه كيوم ولدته أمه</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`Abdul-Rahman bin `Awf narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;God most glorious Has made Ramadan&#8217;s fast obligatory while I have made it my tradition to stay up in prayer during the nights. Whosoever shall fast and pray the nights in piety while seeking its rewards will be released from his sins as his mother released him at birth.&#8221; (Musnad Ahmad)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) encouraged them to spend the nights of Ramadan in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The Prophet (saw) never declared that Taraweeh was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- He (saw) described its great reward for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alright, so we understand from the above that the people were praying during the nights in the mosques and the houses to seek this great bounty. The question now is, were they praying these prayers together in congregation or was it individual worship?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ عَائِشَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهَا قَالَتْ: كَانَ النَّاسُ يُصَلُّونَ فِي مَسْجِدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فِي رَمَضَانَ بِاللَّيْلِ أَوْزَاعًا يَكُونُ مَعَ الرَّجُلِ الشَيْءُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ فَيَكُونُ مَعَهُ النَّفْرُ الْخَمْسَةُ أَوِ السِّتَّةُ وَأَقَلُّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَأَكْثَرُ , يُصَلُّونَ بِصَلَاتِهِ , قَالَتْ: فَأَمَرَنِي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَيْلَةً مِنْ ذَاكَ أَنْ أَنْصِبَ لَهُ حَصِيرًا عَلَى بَابِ حُجْرَتِي , فَفَعَلْتُ , فَخَرَجَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ بَعْدَ أَنْ صَلَّى الْعِشَاءَ الْآخِرَةَ فَاجْتَمَعَ إِلَيْهِ مَنْ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ فَصَلَّى بِهِمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ لَيْلًا طَوِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`A&#8217;ishah said: During Ramadan, the people used to pray at night inside the mosque of the Prophet (saw) and they&#8217;d be in random groups. If a man has memorized some Qur&#8217;an, he&#8217;d lead a party of five or six in these prayers. In one of these nights the Prophet (saw) ordered me to prepare for him a prayer mat outside my room and after he prayed the last `Isha&#8217; he left. Upon his arrival at the mosque, people gathered around him so he led them in long prayers during the night. (Nayl-ul-Awtar)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ ، قَالَ : صُمْنَا مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَمَضَانَ ، فَلَمْ يَقُمْ بِنَا شَيْئًا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ حَتَّى بَقِيَ سَبْعٌ ، فَقَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى ذَهَبَ ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ السَّادِسَةُ لَمْ يَقُمْ بِنَا ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الْخَامِسَةُ قَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى ذَهَبَ شَطْرُ اللَّيْلِ ، فَقُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ، لَوْ نَفَّلْتَنَا قِيَامَ هَذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ ، قَالَ : فَقَالَ : إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ إِذَا صَلَّى مَعَ الْإِمَامِ حَتَّى يَنْصَرِفَ حُسِبَ لَهُ قِيَامُ لَيْلَةٍ ، قَالَ : فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الرَّابِعَةُ لَمْ يَقُمْ ، فَلَمَّا كَانَتِ الثَّالِثَةُ جَمَعَ أَهْلَهُ وَنِسَاءَهُ وَالنَّاسَ ، فَقَامَ بِنَا حَتَّى خَشِينَا أَنْ يَفُوتَنَا الْفَلَاحُ ، قَالَ : قُلْتُ : وَمَا الْفَلَاحُ ؟ قَالَ : السُّحُورُ ، ثُمَّ لَمْ يَقُمْ بِقِيَّةَ الشَّهْرِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Abu Dharr reported: We fasted Ramadan with the Messenger of Allah (saw) and he did not lead us in the night prayers (i.e Qiyam) until there were seven days left of the month, then he led us in night prayers until one-third of the night had passed. Then, when there were six days left, he did not lead us. When there were five days left, he led us in praying the night until half that night had passed. At that point, I requested: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (saw), why don&#8217;t you lead us for the rest of this night?&#8221; He (saw) answered me: &#8220;Worry not, If a man prays with the leader until he leaves, it will be counted as if he spent the whole night in prayer.&#8221; Then, when there were four days left, he did not lead us in the night prayers. When there were three days left he sent for his daughters and women, and gathered the people, and he led us in praying all throughout the night until we feared that we would miss &#8220;al-Falah&#8221;. He did not lead for the remainder of that month.&#8221; Dawud (one of the narrators) asked: &#8220;What is al-Falah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;The time of Suhur.&#8221; (Sunan al-Tirmidhi)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) did lead them in the long night prayers during Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- He (saw) led them multiple times during the last third of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So an Imam leading the people during the Qiyam of the evening does not seem to be an innovation or a new invention but the question now is why this peculiar pattern? Why did the Prophet (saw) do it on some days and drop it at other times randomly?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عائشة &#8211; رضي الله عنها &#8211; : أن رسول الله &#8211; صلى الله عليه وسلم &#8211; صلى في المسجد ذات ليلة فصلى بصلاته ناس ، ثم صلى من القابلة فكثر الناس ، ثم اجتمعوا من الليلة الثالثة أو الرابعة ، فلم يخرج إليهم رسول الله &#8211; صلى الله عليه وسلم &#8211; فلما أصبح قال : &#8221; قد رأيت الذي صنعتم ، فلم يمنعني من الخروج إليكم إلا أني خشيت أن تفرض عليكم . قال : وذلك في رمضان</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[`A&#8217;ishah narrated: The Messenger (saw) prayed at the mosque one night and some people prayed behind him. Then he (saw) did similarly the next day and the number of people increased. On the third or fourth, people gathered but the Prophet (saw) never came out till morning, then he (saw) stood and addressed them saying: &#8220;I see what you&#8217;re doing and the only thing that prevented me from coming out to you was that I feared it may become a prescribed obligatory duty.&#8221; And that was in Ramadan. (Sunan al-Nasa&#8217;i al-Kubra)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The Prophet (saw) loved to pray Taraweeh in congregation alongside his Companions but he feared it would turn into an obligatory prayer so he avoided it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what was the condition of the people when it comes to these night prayers during those times? To learn this, we quote the early renowned scholar Shihab-ul-Din al-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">قال ابن شهاب فتوفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم والأمر على ذلك ثم كان الأمر على ذلك في خلافة أبي بكر وصدرا من خلافة عمر بن الخطاب</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Al-Zuhri said: So the Prophet (saw) passed away and the condition was as such during the Caliphate of Abi Bakr and the first part of `Umar bin al-Khattab&#8217;s Caliphate. (Muwatta&#8217; Malik)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, people remained in that situation -some praying individually, others praying in congregation- inside the mosque until `Umar organized them in the Masjid. With this, we move to the main narration that gets the deviants riled up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">عن عبد الرحمن بن عبد القاري أنه قال خرجت مع عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه ليلة في رمضان إلى المسجد فإذا الناس أوزاع متفرقون يصلي الرجل لنفسه ويصلي الرجل فيصلي بصلاته الرهط فقال عمر إني أرى لو جمعت هؤلاء على قارئ واحد لكان أمثل ثم عزم فجمعهم على أبي بن كعب ثم خرجت معه ليلة أخرى والناس يصلون بصلاة قارئهم قال عمر نعم البدعة هذه والتي ينامون عنها أفضل من التي يقومون يريد آخر الليل وكان الناس يقومون أوله</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Ibn `Abdul-Qari said: I went out to the mosque with `Umar bin al-Khattab on a night from the nights of Ramadan. As we entered, we saw that the people were divided, some praying individually and others forming groups and leading people. Upon this, `Umar said: &#8220;If I united these folks behind a single reciter that would be best.&#8221; After deciding on this, he gathered them behind Ubay bin Ka`b. The next night, I went out with him while the people stood behind their reciter (i.e Ubay) so `Umar said: &#8220;A blessed innovation this is. However, those who sleep during it have done even better than those who stay up.&#8221; He means those who stay up to pray at the end of the night as opposed to those who stay up to pray at the beginning of the night. (Sahih Bukhari)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From this we learn:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- People were still praying the nights of Ramadan as individuals and groups as the Messenger (saw) left them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Caliph `Umar decided to organize the Muslims behind one Imam in Taraweeh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- Ubay bin Ka`b was the best Qur&#8217;anic reciter at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">D- `Umar was satisfied with this decision and thinks it&#8217;s better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">E- Praying the last part of the night is better than praying the first part of the night according to `Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">F- People were free to join the congregation or pray the night prayers separately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The issue arises when people read the expression &#8220;A blessed innovation this is.&#8221; They think that `Umar has committed a sin by innovating. Truth of the matter, is that as you clearly saw from previous reports, `Umar never innovated a new thing in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because the word &#8220;Bid`ah&#8221; can be used in its linguistic form or its technical scholarly form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example is the word Sahabi (companion), in its linguistic form it simply means a person who accompanies you on a journey or a person who spends a lot of time with you. Whereas in its scholarly technical form it means: &#8220;Any person who saw the Prophet (saw), embraced Islam and died upon it.&#8221; A big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example is the word Hadith (narration), in its linguistic form it simply means any story you narrate about anything. Whereas in its scholarly technical form it means: &#8220;Any words, actions or confirmations by the Prophet (saw).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, the word Bid`ah (innovation), in its linguistic form means any change whether good or bad, such as the Qur&#8217;an being printed on paper instead of animal skin like in the past. This simply makes accessing it and preserving it more convenient, it does not change the Qur&#8217;an&#8217;s nature, text or status. Whereas the technical term is referred to as &#8220;Ihdaath&#8221; or &#8220;Adding new religious tenets without precedent or subtracting from the religious tenets without excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When `Umar used it he simply meant &#8220;This is a blessed change&#8221; or &#8220;A change for the best&#8221; not that he added something to the religion or changed the tradition of night prayers that was previously established by Rasul-Allah (saw). Furthermore, `Umar is often praised for reviving this blessed tradition since after the seal of prophet-hood there was no chance of it becoming obligatory duty because revelation ended (which was the only reason the Messenger (saw) never did it regularly).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also seems from the narration, that `Umar believes it&#8217;s more rewarding to sleep after `Isha&#8217; and wake up to pray these same night prayers before Fajr. However, most people played it safe since there were no alarm clocks to wake you before Fajr Adhan so Taraweeh was most popular at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PART-III: WHAT DID `ALI BIN ABI TALIB THINK OF TARAWEEH?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LASTLY, what do we read concerning the opinion of `Ali bin abi Talib regarding the Taraweeh prayer?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْحَارِثِ الْخَرَّازُ ، قَالَ : ثنا سِنَانُ بْنُ حَاتِمٍ ، قثنا جَعْفَرُ بْنُ سُلَيْمَانَ ، قثنا حُبَابٌ الْقُطَعِيُّ ، عَنْ أَبِي إِسْحَاقَ الْهَمْدَانِيِّ ، قَالَ : خَرَجَ عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ فِي أَوَّلِ لَيْلَةٍ مِنْ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ وَالْقَنَادِيلُ تُزْهِرُ ، وَكِتَابُ اللَّهِ يُتْلَى فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ ، فَقَالَ : نَوَّرَ اللَّهُ لَكَ يَا عُمَرُ ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ فِي قَبْرِكَ ، كَمَا نَوَّرْتَ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ بِالْقُرْآنِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin al-Harith al-Kharraz told me: Sinan bin Hatim told us: Ja`far bin Sulayman told us: Hubab al-Quta`i told us: from abi Ishaq al-Hamdani, he said: `Ali bin abi Talib went out on the first night of Ramadan while lanterns were glowing and God&#8217;s Book was recited in the mosques (during Taraweeh). `Ali then supplicated: &#8220;May Allah fill your grave with light O `Umar bin al-Khattab as you&#8217;ve lit God&#8217;s houses with the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; (Fada&#8217;il-Ramadan li Ibn abi al-Duniya)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ مَخْلَدٍ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو الْعَبَّاسِ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنِ يُونُسَ السَّرَّاجُ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ يَعْنِي ابْنَ رَبِيعَةَ قَالَ : حَدَّثَنَا خَالِدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ الْوَاسِطِيُّ , عَنْ حُصَيْنِ بْنِ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ , عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ السُّلَمِيِّ قَالَ : أَمَّنَا عَلِيُّ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ فِي قِيَامِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ قَالَ : وَمَرَّ بِبَعْضِ مَسَاجِدِ أَهْلِ الْكُوفَةِ , وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ الْقِيَامَ فَقَالَ : نَوَّرَ اللَّهُ قَبْرَكَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ كَمَا نَوَّرْتَ مَسَاجِدَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[We were told by Ibn Makhlad: abu al-`Abbas Muhammad bin `Abdul-Rahman bin Yunus al-Sarraj told us: `Abdullah bin Muhammad ibn Rabi`ah told us: Khalid bin `Abdullah al-Wasiti told us: from Hosayn bin `Abdul-Rahman, from abi `Abdul-Rahman al-Sulami who said: We were led in prayer in one of the mosques of Kufah by `Ali bin abi Talib during the night prayers of Ramadan. As `Ali passed by some of the mosques of the people of Kufah as they performed their night prayers he said: &#8220;May Allah fill your grave with light O `Umar bin al-Khattab as you&#8217;ve lit our mosques.&#8221; (Shari`ah lil-Ajurri)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ أَبِي الْحَارِثِ , بِبَابِ الشَّامِ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا عُبَيْدُ بْنُ إِسْحَاقَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنَا سَيْفُ بْنُ عُمَرَ قَالَ: حَدَّثَنِي سَعْدُ بْنُ طَرِيفٍ , عَنِ الْأَصْبَغِ بْنِ نُبَاتَةَ قَالَ: قَالَ عَلِيُّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: &#8221; لَأَنَا حَرَّضْتُ عُمَرَ رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ , وَرَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ عَلَى قِيَامِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ , أَخْبَرْتُهُ أَنَّ فَوْقَ السَّمَاءِ السَّابِعَةِ حَظِيرَةً؛ يُقَالُ لَهَا: حَظِيرَةُ الْقُدُسِ , فِيهَا قَوْمٌ يُقَالُ لَهُمُ: الرُّوحُ , فَإِذَا جَاءَتْ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ اسْتَأْذَنُوا رَبَّهُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِي النُّزُولِ إِلَى الدُّنْيَا , فَلَا يَمُرُّونَ بِأَحَدٍ يُصَلِّي , أَوْ يَسْتَقْبِلُونَهُ فِي طَرِيقٍ إِلَّا أَصَابَهُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ بَرَكَةٌ قَالَ: فَقَالَ عُمَرُ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: إِذَنْ , وَاللَّهِ يَا أَبَا الْحَسَنِ , نَعْرِضُ النَّاسَ لِلْبَرَكَةِ , فَأَمَرَهُمْ بِالْقِيَامِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Muhammad bin abi Harith told us in Bab-ul-Sham: `Ubaydullah bin Ishaq told us: Sayf bin `Umar told us: Sa`d bin Tarif told us: from al-Asbagh bin Nubatah: `Ali bin abi Talib said: &#8220;I pushed `Umar may God have mercy on him to encourage the night prayers during the month of Ramadan, I told him that above the seventh sky is a garden called al-Quds and its dwellers are spirits; Whenever the night of Qadr came they take permission of their Lord to descend into the world. Every time they pass by a person praying he gets blessings.&#8221; `Umar responded: &#8220;If so, O aba al-Hasan, let us expose the people to these blessings.&#8221; He then told them to pray the night. (Al-Ibanah li Ibn Battah)]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May God reward those who establish Taraweeh.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article we will give a simple summary of all the correct beliefs that have reached us authentically regarding Imam Mahdi based on the well-researched work of the scholar Dr. `Abdul-`Alim `Abdul-`Adhim al-Bistawi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The topic of Imam Mahdi although not mentioned in God&#8217;s Book is a topic that the commoners love to speak of. Story-tellers found it really easy to narrate wonderful tales and weird stories in order to appeal to the masses. The stories were later attributed to God&#8217;s Messenger (saw), the noble Companions, the pious followers and even to the people of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this study, we will rely on the popular books of the scholars of Islam. We will dismiss all reports that do not contain a chain of transmission, such as those that begin with &#8220;It has been narrated that&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;We were told that&#8230;&#8221; because relying on hear-say has no place in a respectable academic study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will also ignore the books of the Shia sects who are obsessed with the &#8220;Awaited Imam Mahdi&#8221; or &#8220;12th Imam&#8221; as they call him. This is because they claim to have received special knowledge from certain descendants of `Ali bin abi Talib which they have collected in secret documents. This claim is very dubious and highly un-academic, what makes this more suspicious is the vast amount of self-contradicting stories and unbelievable tales contained in their printed books that cannot be found anywhere else nor does it have a basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The author of this book went through hundreds of narrations in the main books of the Muslims while looking into the authenticity and weakness for each and every report. The result as one can read in his book and as you can see below is that out of the hundreds of narrations, only a handful are authentic and they are very subtle without much detail. This shows that the majority of what&#8217;s spread among laypeople are fantasies and myths without much truth to them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">I- Meaning of &#8220;Mahdi&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Arabic word Mahdi comes from the root &#8220;Huda&#8221; which means guidance and thus al-Mahdi simply means &#8220;The guided one&#8221;. The belief in the Mahdi or the concept of a Mahdi is referred to as &#8220;al-Mahdawiyyah&#8221; and it is a technical scholarly term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The word was used in many narrations and reports, in an authentic report `Isa (as) is described as being &#8220;Imaman Mahdiyyan&#8221; or a &#8220;guided leader&#8221;. In another, the righteous Caliphs are described by the Messenger (saw) as &#8220;Rashidin Mahdiyyin&#8221; or &#8220;The rightly guided successors after me.&#8221; In some authentic narrations the Prophet (saw) supplicates God to make his Companion abi Salamah from the same status as &#8220;al-Mahdiyyin&#8221; or &#8220;The guided ones&#8221;. In other authentic report, he (saw) supplicates for his Companion Jarir bin `Abdullah that &#8220;O Lord make him steady and turn him to a guided guide&#8221; or &#8220;Hadiyan Mahdiyya&#8221; a very similar supplication was made for Mu`awiyah bin abi Sufiyan. In another authentic narration the Prophet (saw) made supplication for himself and the entire nation: &#8220;O Lord, bestow upon us the beauty of faith and make us all guided guides.&#8221; among many other locations in prophetic-narrations and poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sense, the prophetic prophesy is simply stating that at the end of times, there will emerge &#8220;al-Mahdi&#8221; or a &#8220;Guided leader.&#8221; This is not his name, rather it is his title and a description of his conduct and actions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">II- Different positions regarding Imam Mahdi in this nation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are four groups and we list them from majority to minority:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- Those who believe in the coming of a guided leader who precedes `Isa (as) and leads the nation before his advent.  He shall be born at the end of times and is called &#8220;Muhammad bin `Abdullah&#8221;. This group is the vast majority of Muslims and their evidence is a large amount of prophetic narrations a few of which are authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- Those who believe the guided leader is already born and call him &#8220;Muhammad bin al-Hasan&#8221;, they attribute to him miraculous powers, divine knowledge and infallibility. They believe he has been walking among us for more than a thousand years in disguise so no one may recognize him. This group is the Twelver Shia sect who claims to possess secret knowledge from the prophetic-household.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- Those who believe that the guided leader at the end of times is none other than `Isa (as) himself. They weaken the narrations that state otherwise and rely on an authentic report declaring that `Isa (as) will be a guided (Mahdi) leader at the end of times. This is supported by some reports attributed to a few of the early followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">D- Those who disbelieve in the awaited guided leader and the second coming of `Isa (as) and view these as foreign beliefs that are harmful to Islam as it causes laziness and places false hopes in a mythical character that will never show up. This view has not much support and is adopted by a small minority most of which are Qur&#8217;anists.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">III- The beliefs Muslims must hold concerning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A-Beliefs we learned through authentic explicit narrations that clearly speak of Imam Mahdi:</h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>He is from the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) household, from Fatimah&#8217;s progeny.</li>
<li>His name will be Muhammad bin `Abdillah.</li>
<li>He has a high forehead and a distinctively thin and slightly curved nose.</li>
<li>God will prepare and rectify him in one night.</li>
<li>A person will be killed if he even mentions the name of God before his time.</li>
<li>He will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression.</li>
<li>When three leaders fight for a treasure his army will appear from the east.</li>

<li>`Isa (as) refuses to lead the nation in prayer to honor them.</li>
<li>`Isa (as) defeats the Dajjal and remains among them for forty years.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">B-Beliefs we learned through authentic but vague reports that seem to be referring to Imam Mahdi:</h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>There will be a sign in sunrise.</li>
<li>He may receive the pledge between al-Rukn wal-Maqam.</li>
<li>He may be one of the twelve Caliphs that succeed the Prophet (saw).</li>
<li>He may be the one to seek refuge in the Ka`bah while his opponents will be swallowed by the earth.</li>
<li>A Syrian army that opposes him will be weakened by severe weather.</li>
<li>He fights a Syrian army with an army of his own composed of three groups.</li>
<li>His army&#8217;s slogan will be &#8220;death, death&#8221; and they number between twelve and fifteen thousand.</li>
<li>When God honors him with guidance, he will still be young.</li>
<li>He shall easily become a leader.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>NOTE: If you read anything other than the above concerning &#8220;Imam Mahdi&#8221;, know that it is taken from unreliable weak reports or fabricated stories. Only the above details are what we know through the popular authentic narrations.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">IV- Reliable prophetic-narrations explicitly mentioning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- `Ali narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is from my household, God will rectify him in one night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- `Abdullah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;When you see the black flags emerging from the land of Khurasan, go and seek them for among them is God&#8217;s successor, the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;Towards the end of my nation shall emerge the guided one. God will bless him with rain so that the earth will bring forth its fruits; he will divide money justly and cattle will increase. He shall live around seven or eight years.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is of my lineage. He has a high forehead and a distinctively thin and slightly curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with tyranny and oppression, and he will rule for seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Aba Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;In my nation shall be a guided man. No matter how long he lives he shall spend seven, eight or nine years filling the earth with justice and equity. The earth will bring forth its plants and the sky will send down its rain.&#8221; In some narrations we read an addition: &#8220;At that time, my nation will live a life unlike anything before it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Jabir narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;`Isa bin Mariyam (as) will descend so their guided leader will say: &#8216;Come lead us in prayer!&#8217; However, `Isa (as) replies: &#8216;No, this nation will be led (in prayer) by one of their own. This is how God honors them.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This shows how `Isa (as) declines the offer of our guided leader to be the leader of prayer and informs them that only people from Muhammad&#8217;s (saw) nation may lead each other.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Thawban narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;Near this treasure of yours, three will engage one another in combat. Each of them the son of a successor (leader). But it will not reach any of them. Then the black flags will come from the East, and they will kill you in a way unlike any nation before.&#8221; And he (saw) mentioned something I couldn&#8217;t memorize, then said: &#8220;If you ever hear of him then seek him, even if you have to crawl on snow, for verily he is God&#8217;s successor, the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Umm Salamah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The guided one is from my progeny; from Fatimah&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">V- Reliable reports from the Companions and Followers explicitly mentioning Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Ibn al-Hanafiyyah narrates: We were with `Ali when a man asked him about the guided one. So, `Ali replied while signaling with seven fingers: &#8220;This is way far! That one will come out at the End of Time. (At that time) if a man said, &#8216;Allah! Allah!&#8217; he will be killed. Then, God the Most High will gather together a group around him, just as the separate pieces of cloud are joined together. God will unite their hearts. They do not need anyone nor will they rejoice if one joins them. Their number matches that of the people at Badr. The past Generations will not surpass them and the latter generations will not reach up to them. Their number will also be that of the companions of Talut who crossed the river with him.&#8221; Ibn al-Hanafiyyah asked Abu al-Tufay (the narrator): &#8220;Do you seek him?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: &#8220;He emerges from between these two mountains (meaning Makkah).&#8221; Abu al-Tufayl replied: &#8220;I shall not leave it (Makkah) till I die.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The beginning of the report portrays the state of corruption the world has reached, that even saying God&#8217;s name can get you killed. Then it describes the followers of the guided leader, they shall be around three hundred men just like the army of Badr. The last part discusses where this leader originates from.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Sa`id bin Jubayr narrates: Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;Three men come from our household: The blood shedder (al-Saffah), the triumphant (al-Mansur) and the guided (al-Mahdi).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Ibn `Abbas is talking about the children of Hashim but this narration can also be understood that Imam Mahdi is from al-`Abbas&#8217;s progeny. This is most likely why one of the `Abbasid Caliphs adopted the title &#8220;Mahdi&#8221; to boost his claim to the throne.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Mujahid narrates: A man from the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) Companions said: &#8220;The guided one shall not emerge before the pure soul (Nafs-ul-Zakiyyah) is killed. When the pure soul is killed, they shall incur the wrath of he who is in the sky and in the earth shall. The guided shall emerge and they (believers) will celebrate around him just like a bride&#8217;s family celebrates on her wedding night; he will fill the earth with justice and equity; earth will bring forth its plants; the sky will send down its rain and my nation will be blessed during his reign like never before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The pure soul is also the title of a revolutionary from al-Hasan bin `Ali&#8217;s progeny. Be warned however, many political leaders and personalities intentionally adopt titles like these to enforce their political position and claim that they are prophesied.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Salim bin abi al-Ja`d narrates: `Abdullah bin `Amr said: &#8220;O people of Kufah, you will be the happiest with regards to the guided one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Most likely because he is from Hashim&#8217;s progeny and Kufah was politically aligned with Hashemites so `Abdullah assumed they&#8217;d be the happiest when Imam Mahdi appears.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Hisham narrates: Muhammad bin Sirin said: &#8220;The guided one is from this nation and he is the one to lead `Isa bin Mariyam (i.e in prayer).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Ibn Tawus narrates: `Ali bin `Abdullah bin `Abbas said: &#8220;The guided one shall not emerge until the sun rises with a sign.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: A very vague report.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Ibrahim narrates: I asked Tawus: &#8220;Is `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz the guided one?&#8221; He responded: &#8220;`Umar was guided but he is not that guided one (from the end of times). When he comes, the good-doer will be rewarded and the evil-doer will be forgiven. He spends the money, is strict on the governors and merciful towards the poor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Qatadah narrates: I asked Sa`id bin al-Musayyib: &#8220;Is the guided one true?&#8221; He said: &#8220;He&#8217;s true.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;From whom?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Quraysh.&#8221; I said: &#8220;From which?&#8221; He said: &#8220;From Hashim&#8217;s children.&#8221; I said: &#8220;Which ones?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Children of `Abdul-Muttalib.&#8221; I asked further and he said: &#8220;From Fatimah&#8217;s progeny.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9- Ibn Shawdhab narrates: Matir said: We heard that the guided one will accomplish things greater even than `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz. A beggar comes and asks him so he says &#8220;Enter the treasury and take what you wish.&#8221; After doing so, as he exits, he sees all people are full and satisfied so he feels regret and proceeds to return the money but is told: &#8220;We give and never take.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10- `Imran narrates: al-Samit (or Shamit) said: &#8220;His name is that of a prophet; he will be fifty one or fifty two; he rules for seven or eight years.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VI- Reliable prophetic-narrations referring to Imam Mahdi vaguely</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- `Ali narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;If only a single day&#8217;s worth remains of time (on this earth), God will send a man from my household who will fill it with justice as it was filled with oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- `Abdullah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;If only one day remains of this world, God will stretch that day until a man from my progeny whose name matches mine and his father&#8217;s name matches my father&#8217;s name is sent to you (i.e Arabs).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This means his name is Muhammad bin `Abdullah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;How will you (i.e Arabs) be if `Isa bin Mariyam (as) descends while your leader is one of you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: We know from other authentic reports that the leader at the time will be Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said that if only one night remains of this world then a man from his household will assume authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;A man will receive a pledge of allegiance between the corner of the black-stone and the station of Ibrahim (as). None shall degrade the sanctity of the House (i.e Ka`bah) except its own people; when they do so then doom shall befall the Arabs. The Abyssinians (i.e Africans) will then come and destroy it permanently, extract its treasure and it shall never be rebuilt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This is most likely not discussing Imam Mahdi as it is known that in his time there will be peace and prosperity.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The hour shall not come to pass until the earth is filled with oppression and tyranny, then a man from my progeny shall rise and fill it with justice and equity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The man whom `Isa bin Mariyam (as) prays behind is from my progeny.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8- Abu Sa`id narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;From among the successors who will lead you is one who will distribute wealth generously without counting.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9- Jabir bin Samurah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;The people&#8217;s affairs will continue to be conducted well as long as they&#8217;re ruled by twelve chiefs.&#8221; Then he spoke a word I did not understand so I asked my father and he said: &#8220;All of them, from Quraysh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: A lot of people associate this report with Imam Mahdi. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that this is referring to Imam Mahdi as can be reviewed in our article <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/12/hadith-of-twelve-caliphs/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10- Umm Salamah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;A man will seek refuge in the House (i.e Ka`bah) so they will send an expedition after him but when they reach a certain desert land, they shall be swallowed by the earth.&#8221; I asked: &#8220;O Prophet (saw), what about those who were forced to join?&#8221; He (saw) replied: &#8220;They will be swallowed but then each man is judged on his intentions.&#8221; The narrator said: &#8220;It is the desert of Madinah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The above text may or may not be referring to Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11- Abu Hurayrah narrates: The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;God&#8217;s spirit, `Isa bin Mariyam (as) shall descend so recognize him when you see him. He is a man of medium height, with a radiant complexion leaning towards white; he will be between (or dressed in) two slightly yellowish garments; His head looks as if it is dripping water even though it is not wet. He will break the Cross, kill the swine and abolish Jizyah (tax on Christians and Jews); he shall call them towards Islam and the Dajjal will perish in his time so peace will befall the people of earth. Lions will be with camels, tigers with cows, wolves with sheep and even children will play with snakes unharmed. He will stay in the World for forty years. Then, he will die and the Muslims will perform the funeral prayer for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: Imam Mahdi will rule them for seven years until `Isa (as) descends, then it seems authority will be transferred to `Isa (as) the prophet who rules for forty years and defeats Dajjal.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VII- Reliable reports from the Companions and Followers vaguely referring to Imam Mahdi</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1- Ibn Zurayr narrates: `Ali said: &#8220;There will be tribulations in which people will become as (few as) the gold in the minerals; so do not verbally abuse the people of al-Sham except their oppressors for among them are the substitutes (i.e Abdal). God will send down on them torment from the sky which will divide and weaken them to the extent that foxes could (easily) defeat them. At that point, God will send forth a man from the Messenger&#8217;s (saw) progeny alongside twelve thousand supporters at least or fifteen thousand at most. Their slogan will be &#8216;Death, death&#8217; and they shall be composed of three divisions. Facing them, will be seven divisions, each will be led by one who is desirous of authority yet they shall be defeated by the Hashemite and God will return for them peace and blessing until the appearance of the Dajjal.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The &#8220;Abdal&#8221; are extremely pious people that are prophesied to appear in al-Sham one after the other, as if each is substituting the other. This appears to be a battle against an army during the reign of Imam Mahdi.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2- Abu Ma`bad narrates: Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;Days and nights shall not pass until a young one from our household attains authority; he will not be overcome by tribulations.&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O `Abbas, your elders were unable to achieve this (high status) yet your youngsters attain it?&#8221; He said: &#8220;It is God&#8217;s affair and decision. Just as He began it with us He shall end it with us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3- `Awf narrates: Ibn Sirin said: &#8220;In our nation will be a successor who is even superior to Abu Bakr and `Umar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: This is the opinion of Muhammad bin Sirin and the scholars disagree with this odd opinion. Some give this statement the same interpretation as the narration which states that people will come after the Sahabah who are better since they believed without seeing the Prophet (saw).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4- Ibn Sirin narrates: Abi al-Jald said: &#8220;He acquires authority easily from inside his house.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">VIII- Conclusion to research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A- The guided leader, Imam Mahdi, is truth and should not be denied due to the presence of a number of Sahih and Hasan narrations as well as plenty of weak ones that support the existence of this character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B- The amount of weak and fabricated reports is astonishing. It seems plenty of folks decided to create stories concerning this prophesied figure and attribute them to the Prophet (saw) and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">C- The belief in a guided leader that emerges at the end of times is simply a sign of the hour. No emphasis was given to this matter in Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah and thus it is not of much importance in the daily lives of Muslims.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding Imamate in the Early Shia Society</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The following article takes an in-depth look at aspects of Imamate in light of the understanding displayed by early Shia society. The time period that is placed under the microscope is the pre-Ghaybah era in which early Shias flocked in search of their Imams. The article aims to debunk myths about Imamate and to display to readers the sort of confusion that early Shias found themselves when it came to identifying the Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We will only be using <u>authentic</u> narrations from Shia sources in this article.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Number of Imams</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Timing of Appointments</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Secrecy of the Imamate</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?</strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Number of Imams</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first misconception that we will find many Shias falling into is the assumption that Shias were known as Twelvers early on. Though, those that are familiar with the splits among the Shia communities of old, will be aware that this was not the case at all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The early Shias were known as Al-Qat’eeyah. They are those that affirmed that Musa Al-Kathim passed away, unlike many other Shias that disagreed and believed that he was still alive. The name Al-Qat’eeyah was recorded in the books of Sa’ad bin Abdullah Al-Asha’ri and Al-Nawbakhti (p. 86) and was also recorded by Sunnis historians like Al-Malti (Al-Tanbeeh p. 26), Abu Hasan Al-Ash’ari (Maqalaat p. 34), and Al-Shihristani (Al-Milal p. 111).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The name Al-Qat’eeyah came into being after the passing of Musa Al-Kathim in the year 183 AH.  This suggests that the name: Itha Ashariyya, is a very late name. It is not possible to suggest that they were known as Twelvers before Musa Al-Kathim, since if that was the case, there wouldn’t be a reason for a name change in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By returning to specific narrations, we find that the Qat’eeyah themselves clearly did not know how many Imams there would be. Abu Jareer Al-Qummi asks Al-Redha if his father Al-Kathim went into Ghaibah, suggesting that he did not believe that the Imams were twelve, but they could have been seven. (Al-Kulayni 1/237)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In another narration, Ayoub bin Nuh, one of the close companions of Al-Redha, after seeing that people have all pledged their allegiance to Al-Redha, came to the assumption that he was the Mahdi. (Al-Kulayni 1/210)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, the very suggestion that the Mahdi is the seventh or eighth Imam shows that early Shias were not familiar with the belief that the Imams had to be twelve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another aspect that should be taken into consideration is that according to early Shia narrations, the Mahdi should have come much earlier, way before the time of the twelfth Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Baqir said, “Allah had deemed the year 70 as the time, but when Al-Hussain was killed He was so angered that He delayed it until the year 140. When we told you of this, you spread it the secret, and so Allah kept the time away from us.” (Al-Kulayni 1/229)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ja’afar Al-Sadiq said, “The time was going to come in the year 140, but we spoke of this to you, and you have spread this, so Allah delayed it.” (Al-Nu’mani p. 303)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The previous two narrations are clear that the “time” was going to come way before the appointment of all twelve of the Imams. So it makes no sense that the Shias would be referred to as Twelvers in the first place.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Timing of Appointments </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It goes without saying that if the number of the Imams weren’t known, it is only natural to believe that their identities weren’t known either. There are several cases in which we find some of the top companions of the Imams being completely unaware of who the next Imam was. This is clear evidence that the full list of who the Imams were was not known to anyone. According to a lengthy narration, the Prophet – peace be upon him – made it known who some of Ahlulbayt were (i.e. Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain), but did not list all the Imams. (Al-Kafi 1/172)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first and most straightforward evidence that affirms this is that whole list of Imams was not available to the Imams themselves was that Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, in two separate narrations, says that the Imam does not pass away until Allah tells him who the next Imam will be. (Al-Kulayni 1/166) The narration is clear that this information was not privy to him from the start of the Imamate, but rather, it becomes known to him towards the end of his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is even clearer in the narration of Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar, in which Ja’afar Al-Sadiq tells him to accept Musa Al-Kathim as his next Imam, and that Ja’afar was ordered by Allah to not tell anyone before Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar. (Al-Kulayni 1/188)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We also find that Ali Al-Hadi when asked about who the next Imam was, he told his student, Isma’eel bin Mihran, to not fear for his safety. Years later, when asked again, he said, “Now you may fear for my safety, the matter (of Imamate) is to my son Ali.” (Al-Kulayni 1/198)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another fact that needs to be taken into consideration is that some of the top students of the Imams were not aware of the whole list of Imams. Not only that but some of them were not aware of who the Imam of their time was.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Zurarah bin A’ayan, the top Shia scholar during the time of Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, according to Al-Najashi (p. 175), did not know the identity of the next Imam. When Ja’afar died, his son Abdullah sat in his position and started to teach the Shias. Zurarah then sent his son Ubaid in order to find out who the Imam was. Zurarah passed away before accepting Musa bin Ja’afar as the Imam. (See Al-Kashshi p. 117)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">A similar scenario is that of Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Fadhal, who died in the year 224 AH. According to a narration, he accepted Al-Kathim while upon his deathbed. When asked about his allegiance to Abdullah bin Ja’afar, who Ibn Fadhal previous assumed was the Imam, he said, “We looked in the books and found nothing about Abdullah.” (Rijal Al-Kashshi p. 400) It is important to note that Ibn Fadhal, who was considered to be one of the most pious Shias of his time, spent his whole life following a false Imam without evidence, nor was he aware of the appointment of Al-Kathim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Salim bin Abi Hafsa, a Zaidi, asked Abu Ubaida Al-Hatha’ who his Imam was, Abu Ubaida answered, “My Imams are the Aal of Mohammad.” Salim responded, “I see that you do not know your Imam.” (See Al-Kashshi p. 172)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In an even stranger narration, Hanan bin Sadeer asked Al-Baqir if Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah was an Imam. (Ali bin Babawaih p. 193) This narration suggests that even followers of the Imams were not necessarily aware of the identities of the previous Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though it is common knowledge that the Imamate is inherited through direct descendants, during the 3<sup>rd</sup> century, we find that Mohammad bin Isma’eel bin Bazee’ asked Al-Redha as to whether the successor of the Imam can be an uncle or a brother, which means that he wasn’t even aware that Imamate was exclusive to sons. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 191)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very important to be aware that the Twelver community of the fourth century was aware of the ignorance of the early Shias, which caused some of them to completely reject the notion that there are clear textual evidences for the appointment. (Al-Khazzaz p. 61)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is very important to keep in mind that the Imams did not share the full list of Imams. When asked, they would either not provide them with the name of their successor, or they would only mention the name of the very next Imam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Ja’afar Al-Sadiq gives instructions to Abdula’ala bin A’yan, the brother of Zurarah, of the procedures to identifying the Imam when the previous Imam passes away. Al-Sadiq, instead of providing him with a list of names of the Imams, provides him with the procedures. (Al-Kulayni 1/236) The same occurs with Mohammad bin Muslim Al-Thaqafi, one of Ja’afar’s closest companions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 225)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, as explained in another <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/01/07/identifying-infallible-imam/">article</a>, the Imams often provided their followers with signs, instead of a list of whom the successive Imams were going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another example is when Ja’afar Al-Sadiq was asked by Nasr bin Qaboos about who the next Imam was, he said that it would be Musa Al-Kathim. Then, when Musa was asked, Nasr asked him, and he said it would be Al-Redha. (Al-Kashshi p.322) Neither Al-Sadiq nor Al-Kathim provided Nasr with a list of Imams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It should also be known that those that accepted the Imams of their times do not show any knowledge of who the next succeeding Imams are going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Amr bin Huraith for instance, meets up with Ja’afar Al-Sadiq, and lists out his beliefs. He then mentions his acceptance of the six Imams. Ja’afar does not fill him in on the rest of the Imams, but rather, confirms his statements. (Al-Kashshi p. 299)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The same occurs with Mansoor bin Hazim (Al-Kashishi p. 301), Khalid Al-Bajali (Al-Kashshi p. 302), and Al-Hasan bin Ziyad (Al-Kashshi p. 303).</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Secrecy of the Imamate</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another matter that led to the confusion surrounding the Imamate of the Imams was that their lives were enshrouded in secrecy. The Imams was very secretive in nature. There are even cases in which the Imams would tell their students not to teach of their Imamate. This led to the ignorance of their students in regards to the identities of the Imams and the appointment of their successors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When asked about his Imamate, Ja’afar Al-Sadiq completely denies that he is an Imam when approached by two Zaidi men. They then tell him that they heard this from some of pious followers in Al-Kufa. Al-Sadiq continued to deny it. (Al-Kulayni 1/138  / Al-Kashshi p. 305)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one report, Hisham bin Salim met a man from Bani Makhzoom in Madinah. They discussed the topic of Imamate, so the man asked, “Who is the Imam today?” He replied, “Ja’afar bin Mohammad <em>alaihi al-salam</em>.” He said, “By Allah, I will tell him!” Hisham reported that he was filled with fear upon hearing this and was afraid that the Imam would rebuke him or cast him away. (Al-Kashshi p. 200)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy involved in the Shiasm of the Imams was so deep, that the Imams would intentionally teach their own Shia followers from Iraq conflicting knowledge. (Al-Kulayni 1/39)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At times, the secrecy was so great that the Imams would not share knowledge with their followers in front of their very own children. This occurred between Ja’afar Al-Sadiq and his son Abdullah when Abu Al-Baseer asked him questions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 210)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy was so severe that even the <strong>children of the Imams</strong> were genuinely not aware of these appointments ever being made.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah, the son of Ali bin Abi Talib, said to his nephew, “Your father did not appoint an Imam.” (Al-Kulayni 1/215)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In a clearer narration, Zaid bin Ali, in a conversation with Abu Ja’afar Al-Ahwal about Imamate, claimed that he never heard such a thing from his father Zain Al-Abideen. He refuted Abu Ja’afar Al-Ahwal by saying, “My father used to make the hot food warm out of pity for me, are you suggesting that he didn’t have any pity over me going to hell?!” (Al-Kulayni 1/100)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The secrecy that surrounded the Imams prevented the message of Imamate to spread. At one point, in Makkah, only four people accepted the message of Imamate during the time of Al-Baqir. (Al-Kashshi p. 179)  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In a <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/01/07/identifying-infallible-imam/">previous article</a>, we have listed the methods as to how one would determine who the next Imam would be. However, upon investigation, we found that these methods were not always used.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hisham bin Salim, instead of seeking evidence for an appointment, resorted to testing Abdullah bin Ja’afar as the Imam by questioning him in basic arithmetic. Upon failing the test, he rejected Abdullah’s claim to Imamate. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 209) The very fact that Hisham had to resort to this makes it clear that he and his companions never heard of an appointment from Ja’afar for his son Musa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, as we have previously mentioned above, Ibn Fadhal accepted Abdullah as an Imam without hearing of an appointment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In one strange case, Al-Husain bin Omar, tells Al-Redha that he will accept him as an Imam simply because Al-Redha made that claim. He affirms that he did not hear of Al-Kathim making an appointment. He states that he will complain to Allah on the Day of Judgment if Al-Redha turned out to be a false Imam the same way his father will complain to Allah about Musa Al-Kathim, since he was initially a follower of Abdullah the brother of Musa. (Al-Kashshi p. 305)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the methods of finding out who the appointed Imam was is through the “weapon”, for the Imam is the one that inherits the weapon of the Prophet – peace be upon him – according to some narrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The sons of Abi Al-Sammal respond to Al-Kathim by saying, “Who knows the weapon anyhow?!” (Al-Kashshi p. 338)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, the point they brought up is a fair one, for it was not possible for one to arrive at a conclusion as to whether an artifact was owned by the Prophet – peace be upon him – simply by looking at it.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">From the above, we have established that early Imamis did not believe that the Imams were twelve, nor were they aware of their identities. At best, they were only notified during the time of the current Imam. This opposes the commonly held view that the companions of the Imams had full lists of who the Imams were going to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, even with the overwhelming <strong>authentic</strong> evidence that we have provided, some stubborn Shias may still insist that the identity of the Twelve Imams were always known.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Generally, they will provide two arguments for this.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">They will usually quote the hadith of Jabir bin Samura, which is found in the Saheehain, which suggests that the caliphs are twelve.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">There are other narrations that contain the number of the Imams, while other include the full list of the Imams. These narrations clearly contradict the narrations that are provided in this article.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Our response is as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The existence of this Sunni narration did not faze any other early Shia sect that disagreed over the number of the Imams. Not only is Jabir bin Samura not reliable according to Shias, but Shiasm does not rely upon Sunni hadiths to establish its own views. Moreover, as we have proved earlier, the Twelvers themselves did not identify themselves with that name, but were known as Al-Qat’eeya.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Note: For a complete refutation of the Hadith of the Twelve Caliphs, please refer to this <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2015/05/12/hadith-of-twelve-caliphs">article</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In response to the second point, firstly, for the sake of clarity, we shall refer to narrations that affirm the Imamate of the Twelve by name or number as (Set B), while referring to the narrations that have been quoted in our article above as (Set A). It is not reasonable for any person that respects their own intellect to prefer Set B over Set A for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For starters, it is historically accurate that Shias often differed in the numbers of the Imams. This is an irrefutable fact that is attested to by early historians. If Set B was accurate, then these sects wouldn’t have existed in the first place. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, Twelvers would have been known as Twelvers, and not Al-Qat’eeya.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even the most famous narration that suggests that all the Imams were known – the narration of Abu Hashim Al-Ja’afar &#8211; was doubted by Mohammad bin Yahya Al-Attar, the teacher of Al-Kulayni. He commented, “I wish this narration came from the path of someone other than Ahmad bin Abi Abdullah, suggesting that it contradicts what is commonly known about the ambiguity of the Imamate. (Al-Kulayni 1/337)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In some cases, a narration from Set A, would be transformed into a Set B narration. For example, a narration in Al-Kafi 3/211 contains a supplication taught by Musa Al-Kathim which refers to the Imams without mentioning their names. However, the same exact narration can be found in Al-Saduq’s Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh p. 158 with an addition of the explicit naming of all twelve Imams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below we have included some of our favorite examples of fabrications in order to open the eyes of the doubting Shias:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication that Omar, Uthman, and A’isha Narrated Hadiths of Twelve Imams</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 167) that Omar said: The Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – said: “…my household are from the children of Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, Al-Hussain, and nine grand Imams from the children of Al-Hussain, they are my <em>itra</em> from my flesh and blood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 169) that Uthman said: I heard the Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – say: “The Imams after me are twelve, nine of them are from the progeny of Al-Hussain…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 289) that A’isha said, that the Prophet – peace be upon him and his household – heard Jibreel list out the names of each of the Imams, one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is needless to say that <strong>none</strong> of these narrations are authentic in Sunni nor Shia standards. However, it just shows the lengths taken by these fabricators. Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi goes on to narrate such narrations from over twenty companions. However, we have hand-picked the above since they are seen by Shias as enemies of Ali. This shows that the fabrications are even more unbelievable since these “enemies” would never narrate such a thing since it would be used against them and their rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Leader of Jaroodiyya Zaidism</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Another example that is worth mentioning is what Al-Kulayni has narrated in Al-Kafi 1/342 from the path of Abu Al-Jarood from Al-Baqir from Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, that he saw Fatima with the whole list of the names of the twelve Imams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, this goes against the teachings of Abu Al-Jarood himself. Abu Al-Jarood is Ziyad bin Al-Munthir, to whom the Jaroodiyya Zaidi sect ascribes to. Al-Nawbakhti, when describing the teachings of the sect in his Firaq Al-Shia p. 31-32 affirms that the sect does not believe in the appointment of any of the Imams except for the first three. It also doesn’t specify the number of Imams and believes that there can be more than one Imam at one time. It should be noted that Abu Jarood never believed in Al-Baqir or Al-Sadiq as Imams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Main Scholars of the Waqifi Sect</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Waqifi sect believed in seven Imams, with Musa Al-Kathim being the last of the Imams. However, that didn’t stop Twelvers from attributing narrations to them that affirmed all twelve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some fascinating examples of Waqifi scholars that have fallen victim to such attributions include the creator of the sect, like Ali bin Abi Hamza. (Al-Ghaybah by Al-Tusi p. 63-64) Not only does the fabrications affirm the name and the number “twelve”, but also includes that whoever rejects any of them is an unbeliever. (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Not surprisingly, if one were to return to Ali bin Ahmad Al-Musawi’s “Fi Nusrat Al-Waqifa” (via Al-Tusi’s Al-Ghaybah p. 55, 56, 60), one would find that Ali bin Abi Hamza actually taught that the Musa Al-Kathim is the final Imam and that he never died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other examples of this include Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Hamza (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Hanan bin Sadeer (Al-Khazzaz p. 329), Mohammad bin Al-Hasan bin Shammoun and Sama’a bin Mihran (Al-Kafi 1/343), who are all established figures in the sect.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, we are left with two scenarios in regards to the two sets of narrations, A and B. If Set B is authentic, then we must believe that the Imams hid away the names of the Imams from their closest companions and family members, while sharing this knowledge with their enemies who usurped the caliphate and created new sects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There shouldn’t be a shred of doubt left that Set A is the orthodox Shia stance, since it is clearly not as ideologically loaded as the narrations of Set B.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even though we have presented powerful authentic evidences from Shia sources themselves, we know that it is up to the readers to choose to open their hearts. Selective retention and a forced skimming through the text, instead of an open-minded study of the text, could cause one to shrug off even the strongest of arguments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The evidences for the lack of clarity and the chaos of everything Imamate in the first centuries cannot be denied. However, as the centuries passed the chaos subsided, which led to generation after generation of Shias that did not question what they were upon, nor to look into the chaos from which they came.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">May Allah guide the truth-seekers among the Shia to His true path.  </span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Identifying the Infallible Imam</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Convert to Shiasm (<em>and Shias that have been born into their sect but are open-minded enough to examine it</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to some error in judgment from your part, you have made the grave mistake into falling for polemical arguments in the form of Hadith <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/07/30/response-to-the-hadith-of-manzila/">Al-Manzilah</a>, <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2016/08/19/did-allah-remove-his-messengers-saw-fears-at-ghadir/">Ghadeer</a>, and <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2014/05/08/fadak-prophetic-inheritance-qa/">Fadak</a>, and you have made the decision to accept Shiasm. You claim that you are thorough in your research, but you will have to admit that you truly only accepted Twelver Shiasm because the majority of Shias today are Twelvers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You seem to be unaware that the acceptance of the “Twelve” has only become a “given” after Twelverism spread and became the predominant Shia sect. However, is predominance enough evidence for you?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> For the intelligent Shia reader we have compiled the actual list of evidences/conditions for the Imamate as per the instructions of the Imams themselves. The list is based on Al-Kulayni’s chapter in Al-Kafi entitled: Bab Al-Umoor alati Tujibu Hujjata Al-Imam (alayhim al-salam) 1/170-171.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3599 alignright" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4-150x150.jpg" alt="image-4" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-4-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3603 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6-150x150.jpg" alt="image-6" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-6-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The chapter consists of seven narrations, which are from Al-Baqir, Al-Sadiq, and Al-Redha. From these, Al-Majlisi graded the first five as reliable. The signs included are: The next Imam 1) is the eldest from among his brothers, 2) is honorable, 3) received a clear appointment from his predecessor, 4) has the weapon of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , 5) is the person who has the most rights to the previous Imam, 6) cannot be accused of lying, stealing, or fornication, 7) is of pure birth, 8) is brought up well, 9) and does not play around.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From these narrations, we will only be examining <strong>exclusive</strong> signs. We will be ignoring subjective/vague “signs” since they are shared by millions of people (i.e. being honorable, brought up well, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It is important to note that the failure of  the alleged Imam to display these signs nullifies their status as Imams.</strong></p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">Eldest from Among the Brothers</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Received a Clear Appointment from His Predecessor</li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eldest from Among the Brothers</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3602 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5-150x150.jpg" alt="image-5" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-5-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The sign of being the eldest from among the brothers led to great confusion a few decades after Al-Redha passed away. The reason being that the 11<sup>th</sup> Imam is not the eldest from among his siblings, rather, his brother; Mohammad Abu Ja’afar was the eldest. Al-Nawbakhti states in his Firaq Al-Shia (p. 96) that a schism was created among the followers of Al-Hadi. Not only was Mohammad the eldest, but his followers claimed that they heard his father appoint him as the next Imam. When news arrived of his death, they denied it, and claimed that he was the Mahdi, hence, rejecting the conc ept that the Imams need to be Twelve. This group was known as Al-Mohammadiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Tusi narrates in his Kitab Al-Ghaybah (p. 82-83) that Abu Hashim Al-Ja’afari was with Al-Hadi when his son Mohammad Abu Ja’afar died. He states that Mohammad Abu Ja’afar died after being appointed by Al-Hadi, though, Allah then revealed that Al-Askari is to be the Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is explicit proof of the inaccuracy of Al-Redha’s sign/prophecy or that Al-Hasan Al-Askari is a false Imam.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received a Clear Appointment from His Predecessor</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the list that has been provided, there has not been a weaker piece of evidence than the “clear appointment”. Al-Redha states in Al-Kafi 1/170 that if one were to enter a town and ask, “Who was appointed as successor,” he would be told. This suggests that the appointment was so clear, that the news was widely available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, anyone who knows history could clearly see that this never occurred. Rather, ambiguity surrounded the identity of the Imams. Not only were the signs ambiguous, but there was a lot of disunity due to the lack of any clear appointments within Shia circles themselves. It goes without saying that none of these appointments can be found within Sunni texts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Firaq Al-Shia by Al-Nawbakhti (p. 92-109), we find that upon the death of Al-Redha, his followers split into two sects. One followed his brother; Ahmad bin Musa, while another stopped believing in any other Imams, and started to believe that Musa Al-Kathim was the Mahdi. Those are known as the Waqifah. As for those that followed Al-Jawad, some of them followed his son Musa bin Mohammad before accepted Ali Al-Hadi. Not too long after, Ali Al-Hadi’s followers accepted his son Ja’afar bin Ali as the next Imam instead of Al-Hasan Al-Askari. Soon after, after the death of Al-Hasan Al-Askari, the Shias split into thirteen different sects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>:</strong> We have only briefly discussed the confusion after Al-Redha without delving into the confusing period of the earlier Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3598 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3-150x150.jpg" alt="image-3" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>It should also be known that not only was there a lack of a clear appointment, but the Imam would at times deny that he was the Imam. In the authentic tradition in Al-Kafi 1/138, Ja’afar Al-Sadiq was approached by two Zaydi men that asked if it was mandatory for them to follow him. He explicitly denied that he is to be followed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Keeper of the Weapon </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> “The Weapon” which is mentioned in the hadith is understood to be referring to Thu Al-Fiqar. The argument that can be made against this “sign” is the lack of evidence thereof. There are not enough evidences in the narrations to even suggest that each of the Imams had Thu Al-Fiqar. Only through circular reasoning could someone arrive at this conclusion with the pre-conception of their Imamate being established in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The usage of this “sign” as evidence is also problematic since the narrations don’t even include the companions of the Imams ever seeing Thu Al-Fiqar. With this in mind, how the sword even be used as proof for Imamate?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly, Al-Asma’ee relates that he did <strong>see </strong>Thu Al-Fiqar with Haroon Al-Rasheed. This narration, which has no political motivation, can be found in Tareekh Al-Tabari 4/1593.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Imam Cannot be Accused</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3604 alignleft" src="http://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409-150x150.jpg" alt="409" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/409-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The narration by Ja’afar Al-Sadiq states that the Imams cannot be accused of lying, stealing, or fornication. This “sign” is flawed since Ja’afar Al-Sadiq was himself accused by the Batris and the followers of Sulaiman bin Jareer of lying. Those who were once companions of Ja’afar Al-Sadiq eventually adopted the views of the accusers. See Al-Nawbakhti p. 76-77.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the Prophet – peace be upon him – was accused of lying by Quraish (see Surat Saad: 1-4), so it simply makes no sense that the Imams could not being accused due to some alleged divine protection against accusations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ultimate Proof against the Belief that All Twelve were Known</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very fact that the Imams are being asked for signs, instead of the names of their successors, is clear proof that they were never told of their identities. The first narration alone is through Ibn Abi Nasr, who is one of Al-Redha’s closest companions. (See Fihrist Al-Tusi p. 47) More importantly, the Imams do not respond to them by listing out the names of the remaining Imams, instead they provided them with “signs”. So, Al-Redha, instead of saying, “Mohammad, then Ali, then Al-Hasan, then finally Mohammad,” provided the fragile “signs” that clearly demonstrate the falsehood of the Twelver belief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One should also keep in mind that some of the schisms mentioned above, like the Waqifah and Al-Mohammadiyyah, do not follow twelve Imams, but chose a different number, which suggests that the belief that the Imams are twelve in number is one that was not held by several early Shia sects.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, there is no way for one to determine the identities of the Imams. Twelvers are captives of their own conjecture after accepting Shiasm. If modern Shias were more thorough in their search for truth, they would not jump on the Twelver bandwagon. Instead, they would carefully examine the evidences for each of the Imams…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…before ultimately rejecting them due to the lack of evidence for their Imamate.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">12 Reasons to Leave Shiasm</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, a brother asked for recommendations of a book or an online article that provides readers an outline of the dangers of Shiasm. The dangers, due to the problems in the foundations, are too many to count, due to the simple fact that Shiasm is not from Allah – subhanahu wa ta’ala &#8211; . However, much of what was written pertaining to this subject, especially in the English language, was not by experts in the field. It was with this in mind that I decided to provide our dear readers with a list of some of the most significant problems with Shiasm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without further adieu, I decided to stick to twelve reasons to leave the Twelver faith. May Allah – subhanahu wa ta’ala – guide all those that read it to the authentic Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A Pure Focus on Allah the Almighty</li>
<li>Access to the Hadith of the Noble Prophet</li>
<li>Acceptance of the Companions of the Noble Prophet</li>
<li>Access to the Real Teachings of Ahlubayt</li>
<li>Uniformity in the Teachings of Ahlulbayt</li>
<li>A <em>Taqiyyah-</em>free Ahlulbayt</li>
<li>Access to the Context of Qur’anic Verses</li>
<li>Reliable Books of Tafseer</li>
<li>Access to the Prophetic’s Biography</li>
<li>Trust in the Hadith Compilers</li>
<li>A Karbala Narrative that Makes Sense</li>
<li>Disbelief in a Twelfth Imam that has been hidden for over a Thousand Years</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1- A Pure Focus on Allah the Almighty</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main reasons for the conversion of ex-Shias to Sunnism is the focus on Allah – subhanahu wa ta’ala &#8211; . As many are aware, the main focus in Shiasm is not the Creator, but rather, the creation. Even though Sunnis venerate Ahlulbayt deeply, they do not make them the focus of their religion. This can be observed in their practices, lectures, and in their daily spoken language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias, sadly, do not enjoy the same focus on Allah. This is most commonly observed in how they encourage putting Ahlulbayt, as an intermediary, between them and Allah. This is not encouraged in the Qur’an, for we know that Allah – subhanahu wa ta’ala – said [2:186]: “And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2- Access to the Hadith of the Noble Prophet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people are aware that Sunnis build their faith on the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; . However, what most Shias are not aware of is the fact that there are not enough prophetic narrations in the Shia hadith corpus for them to build their sect upon, so the same cannot be said for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/10/12-reasons-leave-shiasm/kutubhadeethsittah/" rel="attachment wp-att-3519 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3519 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-150x150.jpg" alt="kutubhadeethsittah" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah-184x184.jpg 184w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KutubHadeethSittah.jpg 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>For prophetic narrations, the Sunnis have a variety of sources that they can refer to. Off the top of my head, Sunnis can easily find prophetic narrations in the Saheehain, the four Sunan, Musnad Ahmad, Muwatta Malik, Al-Tabarani’s three Ma’ajim, Sunan Al-Daraqutni, Sunan Al-Darimi, Saheeh Ibn Hibban, Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah, Musnad Al-Bazzar, Musnad Abi Ya’la, as well as the Masaneed that have been preserved through Ibn Hajar’s Al-Matalib Al-Aliya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias, on the other hand, do not have a book that collects prophetic traditions. When the odd prophetic narration is found in a book like Al-Kafi, or another one of the four books, it is weak due to the anonymity of a narrator 9 out of 10 times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should not be a surprise that the Shias do not have a large number of reliable prophetic hadiths, since they reject the majority of the companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him – as reliable narrators. This leads us to our next point.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3- Acceptance of the Companions of the Noble Prophet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though this may seem trivial to average Shias, it is clearly a matter of great significance as we can see from the previous point. The rejecting of companions ultimately leads to rejecting the vast majority of the prophetic traditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias may attempt to cling at straws by suggesting that the Sunni prophetic tradition is actually the result of Umayyad hadith factories. This theory is based upon a lack of an objective reading of the Sunni texts, since the majority of the Sunni prophetic traditions <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/12/31/yazeed-war-people-madinah-makkah/">do not contain anything pro-Umayyad</a>. On the other hand, the narrations about the merits of Ali and the rest of Ahlulbayt are plenty in number in Sunni books. More importantly, the vast majority of the Sunni traditions revolve around neutral practices and wisdoms from the Prophet – peace be upon him – . By neutral, we mean non-controversial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Acceptance of the Companions also leads to access to a plethora of their personal opinions in rulings and practices, as well as Qur’anic interpretation. These opinions are not binding upon Sunnis, since the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/06/02/adalat-al-sahaba/" rel="external nofollow">Companions were not infallible</a>. However, access to the opinions of first generation of Muslims provides Sunnis with a better understanding of religious matters that have some vagueness due to language and historical context.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4- Access to the Real Teachings of Ahlubayt</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very suggestion may come as a shocker to most Shias, however, Sunnis do claim that they are the preservers of the teachings of Ahlulbayt as well. In brief, there is no doubt that both Sunni and Shias are selective with what they narrate. The most obvious example of this is that Ahlulbayt are on good terms with the companions in Sunni narrations. In Shia narrations, we find that they are foes. At times, the Shia Imams are found <a href="http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/09/15/lanat/">cursing</a> the three caliphs and other companions as bitter enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One may ask: How do you know that it was the Sunnis that were successful in recording the teachings of Ahlulbayt?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, we would like to make Shias aware that matters are not as simple as a Sunni and Shia version of Ahlulbayt. Rather, we are dealing with the narrators that represent each sect. The Shia narrators from Ahlulbayt are from the city of Kufa like Zurarah, Abu Al-Baseer, and Mohammad bin Muslim. These are three of the top narrators who have attributed thousands of narrations to Ahlulbayt. Sunnis do not consider them to be reliable. Ironically, by looking into the earliest book of biographies (both Sunni and Shia), one can find some of the Imams cursing some of these men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another critical issue with the “Shia” version of Ahlulbayt is the sheer number of contradictions that have been attributed to the Imams, which leads us to our next point.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5- Uniformity in the Teachings of Ahlulbayt</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/10/12-reasons-leave-shiasm/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a8%d8%b5%d8%a7%d8%b1/" rel="attachment wp-att-3520 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3520 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/الاستبصار-150x150.jpg" alt="%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a8%d8%b5%d8%a7%d8%b1" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/الاستبصار-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/الاستبصار-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/الاستبصار-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/الاستبصار-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>It will come as no surprise to Shias that are well-read that the early Shia books of hadith are riddled with contradictions. Not only do the Twelve Imams contradict each other in almost every chapter of <em>fiqh</em>, but these contradictions can be found attributed to the Imam himself. Al-Tusi alone has collected four volumes of contradictions in his book Al-Istibsaar. Sunnis, on the other hand, have uniformity in their narrations from Ahlulbayt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main reason that Shias give for the massive amount of contradictions that can be found in their works is due to the <em>taqiyyah</em> of the Imams, which leads us to our next point.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">6- A <em>Taqiyyah-</em>free Ahlulbayt</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only is the true version of Ahlulbayt <em>taqiyyah</em>-free in Sunni books when it comes to their political actions and motives, but they are <em>taqiyyah</em>-free in their religious rulings as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to this, you will not find them providing false religious rulings in order to preserve their own lives or well-being. No, the Sunni Ahlulbayt do not compromise, nor do they let politics get in their way of teaching the religion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">7- Access to the Context of Qur’anic Verses</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shias are mostly unaware that specific issues in Qur’anic sciences (i.e. Chapters being Makki/Madani, abrogate in rulings, recitations, etc) are monopolized by Sunnis. These opinions can most be traced to the first century of Sunni scholarship. Ibn Abbas and his students played a major role in providing us with this wealth of information regarding context.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If Shias have any doubts in regards to this, then we suggest picking up a copy of Al-Tusi or Al-Tabrasi’s exegesis of the Qur’an in order for them to see the reliance of these top Shia scholar on early Sunni works. The same is applied to Ibn Mutawwaj’s Al-Nasikh wal Mansookh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same can be said about the actual reasons for revelation (Asbab Al-Nuzool) since no Shia classical works on the topic exist today.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">8- Reliable Books of Tafseer</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/10/12-reasons-leave-shiasm/2015-07-09_20-02-06/" rel="attachment wp-att-3521 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3521 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-07-09_20-02-06-150x150.jpg" alt="2015-07-09_20-02-06" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-07-09_20-02-06-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-07-09_20-02-06-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-07-09_20-02-06-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-07-09_20-02-06-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Tafseer Al-Ayyashi and Tafseer Al-Qummi are two books of <em>tafseer</em> that moderate Shias are not proud of. This is because these books are filled with opinions from the authors, supported by narrations from the Imams, that the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/07/24/authentic-shia-narration-declaring-the-corruption-of-the-quran/" rel="external nofollow">Qur’an has been tampered with</a>. We are very aware that moderate Shias do not accept such beliefs, which explains why they are not fond of these works in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunnis, on the other hand, are proud of their early books of <em>tafseer</em>. Tafseer Abdulrazzaq, Tafseer Ibn Abi Hatim, and Tafseer Al-Tabari, are three books of <em>tafseer</em> are works in which the authors’ primary focus was to provide readers with the earliest explanations of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; and the early generations.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">9- Access to the Prophetic’s Biography</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/10/12-reasons-leave-shiasm/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3522 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3522 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2-150x150.jpg" alt="acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/acf2a1d7-f878-4e82-a2c2-ab6ff9b205a2-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The average Shia is not aware that Shias do not have classical <em>seerah</em> books. Modern Shia <em>seerah</em> books are based upon the works of classical Sunni <em>seerah</em> works. This should not come as a surprise since specialization in <em>seerah</em> came from the middle of the second century. Examples include the works of Ibn Ishaq, which has been preserved through Ibn Hisham, and Musa bin Uqbah, which has been preserved by Al-Bayhaqi and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is due to the lack of prophetic content that contemporary Shia scholars don’t attempt to piece together a complete biography of the Prophet – peace be upon him – from Shia sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To summarize this point, by becoming a Sunni, you can actually have a complete idea of the life of the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , for it definitely included more than events like Al-Ghadeer, Al-Mubahala, and other events that revolved around Ahlulbayt.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">10- Trust in the Hadith Compilers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps one of the most overlooked differences between the sects is that Sunnis have the luxury of having complete trust in their own hadith compilers. It is important to be aware the trust is not blind. Rather, the trust exists for two reasons: 1) The abundance of sources and the 2) sufficient amount of biographical data about compilers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The abundance of sources ensures the reliability of the compilers. For example, there is not a single narration that can be found in Saheeh Al-Bukhari or Saheeh Muslim that cannot be found in another book of hadith. This is thanks to the abundance of the sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same cannot be said about Shia books, for Al-Kulayni and Al-Saduq, for instance, are the <strong>sole</strong> narrators of hundreds, if not thousands of narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of biographical data is self-explanatory. One does not need to look far in order to find a wealth of information about the lives of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, while one would struggle to find more than a paragraph about the lives of the top <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2014/06/02/shia-hadith-vs-sunni-hadith/" rel="external nofollow">Shia hadith</a> scholars like Al-Kulayni and Al-Saduq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">11- A Karbala Narrative that Makes Sense</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An ex-Shia brother said to me after reading some of our articles on <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/01/29/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales/" rel="external nofollow">Karbala</a> that the exaggerated fabrications about the events of Karbala were the first things that gave him doubts about Shiasm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you never quite bought the idea that <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/21/abu-fadl-al-abbas-quest-for-water-at-karbala/" rel="external nofollow">Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas</a> defeated over a hundred men after losing an arm in battle, then the Sunni narrative is for you. If you simply cannot accept that <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/10/20/muslim-bin-aqeel-case-study-fabrication-karbala-narrative/" rel="external nofollow">Muslim bin Aqeel</a> defeated 1,500 men single-handedly, then the Sunni narrative is for you. If you cannot stomach the idea that Al-Hussain willingly took his relatives, his infant son, and the children of Abdullah bin Ja’afar, to be knowingly slaughtered, then the <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/05/sunni-version-martyrdom-al-hussain/" rel="external nofollow">Sunni version is for you.</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">12- Disbelief in a Twelfth Imam that has been hidden for over a Thousand Years</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/2016/11/10/12-reasons-leave-shiasm/scan-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3523 external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3523 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scan-150x150.jpg" alt="scan" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scan-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scan-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scan-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Scan-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>If <strong>most</strong> Shias in the fourth century, according to Al-Saduq in the intro of his Ikmal Al-Deen, were having doubts about the Twelfth Hidden Imam, due to his “<strong>lengthy”</strong> absence, then how is it possible that this is not an issue today after over a thousand years without this alleged <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/05/10/issues-of-ghaybah/" rel="external nofollow">hidden</a> Imam?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is suggested by Shias that Allah – subhanahu wa ta’ala – would never leave the world without a <em>hujjah</em>. However, this <em>hujjah</em> has been out of action for so long that his existence in occultation simply does not have an effect on the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deep down, all religious Shias have these doubts and this is their chance to accept what they have always felt.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Karbala &#8211; the Facts and the Fairy-tales</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The martyrdom of Al-Hussain at Karbala has truly become a tale of epic proportions. It would not be an outrageous claim if one were to suggest that across the globe there is a continuous <em>matam </em>(seasonal mourning processions) event in which the story of Al-Hussain at Karbala is being told. The tragedy of Al-Hussain is a tragedy without a doubt, though, for the Shia, it is a tragedy for all the wrong reasons, for there is little doubt that Shias have no idea of what truly transpired at Karbala. Instead, they are fed with fairy-tales and fabrications that know no end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We request our Sunni readers to ask your Shia acquaintance to share with you the story of Karbala. There is little doubt that the zealous Shia will take this opportunity to share the tales that he has heard. Then, we request that you pop the most awkward question possible: Would you mind providing a source for this?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are certain that the Shia will have nothing more to say other than: 1) this is what we were told at the <em>matam</em>, 2) everyone knows this, or 3) my mom told me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shia has not yet realized the kind of predicament that he is in. This is because of their blind faith in those three “sources”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, most Shias have never read through a book about the martyrdom of Al-Hussain. Yes, they do have one lying on their shelf, but they have never attempted to read it. Instead, they’d rather “listen” to the events of Karbala at their gatherings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why would this be considered a dilemma though?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">We list out answers below in short and we will expand on them as we go along:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Twelver Shias have no Idea what their “Real” Sources are in Regards to Karbala</strong></li>
<li><strong>Statistics demonstrate Shia Manipulation of the Events of Karbala</strong></li>
<li><strong>One Single Twelver Shia Narration does have a Chain!</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Earliest “Shia” Sources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Popular Re-tellings of Al-Hussain’s Martyrdom Conflict with the Earliest Shia Version</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Hussain’s Reasons for  heading to Kufa</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Actions of Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas in Karbala</strong></li>
<li><strong>Did Al-Hussain save Islam? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Al-Hussain&#8217;s Final Advice to Sayeda Zainab</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Real Tragedy at Karbala</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1- Twelver Shias have no Idea what their “Real” Sources are in Regards to Karbala</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By sources, we mean books, or narrations, or texts. Receiving these narratives from parents or other family members is not sufficient. They simply weren’t there in the year 61 AH, nor were their grand-parents for that matter. The well-read English-speaking modern Shia, will most likely have picked up one of three books. &#8220;Nafsul Mahmoom&#8221; by Abbas Al-Qummi, &#8220;Maqtal Al-Hussain&#8221; by Al-Muqarram, or &#8220;A Probe into the History of Ashura&#8221; by Ibrahim Ayaati are<strong> the three most popular English books about Karbala.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, all three of these books are relatively modern, and can be considered to be contemporary works. A Probe into the History of Ashura is the weakest of the three. Originally, it was a collection of lectures about the lessons of Ashura, which was then collected as a book. Abbas Al-Qummi attempts to keep the analysis to a minimal. Al-Qummi focuses on actually providing the reader with the proper source material for what makes up the events of the battle of Karbala. Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram sticks to the middle path. Al-Muqarram provides both an analysis of events while providing a multitude of quotations from the earlier sources.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Source Material</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the source material, it is mainly based off four earlier works. They are Al-Irshaad by Al-Mufeed (413 AH), Ibn Shahrashoub’s (558 AH) Manaqib, Ibn Tawus’ (664 AH) Al-Lahoof, and Mohammad bin Abi Talib’s Tasliyat Al-Mujalis (10<sup>th</sup> century).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first two sources in the list are books that contain a lot of information about the twelve Imams, while the last two are specifically about Al-Hussain and his martyrdom in Karbala. Sadly, none of the four sources rely on chains of narrations. This is extremely problematic since the reader does not have the ability to judge which report is authentic. More importantly, none of these four men were at Karbala, nor were their parents or grandparents present. However, <em>shaikhs</em> at the <em>matam</em> today, feel obligated to preach what is found in these four books as if every single word was canon.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Solution</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the modern Shia preacher will not restrict themselves to what these four books contain without a doubt. Indeed, they will need to spice things up once in a while by providing their own exaggerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all cases, taking knowledge from sources that have been so disconnected from the reality of Karbala is hazardous. The status of Al-Hussain in the hearts of the Shia youth will allow for anything to flow in with the fabrications. This includes a corrupt ideology that has been entangled with the events of Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3000 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2-150x150.jpg" alt="Scan2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan2-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Ayatollah Mohammad Asif Muhsini describes this phenomenon by saying, “Most of the details of what occurred in Karbala are unknown, though the masses ask for what causes them to weep, and the preachers seek wealth and status, and this is what caused the current matter of the storytellers.” (Mashra’at Bihar Al-Anwar 2/156)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For further reading on this topic, be sure to check out <a href="http://twelvershia.net/2015/09/05/ashura-lies-and-fabrications/" rel="external nofollow">another one of our articles</a> on the topic of how Shia scholars accuse preachers at Hussainiyat of fabricating stories in order to appeal to their fanbase.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2- Statistics demonstrate Shia Manipulation of the Events of Karbala</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many ways for one to show how far Shia historians went in order to manipulate the events of Karbala to greater extremes. Below, we have included one set of statistics that display this fact. This was done when we compared the names of some of the companions of Al-Hussain and the number of those that they have killed during the battle of Karbala. To compile this little comparison, we relied on two sources: Al-Saduq’s (381 AH) Amali (p. 126-128) and Ibn Shahrashoub’s (558 AH) Manaqib (4/1006-1013). Notice that in a small time frame of two centuries, statistics have been distorted considerably over the coming centuries in favor of a more epic battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq in Al-Amali shows Al-Hurr bin Yazeed killing eighteen men (18), while Ibn Shahrashoub states that the number killed were “forty-something” (40+).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, Al-Saduq mentions that Habeeb bin Muthahir killed thirty-one men (31), while Ibn Shahrashoub mentions exactly twice as much as sixty-two (62).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Al-Saduq) mentions that Zuhair bin Al-Qayn killed nineteen men (19), while Ibn Shahrashoub adds a hundred and one more men to make the number: a hundred and twenty (120).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq mentions that Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel killed three (3), while Ibn Sharhashoub mentions that he killed ninety-eight (98)!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note, that is how disproportional things may get in a mere two hundred years. Imagine how bad has it gotten since then.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Children of Ali and Al-Hussain?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be noted that those that took part in Karbala that had names of the first three Caliphs were never given any attention. The sources mentioned earlier do refer to the participation of Abu Bakr bin Ali, Abu Bakr bin Al-Hussain, Omar bin Ali, and Uthman bin Ali, however, none of them were said to have killed anyone, with the exception of Omar bin Ali who killed one man according to one Shia narration. Perhaps it was their names that prevented the storytellers and fabricators from ascribing glorious feats to their names.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More fun facts from even earlier historians:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the early Shia historian Abu Mikhnaf (158 AH), only eighty-eight men (88) from Omar bin Sa’ad’s army were killed. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1053)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf also said that Omar bin Sa’ad’s army was four-thousand (4,000) men large. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1053)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibn Shahrashoub being a much later Shia author suggests that the number was thirty-five thousand (35,000) men!! (Manaqib Aal Abi Talib 4/1004)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3- One Single Twelver Shia Narration actually does have a Chain!<br />
</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the lack of a complete text that examines the events of Karbala from beginning to end, a contemporary by the name of Mohammad Jawad Al-Tabasi collected his &#8220;Maqtal Al-Husaini Al-Ma’thoor&#8221;, in which he built his book upon the traditions that have been attributed to the Imams directly. His effort was a solid one, though it was the lack of data that ultimately betrayed him, for there was only one narration in his book that provided any clear image of the events that transpired in Karbala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From his collection, the closest thing to a direct narration of the events of Karbala can be found in Amali Al-Saduq (381 AH). The narration is nine pages long. The modern Shia <em>matam</em> preacher will be saddened by how limiting nine pages must be, but alas, this is all that Shias really have to work with, if they wanted to be loyal to the text. Objectively, nine pages is by no means “small” narration, though, it is not long enough to fill the time slots at Hussainiyat <em>matams</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately for those that do not read Arabic, we are not interested in putting in the effort to translate fabrications. Indeed, this narration is a fabrication according to the standards of Ahlul-Sunnah and Shias alike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chain goes as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Saduq, from Mohammad bin Omar Al-Baghdaadi, from Abu Sa’eed Al-Hasan bin Uthman bin Ziyad Al-Tusturi, from Ibrahim bin Ubaidullah bin Musa bin Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq Al-Sabee’ee, from Mareesa bint Musa bin Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq, from Safiyya bint Yunus bin Abi Ishaaq, from Bahja bint Al-Harith bin Abdullah Al-Taghlabi, from Abdullah bin Mansour, from Ja’afar Al-Sadiq.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chain Criticism</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the narrators in this chain are anonymous according to both Sunni and Shia rijali standards. Sunnis go the extra mile by accusing Al-Hasan bin Uthman of being a liar. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan where Abu Ali Al-Nisapuri and Ibn Adi both accuse him of lying. Even the Shia scholar Ni’matullah Salihi reached the same conclusion about Al-Hasan bin Uthman. (See Al-Shaheed Al-Khalid p. 346)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Textual Criticism</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the narration itself is extremely problematic for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The narration mentions that Utba bin Abi Sufyan is appointed as governor of Madinah, when in reality, Utba died in the year 44AH according to Ibn Zabr Al-Rib’ee 1/143.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain leaves Madinah and heads directly to Iraq. This contradicts the established fact that he went to Makkah where he spent months there before leaving to Iraq.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ubaidullah bin Ziyad kills Sinan bin Anas, the killer of Al-Hussain, when Sinan brings in Al-Hussain’s head. This is illogical and goes against the established fact that Sinan was alive and stayed alive until the time of Al-Hajjaj. (See Al-Tabarani’s Mu’jam 2/704)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration provided by Al-Saduq does one thing differently though. It contains exaggerations that cannot be found in earlier sources that have been provided by Sunnis. These include visions by Al-Hussain, his certain knowledge of his martyrdom, and tales about how he killed people by supplicating against them. Even though the modern Shia may reject that these are exaggerations, one needs to keep in mind that it is only because they have been used to the exaggerated narratives every time they walk into a <em>matam</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4- The Earliest “Shia” Sources</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps there are two other sources that may be interpreted to be “Shia sources”. We use that word loosely since we hold the opinion that these two have nothing to do with the Imami narrative. The first of these is a narration by Mohammad Al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam. In this narration, his student, Ammar Al-Duhani asks him to narrate to him the events of Karbala “as if he could see it.” The narration itself is not too long either and it can exclusively be found in Sunni sources. Scholars that often quote this report do so through Tareekh Al-Tabari, though it can be found elsewhere. Of course, Shias often shun this narration simply because it comes through a Sunni source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunnis shouldn’t blame Shias though, since we feel the same way about their sources. Ironically, Sunnis themselves take this narration with a grain of salt because it comes through the path of a narrator named Khaled bin Yazeed Al-Qasri, who is extremely weak in his narrations. Some Sunnis have flat out rejected this narration for the same purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other source is perhaps the most important complete early source about the events of Karbala. Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya’s rendition of Maqtal Al-Hussain has always been the skeleton of the Karbala narrative. Fabricators often would keep his narration as the base, but then add onto it. This is very clear in the actual battle of Karbala if one were to compare Abu Mikhnaf’s narration and the late sources that have been mentioned above.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3002 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tusturi0002-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3001 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/al-salihi-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s Reliability</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to the reliability of Abu Mikhnaf’s tradition, Al-Tusturi, in his Mu’jam Al-Rijal 8/620 says that “his book Maqtal Al-Hussain (as), that is narrated by Al-Tabari and Abu Al-Faraj, is the most authentic <em>maqtal</em> (retelling of the death of Al-Hussain), for he narrates these events usually through one single intermediary.” Al-Najashi, similarly, when speaking about Abu Miknaf p. 320, says, “There is an acceptance to what he narrates.” Ayatullah Al-Salihi makes a very similar statement in his Al-Shaheed Al-Khalid (p. 39), where he argues that Al-Murtadha and Al-Tusi both relied on Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s version through Al-Tabari. Al-Salihi continues to build the case for Abu Mikhnaf by saying that he was a student of Ja&#8217;afar. All in all, the man is considered reliable by their standards&#8230; but does that he mean his narration is authentic as they claim?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf&#8217;s Teachers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, such statements are never satisfying to researchers, which is why we took it upon ourselves to list the teachers of Abu Mikhnaf in his Maqtal Al-Hussain, in order to see if his narrations are reliable according to Shia standards:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Narrators that are weak according to Al-Jawahiri:</h4>
<ol>

<h4>Others:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Mohammad bin Qais – There are many people with this name and Abu Mikhnaf was not clear about the entity of his teacher, therefore, we cannot comment on his status and cannot accept his report.</li>
<li>Abu Ali Al-Ansari – There is not enough information about this narrator to identify him or accept his report.</li>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see from the above, out of the forty-two teachers that Abu Mikhnaf has relied on, only two are reliable according to Shia standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the two narrations is by Abu Hamza Al-Thamali and it is about reactions to the death of Al-Hussain in Dimashq (Syria). Abu Mikhnaf narrates it from Abu Hamza, from Abdullah Al-Thamali, from Al-Qasim bin Bikheet. The latter two are both anonymous for they cannot be found in early Shia Rijal books.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">One Authentic Shia Narration</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That leaves us with one narration that could be considered authentic according to Shia standards. We are considerate of our choice of words too, since there are Shias scholars that may consider it weak since the path to Abu Mikhnaf is questionable. Regardless, we chose to translate in full. We have quoted it from Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1052:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3003 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-150x150.jpg" alt="Scan" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scan-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Abu Mikhnaf said: from Ja’afar bin Mohammad bin Ali:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Al-Hussain was killed, they found thirty-three stabs and thirty-four wounds. Sinan bin Anas used to forcefully approach anyone that would get near the body because he wanted to be the one that gets the head. He then did, and gave it to Khawli. Everything that was on Al-Hussain was taken. Bahr bin Ka’ab took his parts. Qais bin Al-Ash’ath took his cloak. Qais, then, became known as “The Cloak.” His sandals were taken by a Al-Aswad, a man from Bani Awd. His sword was taken by a man from Bani Nahshal bin Darim, and it reached Habeeb bin Budail at the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people came to his clothes, accessories, and camels, and they took all of it. The people came to the women, the booty, and his equipment, to the extent that a woman would fight over the clothes on her back until it was taken away from her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5- Popular Retellings of Al-Hussain’s Martyrdom Conflict with the Earliest Shia Versions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>a) Al-Hussain’s Reasons for  heading to Kufa </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one was to simply come across the events that led up to Karbala, one would have no doubt that Al-Hussain’s revolution was intercepted and quelled. His intention, as one can clearly see in the earliest reports, was to fill the land with justice and to politically reign over the nation. This also was the perfect time to do so since he had the support from the people of Kufa that he did not have when Mu&#8217;awiayh was in power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, according to the modern Shia interpretation, Al-Hussain knew that he was going to die by going to Kufa. In other words, he was sacrificing his own life for the sake of Islam. Twelvers hold this belief because it fits in with their ideology that the Imams know when they are going to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the staunchest supporters of this theory is <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram/al-husayn-s-prior-knowledge-his-martrydom" rel="external nofollow">Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram</a>. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">He made many such explicit and implicit statements in Medina, in Mecca, and on the way to Kufa, statements that you will read in this book in their entirety. They all testify that he (‘a), was fully aware of his being killed on the day with which he was familiar and in the land of Karbala’. So, can anyone doubt this fact if he reads his sermon in Mecca when he wanted to travel from there to Iraq? In that sermon, he said, “<em>I can see my limbs being cut to pieces by wild beasts in an area between al-Nawawees</em> <em>and Karbala’, so they will fill with my body empty stomachs and starved pouches;</em> there is no way to avert an event already decreed.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We beg to differ of course. There is no evidence that suggests that Al-Hussain knew of what was to come and there are too many evidences that suggest otherwise.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Response to Al-Muqarram</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are some points from the earliest version of the events of Karbala by Abu Mikhnaf:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When asked about where he wanted to go after fleeing Madinah, Abdullah bin Mutee’ asked Al-Hussain where he was heading to. Al-Hussain replied: Currently, I am going to Makkah, then I will make <em>istikhara</em> (a prayer in which one asks Allah for guidance when making a tough decisions) as to where to head off to next. He also mentions his intention of making <em>istikhara</em> to Ibn Abbas (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1012, 3/1025)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain writes a letter to the people of Kufa in which he states that he will send his cousin Muslim bin Aqeel to verify their need for him, and it is only then when he will make a move to Kufa. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1013)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Muslim bin Aqeel had no idea that Al-Hussain knew that he was marching towards his doom until the last moments in his life. If Muslim held previous knowledge, he wouldn’t have requested sending a warning to Al-Hussain. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1022)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain spent four months in Makkah (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1024). He had no reason to spend all that time in Makkah if his purpose was to get killed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain justifies his leaving towards Kufa because of the letters that he received (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1025)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain asks Al-Farazdaq about the status of the people of Kufa in order to learn if he can trust them. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1028)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain heads to Kufa with women and children from his family. This is not an action that one would take if one believed that they would be massacred. His intention was to arrive in Kufa, live in Kufa, and reign over it. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1029)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>One More Piece of Evidence</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of all the above, this is the most important narration that solidifies the view that Al-Hussain had no idea what he was getting himself into:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Mikhnaf states: As for what was told to me by Mujalid bin Sa’eed, Al-Saq’ab bin Zuhair Al-Asadi, and others of the traditionalists, and this is the view of the community of the traditionalists, is that he (Al-Hussain) said: Choose one out of three things for me: Either I go back from whence I came, or I put my hand in the hand of Yazeed and we settle this ourselves, or you send me to a Muslim border town and I live amongst them. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1036)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This statement speaks volumes, it shows that when al-Hussein faced the army of Omar bin Sa’ad he wished to settle things peacefully and return safely with his family. It suggests that Al-Hussain was not only having second thoughts, but changed his mind about the rebellion once he realized that he was outnumbered and that he was marching towards not only his death, but the massacre of his own family.</p>
<h3><strong>b) The Actions of Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas in Karbala</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to popular retellings today, there is no character that is blown out of proportion as Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas bin Ali bin Abi Talib. The tragic story of his death during battle has captured the hearts and minds of all Shias around the world, to the extent that Al-Abbas is referred to by the extreme Shia as Bab Al-Hawa’ij (The Door to Needs). Extreme Shias, sadly, ask him for their sustenance and have turned him into a godly figure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The modern Shia, when asked about Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas will tell you that the army of Omar bin Sa’ad prevented Al-Hussain and his companions, who were dying of thirst, from drinking from a water resource nearby. Al-Abbas, headed over to gather some water and was confronted by the army of Omar bin Sa’ad. Al-Abbas bravely challenged thousands of men, killing tens, if not hundreds, if not thousands, depending on who you ask. Then, Al-Abbas’ arm was cut off during the battle. However, he continued to fight. Then, his other arm was cut off. Al-Abbas continued to head towards Al-Hussain’s camp with the container of water clenched between his teeth, but alas, the army of Omar bin Sa’ad killed him before he could make it back. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtCHMX56CjA" rel="external nofollow">This scene</a> has been translated into film and is seen as an accurate representation of the events by the modern Shia.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Original Version?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the narration of Abu Mikhnaf, the earliest Shia version, conflicts with this version completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3004 alignleft" src="http://twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-150x150.jpg" alt="karbala" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-62x62.jpg 62w, https://www.twelvershia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karbala-184x184.jpg 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>First of all, Al-Abbas does not go to retrieve water alone, but is accompanied by thirty riders and twenty foot-soldiers. Furthermore, there is no mention of any casualties, with the exception of one of the companions of Amr bin Al-Hajjaj, from the army of Omar bin Sa’ad. He was stabbed by Nafi’ bin Hilal. The narration ends with Al-Abbas and Nafi’ succeeding in retrieving the water. Al-Abbas never has his arms cut off, nor is he portrayed as a one-man army. (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1036)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to be aware Al-Abbas is only mentioned in battle once more in the narration of Abu Mikhnaf (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1050) and there is no mention of any superhuman strength. He makes no other appearances or contributions.</p>
<h3><strong>c) Did Al-Hussain save Islam? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a question that Shias do not pose to themselves, even though it is often heard on pulpits that Al-Hussain’s rebellion saved Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The origin of this reasoning is the suggestion that Yazeed was so corrupt that his reign would lead to the complete destruction of Islam and the erasure of Shari’ah law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, such arguments cannot be supported with any evidence. Shias often attempt to provide narrations that suggest that Yazeed was a womaniser or a drunkard. However, neither sin is anywhere as severe as denying the Imamate of the Imam, let alone the usurpation of the position of the Imam. Hence, by Shia standards, Abu Bakr and Omar are infinitely worse than Yazeed, for the latter only came to power through inheritance, while Abu Bakr and Omar actively took Ali’s &#8220;divinely ordained rights&#8221;. In other words, Al-Hussain’s rise against Yazeed could not logically have anything to do with immoral behaviour by Yazeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we ask, how did Al-Hussain save the Shari’ah? Al-Hussain was not able take the reins of the nations from Yazeed, and eventually, a few years later, Yazeed died from natural causes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain’s rebellion did not cause a ripple in the ideology of the Muslims of the time, nor did it change the political situation. For the next ninety years, Bani Umayyah stayed in power. The rest of the Twelve Imams disappeared from the lime lights of early Islamic politics. It is not logical to conclude that Al-Hussain was politically victorious or that he was able to save Islam, nor was there anything special about Yazeed for one to assume that Islam was in a great new danger in the first place. The only victory for Al-Hussain is his martyrdom and the rewards that Allah will bestow upon him for  attaining that martyrdom.</p>
<h3><strong>d) Al-Hussain&#8217;s Final Advice to Sayeda Zainab</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the earliest narration by Abu Mikhnaf, when Al-Hussain realized that he was going to battle, he said to Sayeda Zainab: “O’ sister, do not break what I swore, for you shall not tear your pockets, scratch your face, or call for death upon yourself because of what becomes of me.” (Tareekh Al-Tabari 3/1039)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In modern times, <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram" rel="external nofollow">Abdulrazzaq Al-Muqarram</a> calls for the exact opposite. He says: “The things that remind people of al-Husayn (‘a), in their various methods, such as commemorative <em>majalis</em>, mournings, beating the cheeks at homes and in the streets&#8230;, help promote the sect.” He also provides late narrations to support this position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>6- The Real Tragedy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we have established two different accounts, examining the claims as to what makes a greater tragedy is necessary. As we have pointed out, the modern Shia position is that Al-Hussain knowingly sacrificed himself for the greater good. Not only that, but he sacrificed his family, by bringing them along with him to get sacrificed by the army.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary Shias like Al-Muqarram argue that Al-Hussain brought women with him as witnesses. Their role was to speak of what they saw, in order to expose Yazeed and his actions. Yet, this argument does not stand, for it cannot be applied to the children, like Abdullah the infant, as well as the children of Abdullah bin Jafa’ar bin Abi Talib, whom Al-Hussain brought along to be sacrificed along with him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni View</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sunni position states that Al-Hussain’s martyrdom was a tragedy due to the circumstances. The view held by Sunnis is supported by the earliest Shia position, as per the narration of Abu Mikhnaf,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hussain was enticed into joining the people of Kufa by the pleas of their people. Were it not for their pleas, he wouldn’t have been a victim. Continuing on, the people of Kufa ditched Al-Hussain out of fear for their own safety. Most importantly, as soon as Al-Hussain realized his predicament, he wishes for his safety and the safety of his family. He appeals to the religiosity of his opponents. Al-Hussain asks them to be sent to Yazeed directly, or to be left to go back from whence he came. However, the pride and tyranny of Umar bin Sa&#8217;ads army outweighed their humanity. Ultimately, they killed Al-Hussain, who did not wish for any bloodshed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hurr bin Yazeed puts it perfectly when he cries: “Don’t you accept from these men what they propose?! If the Turks and the Daylam requested this, it would have been impermissible to reject them!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is the tragedy and peace be upon al-Hussein our master.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">The Prohibition of Mutah Marriages</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The debate on the permissibility of <em>m</em><em>utah</em> marriages has spanned through centuries. The very act of indulging in a temporary marriage has triggered a multitude of emotional reactions from Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Much of the debate revolves around whether a temporary marriage is moral or not. It goes without saying that those that believe that it is prohibited usually hold the opinion that it is a despicable act. On the other hand, those who find it permissible voice the opinion that it is a necessity, since it prevents people from falling into other sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of studying the moral argument though, we at twelvershia.net decided that it would be more efficient to present to the dear viewer the academic answer and to avoid personal opinions. At the end of the day, it is Allah – praise be to Him &#8211; , that decides what is morally acceptable and what isn’t. The limited intellect of man has no place as a deciding factor when such is the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This set of articles will first establish the prohibition of <em>mutah</em> marriages through authentic Sunni hadiths. After this has been established, we will look into arguments brought forth by Shias in order to justify the practice of <em>mutah</em>, like the criticisms towards the hadiths in this chapter, the Qur’anic evidence, and other additional hadith evidences, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the beginning, during an expedition, Ibn Masu’d narrated (Muslim #3396): We were on a expedition with the Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him -, without any women. So we said, “Shall we castrate ourselves?” He forbade us from doing so, then permitted us to get married for a stipulated time, at the price of a garment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Hazimi in Al-I’itibar (p. 137) explains: This ruling was permissible in the early days of Islam and the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; , permitted it due to the reasons mentioned by Ibn Mas’ud, during their travels, and it is not known to us that the Prophet – peace be upon him &#8211; permitted it while they were in their homes, which is why he forbade them from practicing this more than once at different times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One interesting aspect from the narration is that Ibn Mas’ud points out that <em>mutah</em> became “permitted”. This implies that it was forbidden before the aforementioned expedition. This suggests that the companions knew of such a marriage, but that it was not made lawful to them until this occasion. Dr. Jawad Ali, the Shi’ee author of Al-Mufasal fi Tareekh Al-Arab Qabl Al-Islam suggests that <em>mutah</em> was practiced since pre-Islamic times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Contradiction about the Time in which Mutah was Banned?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the most common argument brought forth by Shias that support the lawfulness of <em>mutah</em> is the contradiction argument. A Shi’ee will usually argue that since the reports differ on the timing of the banning of <em>mutah</em> then we must completely reject all narrations that suggest that <em>mutah</em> was banned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response, we say that: It is not necessary for one to know the timing of when a religious ruling was made in order to accept it. One does not need to know when the prayers have been made obligatory, nor the alms, nor the pilgrimage, nor the fasting of Ramadan, nor the cutting off the hands of thieves, nor the time of the revelation of the inheritance laws for one to hold these matters as binding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No scholar would suggest that due to a difference of opinion as to the timing of the revealing of a law that it should be dismissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if a Shi’ee will obsessively suggest that this is a reason to reject a part of the <em>shari’ah</em>, then it is binding upon them to reject the imamate of Ali. When one returns to Shia sources, one find that Ali was first designated an Imam at different times. His appointment as an Imam occurred as early as the time he was a baby, then in a narration as soon as Mohammad – peace be upon him &#8211; became a prophet, then on Yawm Al-Dar, then on the night of the Isra’a, then during Mi’raj in the highest parts of the heavens, then on the way back to the earth, then on the night of the migration to Madinah, then after the 3<sup>rd</sup> year after Hijra, <strong>then on Khaibar</strong>, then on the<strong> conquest of Makkah</strong>, then during the day of the Ghadeer , then on his death bed. Sh. Faisal Noor, on more than one occasion mocks these narrations, since they often include a confused prophet asking the angel: Who is my successor? He comments that the Prophet – peace be upon him – had to be reminded of his successor occasion after occasion. (See pages 57-69 from Al-Imamah wal Nas by Sh. Faisal Noor).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reader can also look into the great conflict between all the narrations related to the 12th Imam of the Shia in the same book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The academic way of dealing with such contradictions is by filtering out weak narrations and by reconciling those that can be reconciled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the above in mind, we can take a look at the most important authentic narrations that include the timing of the prohibition of <em>mutah</em>, even though we can all agree that it is not necessary for one to know as to when the practice was made prohibited by the Prophet – peace be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narration about the earliest prohibition comes from the path of Ali bin Abi Talib in Saheeh Muslim #3417-3421. He narrates: The Messenger of Allah – peace be upon him – prohibited the <em>mutah</em> marriage of woman on Khaibar and consuming the (meat of the) domestic donkey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In some of these narrations, the words of Ali are directed towards Ibn Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second narration is the narration of Rabee’a bin Subra Al-Juhani from his father, in which he states that <em>mutah</em> was banned during the conquest of Makkah. This is also in Saheeh Muslim #3406, #3407, #3410, #3413, and #3414.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imam Muslim #3404 also includes from the hadith of Salama bin Al-Akwa’ that it was prohibited in the year of Awtas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to historians, the conquest of Khaibar occurred on the seventh year after Hijra, while the conquest of Makkah and Awtas occurred on the eighth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the narrations of Rabee’a bin Subra, like Al-Darimi’s in his Sunan #2250, suggest that it was during the final pilgrimage. However, one can safely conclude that this is a mistake by a narrator, since we find the same wording in Saheeh Muslim #3408 which also includes three of the same narrators. Therefore, it is safe to say that we are looking at the same hadith, but a narrator accidentally said that it was in the final pilgrimage, which occurred in Makkah, instead of conquest of Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Nu’aym Al-Haddad 3/19 adds: In the narration of Ja’afar bin Awn and Abu Nu’aym, both from Abdul Aziz bin Omar bin Abdul Aziz, from Al-Rabee’, the narrations point to this occurring during the final pilgrimage. As for the narration of Ibrahim bin Sa’eed from Abdul Malik bin Al-Rabee’, and the narration of Harmala bin Abdul Al-Aziz bin Al-Rabee’, and Al-Zuhri, from Al-Rabee’, it was on the conquest (of Makkah), and this is more correct.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Strongest Views about when Mutah was Prohibited</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this brief chapter, we will simply focus on presenting the case for the strongest views for when <em>mutah</em> was prohibited. We will not be concerned with opinions like Al-Hazimi’s (p. 137) that it occurred during the final pilgrimage, since we have established that it goes against the correct wording of the hadith of Subra Al-Juhani.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that in mind, we are left with two opinions, which are that <em>mutah</em> was prohibited during Khaibar, during the conquest of Makkah, or in both expeditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most popular opinion is the one that is often most echoed by Sunni scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Al-Nawawi states in Al-Minhaj 9/184 (via Al-Luma’ by Hamid bin Ali Al-Hanafi p. 50): The correct and chosen opinion is that it was made prohibited and permissible twice, and that it was permitted before Khaibar, then prohibited after Khaibar, then permitted before the conquest of Makkah, which is the day (year) of Awtas since they are connected, then made forbidden after three days permanently until the day of judgment, and the prohibition continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, this opinion was not agreed upon by all scholars. Al-Suhaili said in Al-Rawdh Al-Unuf 4/70 that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody from the historians nor hadith narrators are aware that <em>mutah</em> was forbidden on Khaibar, and Ibn Uyayna narrated it from Ibn Shihab from Abdullah bin Mohammad and said that the Prophet – peace be upon him – forbade the (meat of the) domestic donkey on the year of Khaibar, and (forbade) <em>mutah</em>. This means that <em>mutah</em> was made forbidden after this, or on another day, which means that it was a mix up in the wordings of Ibn Shihab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the earliest of sources &#8220;Musnad al-Hamidi&#8221; (d.219 AH) states the Hadith as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">حَدَّثنا سُفْيَانُ، قَالَ: حَدَّثنا الزُّهْرِيُّ، قَالَ: أَخْبَرَنِي حَسَنٌ، وَعَبْدُ اللَّهِ ابْنَا مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ، عَنْ أَبِيهِمَا، أَنَّ عَلِيًّا رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ، قَالَ لابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا: إِنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ &#8221; نَهَى عَنْ نِكَاحِ الْمُتْعَةِ، وَعَنْ لُحُومِ الْحُمُرِ الأَهْلِيَّةِ زَمَنَ خَيْبَرَ &#8220;، قَالَ سُفْيَانُ: يَعْنِى: أَنَّهُ نَهَى عَنْ لُحُومِ الأَهْلِيَّةِ زَمَنَ خَيْبَرَ، وَلا يَعْنِي نِكَاحَ الْمُتْعَةِ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[&#8220;The messenger (saw) forbade the mutah, and the meat of the domestic donkey on Khaybar.&#8221; Suffiyan says: Meaning, he (saw) forbade the donkey meat at the time of Khaybar but not the mutah of women.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abu Awana similarly comments 2/278:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scholars say that the meaning of hadith Ali bin Abi Talib is that “the Prophet – peace be upon him – forbade the eating of the meat of the domestic donkey on Khaibar AND forbade the <em>mutah</em> of women on the days of Al-Fath (conquest of Makkah).”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before going on, it is important to point out that the scholars above seemed to lean towards this view since it is rare for something to be permitted and prohibited twice in the <em>shari’ah</em>. They seem to have sided with the narration of Sabra instead of the narration of Ali due to the fact that it was also narrated that Salama bin Akwa’ also mentioned that it was prohibited on the same year. Furthermore, Sabra himself stated that he practiced <em>mutah</em> on those days and provided details about the events, which makes it unlikely that he could have provided an incorrect date. Due to this, some scholars interpreted the hadith of Ali to mean that <em>mutah</em> was banned in general while domestic donkey meat was banned on Khaibar. Even though we disagree with this opinion due to reasons that we will shortly point out, the opinions and conclusions that these scholars arrived to are rational ones, as opposed to Shia apologists who claim that since “contradictions” have occurred, it is obligatory to reject all the narrations that prohibit <em>mutah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, we have a few reasons to reject this opinion and stick to the view of the majority of the scholars of Ahl Al-Sunnah, which is that <em>mutah</em> was first prohibited on Khaibar, then made permissible and prohibited during the conquest of Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first reason is due to the hadith of Ibn Omar, in which he also mentions that <em>mutah</em> was banned in Khaibar. See Mustakhraj Abi Awana #3309.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second is that the reason provided by Al-Sulaihi is based on a chain that goes against what has been narrated by the majority. He quotes a narration that has Ali saying that “the <em>mutah</em> of women on Khaibar was prohibited,” and not “the <em>mutah </em>of woman, and prohibited the meat of the domestic donkey on Khaibar.” However, this narration contradicts the authentic narrations provided from Saheeh Muslim which are clear that it was banned on Khaibar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly, the narration in Saheeh Muslim from Sabra #3408/#3416 states that <em>mutah</em> is now banned until the Day of Judgment. With regular rulings in Islamic <em>fiqh</em>, laws are usually made without those attached words. For these to be binded with <em>mutah</em> suggests that <em>mutah</em> was made permissible before after prohibition, however, is finally banned permanently. The usage of this wording cannot be found in the hadiths describing <em>mutah</em> being banned on Khaibar.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As established in the previous texts, the authentic traditions from the Prophet – peace be upon him -, all point to the prohibition during his time. In this article we have covered the prohibition mentioned by Ali, Sabra, Ibn Omar, and Salama bin Al-Akwa’. In a separate article, we will also take a look at the narration of Omar, in which he also relates that the Prophet – peace be upon him – prohibited <em>mutah</em>.</p>
