					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2016/03/24/throne-of-allah-in-shia-hadiths/#comment-27390&quot;&gt;ali&lt;/a&gt;.

Brother, I wrote this article in order to prove to Shias that such narrations can be found in Shia books and are authentic to Shia standards. Narrations like these are not exclusive to Sunni hadiths. 

If you want to ignore or reject Shia hadiths then be my guest. Sorry, but I am not interested in having a discussion with someone who will reject their own authentic hadiths because their hadiths go against their preconceptions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you do not need to get into those Ahadith in order to make objection against Shias, bro!! the explicit words of Quran is enough when it says

the All-beneficent, settled on the Throne.( 20:5 )

but what we shia say is that how you should understand these Ayat and Ahadith?

let me know that when you talk to a baby how would you get him to know what you mean by Allah being everywhere? you may use the analogy of CCTV but does it exactly mean that Allah needs lens to watch and what so ever??

forget about the Shia method of understanding such Ahadith and let us know that how Allah whose being is not material is going to seat on the material throne?]]></description>
