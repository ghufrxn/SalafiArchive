They are copying from the book of an author, this author is a fraud and his books are deceitful. As for the chains, I didn&#039;t check them nor do I care but the first one for example from the book of Fadl bin Shadhan. first of all I seriously doubt this book is truly written by this man, a companion of an Imam would never write an entire book on the Mahdi if the Mahdi is supposed to be a secret, secondly that book states the Mahdi&#039;s mother is a Roman princess whereas another authentic Shia narration says she was a black slave girl. Overall, they have no science of Hadith to be able to claim something is authentic or not, their Rijali books themselves aren&#039;t reliable.]]></description>
