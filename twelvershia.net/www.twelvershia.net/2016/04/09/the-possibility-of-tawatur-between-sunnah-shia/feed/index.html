You can only establish &quot;mass-transmission&quot; via Sunni sources, as for the Shia they can&#039;t claim anything in their books is Mutawatir since they don&#039;t have many books. Ghadir may be Mutawatir in our sources not their sources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a layman and student of the  Deen, I must say that I lack any qualifications regarding Usul-i Fiqh, Kalam etc. However, in my limited understanding, I always thought that it has always been a rule that principles of Aqa&#039;id (Beliefs) must be supported by mutawwatir evidence and if the Shi&#039;a lack mutawwatir narrations of their own, then how do they substantiate their principles of Aqa&#039;id ? For example, if they encounter a principle such as the occultation of the 12th Imam, how do they substantiate that belief if it is not mentioned in the Qur&#039;an-i Kareem or a Mutawwatir hadith ? Am i wrong to say that matters of Aqa&#039;id must be substantiated by the clear text of the Qur&#039;an and Sunnah and upon those hadith that are well known i.e. Mutawwatir ? Someone please further elaborate if I am wrong, Jazakallahu Khayra ! After thought, the incident known as &quot;Ghaydir Khumm&quot; is a well known event and one reported by way of Mutawwatir hadith among our (Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jama&#039;at) hadith books of narrators despite the difference in it&#039;s Ta&#039;weel between the Sunni and the Shi&#039;a. However, do the Shi&#039;a not have their own narrators who narrate this event and if so, are not their narrations mutawwatir regarding this event ? I know that it is mutawwatir among our narrators. However, like I said, this incident has a completely different explanation for us i.e. Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama&#039;at.]]></description>
