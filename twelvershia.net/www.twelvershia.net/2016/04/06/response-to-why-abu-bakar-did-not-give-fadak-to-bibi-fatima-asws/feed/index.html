					<description><![CDATA[How ridiculous article!! So fatima(a), leader of Muslim women in jannah, daughter of the most pure human being on earth, wife of the &quot;city of knowledge&quot;, ((all according to sunni sources)), didn&#039;t knew what her father had left for her??Abu bakr knew???

Abu Bakr stated:

We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is to be given in charity.

and the word heir means: &quot;One who inherits “or “is legally entitled to inherit the property”(the American Dictionary - 2nd College Edition p324). Now, the very first statement goes against the facts since, historically it is admitted the holy Prophet (S) received inheritance from his father as as follows

Abdullah Ibn Abdul Muttalib left to Umme Aiman a legacy of five (5) dust coloured camels and a small flock of sheep, which was inherited by the Prophet of Allah.

Sunni references:

- Tabaqat Ibn Sad - Part I p39
- Siratun Nabi by Moulana Shibli Noumani, v1, p122
- Fath al Bari vol 3 p 360-361 (Mentions a house from Hashim, a sword, some goats and five (5) camels).
- Seerah al Halabiyah vol 1 p 56
- Ansab al Ashraf v 1 p 96

When the first part of the tradition is proved wrong, then how can the second part that is &quot;What we leave behind is to be given in charity&quot;, be true as well! This very statement also clearly violates the Verses that are stated in the Holy Qur’an, that are as follows:

&quot;And Solomon (Sulaymaan) inherited from David.”(Qur’an 27:16)

While both Sulaymaan and David were prophets and very wealthy. they were kings at their era. Allah , Exalted, also says:

&quot;(Zakariya prayed to Allah by saying) ... Grant me a son from yourself, who inherits from me andinherit from the children of Jacob, and make him, O’ my Lord, the one with whom you are well-pleased.”(Qur’an: 19:5-6).

These are examples that Prophets left inheritances, and as might you have seen that they seem to contradict the hadith that was narrated by Abu Bakr. So do you value Abu bakrs lie, or the Quran?The traditon mentioned by Abu Bakr is fabricated otherwise it would not contradict Qur’an. It was only reported by one man, who is Abu Bakr, himself. And, the Holy Qur’an stated a general rule concerning inheritance, where the Prophets and their heirs are included in this rule. ]]></description>
