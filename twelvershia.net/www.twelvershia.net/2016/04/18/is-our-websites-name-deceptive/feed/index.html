					<description><![CDATA[To illustrate my example about d-sunnah, look at the sunni forum of d-sunnah.net in 2005 :
http://web.archive.org/web/20050728004015/http://www.d-sunnah.net/forum/

And the shia version d-sunnah.org at the same year :
http://web.archive.org/web/20060401063122/http://www.d-sunnah.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2 

Same color, same structure of the forum, same place for others banners, etc...

Shia had even make an exact copy of the banner d-sunnah but modifying the text by adding &quot;quran&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol they dare to accuse sunni of misleading people with such names, they have forgotten that in their propaganda they always shia scholars with al-hanafi, al-shafi&#039;i to mislead sunnis.
