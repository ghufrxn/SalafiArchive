as the article mentions, it illustrates that even though iblees believes and knows with great certainty the truth, iblees does not act upon it, so both Abu Bakr r.a. and iblees believe in Allah with utmost certainty in that respect they are same, but the actions of the two are completely different, thus proper actions are important and mere belief is not enough]]></description>

They&#039;re all called &quot;Imaan&quot; in Arabic, according to Muslim sects and even Christians &quot;Imaan&quot; is different levels and some scholars will differentiate between the kinds of &quot;Imaan&quot; such as Imaan Tahqiqi, Imaan Mustawda`, Imaan Fitri, Imaan Mayyit etc... So a lot of scholars differentiate between the different types of &quot;belief&quot;. In English, some choose to differentiate between belief and faith.

As for why Iblees was chosen, it&#039;s because what Iblees witnessed in his life is far greater than what all other humans witnessed.]]></description>

I still didn&#039;t understand how Faith is different from Belief. Looking at your original article and your answer in comment section, correct me if I am wrong, I get the idea that you are saying Belief means to believe something without acting and Faith means to believe something with acting on it. 

For e.g. A person says if he jumps from a building GOD will save him but does not jump from the building to prove his claim as he is scared that GOD might not save him and he would die - this is Belief.

On the other hand, a person says if he jumps from a building GOD will save him and does jump from the building to prove his claim as he does believe that GOD will save him and not let him die - this is Faith.

Secondly, why would Abu Hanifa compare the Belief of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (r.a) with ibless? If by belief Abu Hanifa meant the belief in Existence of GOD then why not say that Belief of Hadhrat Abu Bakr (r.a) was like Belief of Nabi Musa (a.s) who was Kaleem-ULLAH or like Prophet Khidr (a.s)?

And lastly, could you let me know the Arabic word for the word &quot;Faith&quot; as the Arabic word for the word &quot;Belief&quot; is &quot;Emaan&quot; so that it could be easy to distinguish.]]></description>

Faith is more general than belief. I don&#039;t know about the narrations you speak of.

Iblees has solid belief in the existence of God because he spoke to Him. Abu Bakr&#039;s belief in God is like that of Iblees so it is as if He has absolute certainty and that is a great virtue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

I want to know what is difference between Faith and Belief? Aren&#039;t both the same thing?

Iblees according to some narrations (don&#039;t know about their authenticity) and bible wanted to become god. Didn&#039;t iblees know that there cannot be and never will be any god besides ALLAH (SWT).]]></description>
