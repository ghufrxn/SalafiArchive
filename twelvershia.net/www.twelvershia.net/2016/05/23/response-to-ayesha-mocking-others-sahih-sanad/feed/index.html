					<description><![CDATA[why do you keep deleting my posts? what are you trying to hide from people? well there are other incidents of Aisha backbiting and acting on backbiting also from your own sahih narrations. If i can show you more incidents then will that change your way of thinking or will you carry on with your brainwashed mindset?]]></description>

Actually it&#039;s your own ignorance that was exposed, what you quoted is the exact same incident and narration discussed in our article. I add, that we didn&#039;t say there aren&#039;t any, we said we didn&#039;t find any.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you said &quot; We do not find any other narrations in which A’isha backbites others, so one cannot say that this was her nature.&quot; why are you trying to deceive your readers by suggesting this was a one off incident?

Aisha did backbite on more than one occasion. here is just one example in abu dawud and this hadith is sahih according to albani:

حَدَّثَنَا مُسَدَّدٌ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى، عَنْ سُفْيَانَ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي عَلِيُّ بْنُ الأَقْمَرِ، عَنْ أَبِي حُذَيْفَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، قَالَتْ قُلْتُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم حَسْبُكَ مِنْ صَفِيَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا قَالَ غَيْرُ مُسَدَّدٍ تَعْنِي قَصِيرَةً ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏&quot;‏ لَقَدْ قُلْتِ كَلِمَةً لَوْ مُزِجَتْ بِمَاءِ الْبَحْرِ لَمَزَجَتْهُ ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏ قَالَتْ وَحَكَيْتُ لَهُ إِنْسَانًا فَقَالَ ‏&quot;‏ مَا أُحِبُّ أَنِّي حَكَيْتُ إِنْسَانًا وَأَنَّ لِي كَذَا وَكَذَا ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏

Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu&#039;minin: I said to the Prophet (ﷺ): It is enough for you in Safiyyah that she is such and such (the other version than Musaddad&#039;s has:) meaning that she was short-statured. He replied; You have said a word which would change the sea if it were mixed in it. She said: I imitated a man before him (out of disgrace). He said: I do not like that I imitate anyone even if I should get such and such.

so as we can see here, she was clearly backbiting another wife of the prophet (s) by saying negative things behind her back which were so bad that the prophet (s) said that they would change the colour of the sea !

you have been exposed !]]></description>
