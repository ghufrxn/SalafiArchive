					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2016/05/14/response-to-abu-huraira-enemy-of-allah-his-book-and-a-thief-according-to-umar/#comment-29200&quot;&gt;sayed&lt;/a&gt;.

`Umar didn&#039;t say aba Hurayrah was a disbeliever. When he thought that he abused his position he got angry and accused him of being &quot;An enemy of God&quot;, this is an Arabic expression that you can label anyone who betrays religious duties with, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean Takfeer. Aba Hurayrah explained his position and `Umar understood and wished to appoint him, if `Umar thought that aba Hurayrah apostated he would have executed him. As for you Shia, you believe the entire nation apostated except five or seven, so I can almost guarantee you hell-fire with that belief you Takfeeries.]]></description>

They are both from Ibn Sireen who is narrating both events. It seems like the students of Ibn Sireen need to be looked into.]]></description>
