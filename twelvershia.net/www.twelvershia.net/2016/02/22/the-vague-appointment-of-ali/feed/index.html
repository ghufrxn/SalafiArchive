					<description><![CDATA[Both my father and mother are Shia converts who left the religion of Omar (LA). I present every one of you peoples&#039; false articles to my dad, and he strongly refutes your filth and Nasabi hatred. Burn in your rage; as the Prophet SAWS has said, Ali is with the truth and the Truth does Tawaf around Ali. (:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alhamdulillah I have read your translation of
Minal Qalb Ilal Qabl, that is From heart to the
heart,.. Alhamdulillah I have printed and gave a
free copy to my friends and colleagues… It will
be of great importance if the book of Usman
Alkhamis “” HUQBATUN MINAT TAARIKH “” will
be translated for us into ENGLISH… There many
of our friends here in Nigeria that we want them
to have access to that book to have true
understanding of history of Islam especially
about the calamities that befall ISLAM during the
life of SAHABA, but the major problem is that
they can’t understand Arabic… Many of the
books that black mail the history of those Great
Companions like THEN I WAS GUIDED, TO BE
WITH THE TRUTHFUL, THE RIGHT PATH written
by SHI’A scholars were given to our friends here
and it’s causing a great problem now… Please
and please we are In a dare need of English
translation of HIQBATUM MINAT TAARIKH…
Thank you,, looking forward to hearing from you
soon…]]></description>
