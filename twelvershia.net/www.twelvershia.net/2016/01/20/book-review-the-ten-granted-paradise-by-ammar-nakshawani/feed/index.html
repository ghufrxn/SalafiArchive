					<description><![CDATA[Why this hatred? Why do you need to use such rhetoric. If you, academically, can refute other people’s ideas then by al means, but no need to attack a character or based on his “pronunciations” of certain words. Because I’m sure if we sat for about 30 minutes I could point out many grammatical mistakes of your own. In conclusion, please stop trying to make individuals look bad with subtle negative comments. Find a piece they have said or written, and refute it. Then leave the rest to the reader or listener.]]></description>
