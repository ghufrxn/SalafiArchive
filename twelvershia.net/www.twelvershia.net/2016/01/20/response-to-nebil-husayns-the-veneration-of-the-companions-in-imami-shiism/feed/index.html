How else would he get a position in University of Miami? US Schools have been increasingly hiring those whose main scholarship focuses on either denying Ḥadīth or rejecting Qurʾān. فأما الزبد فيذهب جفاء وأما ما ينفع الناس فيمكث في الأرض There have been hundreds of those &quot;scholars&quot; across Europe from late 19th century until now. Satisfying their masters, they never produced a thing that one can remember!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the problem with many academics in so called &quot;Islamic studies.&quot; On basic aqeeda issues they present the deviant views of philosophers, sufis, mutazila, shia, etc. Nebil Husayn even tries to present the views of the khawarij and Ahmadiyya on his site!! SMH...do any of these groups represent the Quran and the sunnah?]]></description>
