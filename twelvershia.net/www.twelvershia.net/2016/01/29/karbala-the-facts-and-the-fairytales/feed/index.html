Yazeed is not a forefather of the creators of the website, so we do not have a bias to defend him. Yazeed will go down in history as one of the worst rulers of the Islamic Empire, but that does not mean that every criticism against him was true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you sit and listen to the Majaalis you will come to know there is very little history which is known because there were very few people left who were eye witnessed and it took time to spread the message to generations. But in Majaalis they repeat it in different ways to keep Imam Hussain martyrdom fresh in every one heart.
The point is to love Imam Hussain and show respect. Don&#039;t be like the one who were fighting against Imam Hussain, be like the one who support Imam Hussain. The one who were fightig against Imam Hussain are perished and no trace can be found, Imam Hussain will stay alive in every momineen heart.
Imam Hussain the leader of Jannat and we are proud followers of our leader.]]></description>
