Wa alaykum alsalam,

There is a difference of opinion as to whether the Prophet&#039;s - peace be upon him - words meant that it was literally haram for Ali to marry someone else, or if it was simply the disapproval of his father-in-law. Unlike most father-in-law&#039;s, the Prophet - peace be upon him - does have the authority over the Muslims in their political and social affairs. Both are possible interpretations of what exactly went on and we don&#039;t have much more than this narration to act upon. 

You should feel free to criticize our content. We are open to being mistaken. especially if evidence provided to us suggests that we are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

Correct me if I am wrong, are you saying that Imam Ali (a.s) marrying another woman during the life of Hadhrat Fatima (s.a) would had hurt her? But this applies to every other woman on this planet. Every woman cannot tolerate her husband marrying another woman. 

Enemies of Islam bring this incident to show that Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) allowed every Muslim man to have  two or more wives but when the same thing was happening to his own daughter he strongly condemned Imam Ali (a.s) by saying either to divorce his daughter and marry another woman or if he wants his daughter to remain as his wife then he should give-up the idea of marrying another woman. They say that another woman being enemy of Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) is just deception as Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) own daughter Hadhrat Zainab (a.s) was married to enemy of Islam Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi&#039; who fought against Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) in Battle of Badr and was captured but Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) did not nullify his daughter Zainab&#039;s marriage with Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi&#039; because his daughter loved her husband which was going against the rule of Muslimah being married to polytheist.

I am not criticizing your article but am bringing questions asked to Muslims from non-Muslims which we find difficult to answer due to lack of knowledge on Islam.]]></description>

Ali marrying those women does not harm Fatima, nor does it annoy her since she was already dead.
Also, sexual intercourse with a slave girl in another country (Yemen), is no where as hurtful as having to share your husband with another woman on a permanent basis.]]></description>

Salaam.

No, because Imam Ali (a.s) did in fact marry more than one woman after the demise of Hadhrat Fatima (s.a). For e.g. the mother of Hadhrat Abbas (a.s) ibn Ali (a.s) and the mother of Mohammed (a.s) ibn Hanaffiyah.

Below is the ahadith of Sahih Bukhari in which is mentioned an incident showing that Imam Ali (a.s) used to have sex with slave-girls during the lifetime of Hadhrat Fatima (s.a) and Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w) without the later objecting to this act of Imam Ali (a.s)

Volume 5, Book 59, Number 637:
Narrated Buraida:

The Prophet sent &#039;Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus (of the booty) and I hated Ali, and &#039;Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave-girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, &quot;Don&#039;t you see this (i.e. Ali)?&quot; When we reached the Prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, &quot;O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you hate him, for he deserves more than that from the Khumlus.&quot;]]></description>
