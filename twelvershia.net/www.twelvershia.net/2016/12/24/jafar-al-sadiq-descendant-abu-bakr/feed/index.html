The son of Muhammad bin Abu Bakr is al-Qasim bin Muhammad who is one of the biggest scholars of Ahlul-Sunnah. Muhammad was not a Rafidi, in fact `Ali cursed `Uthman&#039;s killers in several authentic reports, we believe Muhammad turned back and did not kill `Uthman as is recorded in several sources. Muhammad is has been reported to have praised his father Abu Bakr in a Sahih Hadith, so he certainly is no Rafidi.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They argue back by saying that although the Imams from Ja&#039;far and onward are all descendants of Abu Bakr (ra), it is through his son Muhammad who they say was a rafidhi shi&#039;i. As have been claimed in the comments already, they say he took part in the killing of Uthman aswell. In other words, they say that the imams are from the line of Muhammad b. Abi Bakr who was a completely different man compared to his father. My humble suggestion therefore is that you make an article about him, the lies and rumours surrounding him, the Sunni stance with regards to him, and also whether or not his sons etc were rawafidh.]]></description>

Oh so you take Mu`awiyah&#039;s statement now? Mu`awiyah simply meant that Ibn Abi Bakr&#039;s actions in opposing `Uthman&#039;s leadership are against his father&#039;s opinion since Aba Bakr used to tell `Uthman &quot;You are surely worthy of leadership.&quot; As for Ibn Abi Bakr, I can quote you authentic narrations of him praising Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, he also repented from entering on `Uthman when the latter reminded him of his father. If you wish to believe he did kill him as opposed to facts, then Muhammad bin Abu Bakr is cursed by `Ali, since `Ali in authentic narrations cursed all killers of `Uthman. In the end, Muhammad bin Abi Bakr&#039;s life ended tragically and his son al-Qassim bin Muhammad bin Abu Bakr (grandfather of al-Sadiq) was one of the biggest scholars of Ahlul-Sunnah and narrates a lot in the books of Hadith, he did not believe in &quot;Imamah&quot; or any superstition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pathetic argument. Muhammad ibn Abu bakr (ra) was a Shia of Ali (as) who fought against amr as and muawiyah until he was eventually killed by them in egypt. Even muawiyah called him &quot;the one who faults his own father&quot;. For this reason, Sunnis don&#039;t call him (ra) or the uncle of the believers. He also took part in the killing of uthman. What a pathetic argument. Sunnis even say the Prophets saw parents were kaafirs, but try and use this to prove Abu bakr is good.]]></description>
