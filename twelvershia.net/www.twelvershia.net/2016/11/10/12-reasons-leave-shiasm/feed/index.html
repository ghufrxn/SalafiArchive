Assalamualaikum;

To Allama Riaz Carmali, I read your comment on Salafi having Anthropomorphic beliefs. What are you talking about? Have you ever actually conversed with someone who follows this particuar school of thought?

I myself follow this path, and may Allah protect us, for certainly we do NOT say such things. 

Perhaps you have been misinformed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the Name of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA, THE GRACIOUS, THE MERCIFUL.

Salams to all.

Bi Idhnil LLAAHI TA&#039;ALA,

I am a Sufi Twelver Shia Muslim and a Sufi Muslim Theologian and Researcher.

I have the following comment to make.

Unfortunately two third of Sufis are on the wrong path.
Only one third of Sufis are in the Path of the Holy Quran.

Having said this, I am proudly a Shia Muslim. But I always strive for the unity of the Ummah of our Master Muhammad (saw).
It is true that many shias are misled and out Islam. 

But many Sunni Barelvis are also out of Islam.

The former make Holy Imam Ali (as) as a semi-god, the latter make Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) a semi-god.
Both are on the Path of Xirk.

The Salafis are no better because many are Anthropomorphists and falsely ascribe to ALLAH TA&#039;ALA properties of HIS Creation like Hands, Feet, Eyes and Face!! This is Xirk and totally goes against Surah 112 of the Holy Quran, Surah 42 Ayah 11 of the Holy Quran, Surah 6 Ayah 151 (alla tushriku bihi xay&#039;a) of the Holy Quran,and many other passages of the Book of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA.

But among the Shia, and among the Barelvi Sunni, and among the Salafi, are True Muslims who abide by the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of our beloved Master Muhammad (saw).

So, my advice to both, the owners of this Website, and to fanatic readers, is that, forget your diferrences and stop labeling the totality of a specific sect (shia, barelvi, salafi) as disbelievers, and unite under the Flag of TAWHID and under the Flag of the Holy Quran, just as ALLAH TA&#039;ALA said in HIS Book, in Surah 3, Ayah 103, where HE, THE MOST HIGH, THE ABSOLUTE, says:
&quot;And hold fast to the rope (the holy quran) of ALLAH, altogether, and do not become divided. And remember ALLAH&#039;s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and HE reconciled your hearts, and by HIS grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and HE saved you from it. ALLAH thus clarifies HIS revelations for you, so that you may be guided.&quot;

Wa Akhirud Dawana Anil Hamdu lil LLAAHI RABB il Alameen.

Allama Riaz Carmali.

Wassalam]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally some of us Sunni&#039;s are being proactive on this subject. Like a brother mentioned above in the comments. The Rafidah had a lot of their propaganda on the web, Masha&#039;Allah some of us have risen to battle that. To the administrators, thank you for this website. Asalamu&#039;Alaikum. P.S. All the Shia have ever done, is stab the Muslims behind their back, making deals with the Crusaders against Salahudin Al-Ayubi, helping the Mongols slaughter Muslims, till this day, slaughtering Sunnis in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and much more. What did they ever do? Lobby for the U.S. Invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. Funny, Afghanistan to the East of Iran, Iraq to the West of Iran, Sadam (Sunni), and in Afghanistan Sunni, both invaded, Iran never touched ever by the US (fact) go figure... But but but, Iwan hates Amewica, Iwan and Amewica al goin to fight... Salam]]></description>
