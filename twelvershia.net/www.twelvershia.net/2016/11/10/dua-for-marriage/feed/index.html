Wa alaykum alsalam wa rahmatullah. Thank you for the kind words brother. If you are referring to the video on Sirat Education, then it is not ours. He just gave us a shout-out. That is all. =) 

I can always ask the brother which software he uses if you&#039;d like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah. Brother, I have tried many times to contact you via YouTube and Twitter. Your YouTube videos exposing the Rafidha is an incredible service to the Ummah and may Allah reward you and protect you. I have posted many documents on Twitter and Instagram exposing the false prophets Elijah Muhammad, Louis Farrakhan and Elijah&#039;s son, WD Mohammed. I want to produce a series of YouTube videos exposing them and found your videos very inspiring. I simply want to know what type of video editing software you used? Please let me know and may Allah reward you
Wa salam
Idris]]></description>
