Mukhtar-Nameh is an inaccurate Iranian TV show made for an audience that reads nothing except Persian propaganda. Anybody who&#039;s opened a legit Sunni or Shia book knows this character is a fraud who tried to build an empire over the corpse of Husayn (ra).]]></description>

Kaysani Shia sect was from the biggest and strongest Shia sects at the time, banu al-`Abbas greatly relied upon them to topple the Umayyads. After `Abbasies appointed one of their own as ruler the Kaysanis split into two groups, one of which believed Imamah was transferred from `Ali&#039;s children to `Abbas&#039;s offspring.]]></description>

Thank you very much for your informative answer. 

I just want you to tell me more about your last paragraph, &quot;His sect lived on for around 200 years and were the main driving force behind the success of banu al-`Abbas.&quot; 

How did Mukhtar and his sect led to success for Bani Abbas?]]></description>

`Abdullah bin `Umar may have helped him the first time assuming that story is reliable, Mukhtar only got in trouble for helping Muslim bin `Aqil.

ِAgain you need to remember, it&#039;s very likely that the second report or both are actually lies. These are shaky reports and we don&#039;t know the chains. Mukhtar was a VERY sly man, he managed to trick the Kufan Shia, Muhammad bin `Ali &amp; `Abdullah bin al-Zubayr, so it isn&#039;t surprising if he also made something up, tried to get `Abdullah bin `Umar to vouch for him and get him out of jail.

More importantly, both of these events are before the actual Fitnah of al-Mukhtar. At the beginning al-Mukhtar claimed he recieved letters from Muhammad bin `Ali requesting him to avenge the death of his brother, this may or may not be true. However, The true Fitnah started when al-Mukhtar alongside one of `Ali&#039;s servants called &quot;Kaysan&quot; began to spread blasphemous lies and attribute them to ibn al-Hanafiyyah, they managed to attract a group of the Saba&#039;iyyah and converted many ignorant Kufans to the Imami Kaysani sect, then he started claiming prophet-hood shortly before he was killed.

At this point as recorded in &quot;al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah&quot; it is narrated that some folks came to ibn `Umar and told him: &quot;Your brother in law claims he receives inspiration?&quot; ibn `Umar replied with the verse: {The Devils INSPIRE their friends to dispute with you; if you obey them, you are idolaters.}

His sect lived on for around 200 years and were the main driving force behind the success of banu al-`Abbas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found an article online which mentions about Abdullah bin Umar helping Mukhtar to get out of prison twice. First time as you have mentioned before his fitna. And second time after his fitna had started.

Thanks for the reply. About the sources I don&#039;t know about its reliability. I just read in one of the Shia book written on Mukhtar where the writer argues that Mukhtar had support of Abdullah ibn Umar during his rebel against the government because whenever the government use to imprison him... Mukhtar used to ask help from Abdullah ibn Umar through his sister i.e. Mukhtar&#039;s sister used to pressurize Abdullah ibn Umar to get Mukhtar out of prison. The thing which I did not understand is... if the above mentioned incident is true then why did Abdullah ibn Umar get into the pressure and asked for the release of Mukhtar? Instead Abdullah ibn Umar should had told his wife that he would not support such a person who is causing fitna against the government.]]></description>

From what I read, Ibn `Umar married Mukhtar&#039;s sister, Mukhtar&#039;s family had its position in society, Mukhtar went to jail after his father-in-law was removed from government and replaced by Ibn Ziyad. Mukhtar had hosted Muslim in his house and spoke of supporting him, this landed Mukhtar in a lot of trouble and he went to prison. Mukhtar wrote to Ibn Umar and begged him to speak on his behalf. Ibn Umar wrote to Yazid directly and the man was released but exiled from Kufah. There&#039;s no issue here as Mukhtar had not yet turned to public deviance. Mukhtar would later team up with one of `Ali&#039;s servants and create the Kaysani sect and form armies, that&#039;s the beginning of Mukhtar&#039;s evil.]]></description>
