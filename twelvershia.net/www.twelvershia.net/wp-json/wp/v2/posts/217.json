Vol. 10, Pg. # 180.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tabarani\u2019s chain includes Abdulkarim Al-Khazaz. Mughlatai in his Iktifa\u2019a 3\/7 (Dar Al-Azhar) shows the weakness of this narration by quoting those that weakened him, including Al-Azdi, Abu Hatim Al-Razi, Ibn Abd Al-Bar, Al-Saji, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. Al-Tabarani himself says that nobody has narrated this narration except for Abdulkarim Al-Khazaz. (Al-Mu\u2019jam Al-Awsat 1\/211, Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyah, 1420, first edition)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then accuses Ahl Al-Sunnah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">If one wishes to use \u2018Alayhis Salaam\u2019 upon the Messengers of\u00a0Allah\u00a0(saw) or the Ahlulbayt (a.s), according to the &#8216;Tashayyu&#8217; (Those who follow the 12 successors after the Prophet), it is deemed permissible.\u00a0It should not come as a surprise in order to prevent people from using this term the Nawaasb have attempted to even remove it from some of the manuscripts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the first example, RTS quotes a narration from Musnad Ahmad, with the Tahqeeq of Shuayb Al-Arnaut, in which the term \u201cAlayhi al-salam\u201d that follows the name of Ali cannot be found. RTS hints that Ahl Al-Sunnah have removed this term due to their Nasb. However, if we go through the very first pages of the same edition of the book, we find that Shuayb Al-Arnaut includes the term <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/waqmsnda\/msnda01#page\/n211\/mode\/2up\" rel=\"external nofollow\">\u201calayhi al-salam\u201d<\/a> for Ali (p.213). This implies that there is no foul play occurring, for if that was the case, then the editors would have removed the term from all of the text. Thus, it becomes clear that these differences occur due to the different variations in the manuscripts that reach contemporary editors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS also gives other examples of this alleged manipulation of the text, in which he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Now A Revised Edition in Which the very same Hadeeth &#8216;(\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645)&#8217; has been replaced with &#8216;(r.a)&#8217;!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Source: Saheeh Bukhari,\u00a0Printed by: Dar Ibn Kathir (Damascus and Beirut)\u00a0Pg. 1260 Book 65 H # 4949.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the Dar Ibn Kathir publishing house itself includes the term \u201calayhi al-salam\u201d with the name Ali in other pages. See page 1064 and 1225. Once again, this shows that this so-called Nasb plays no part in these events. Ironically, the latter example is included by the RTS author himself in the next example. Then, ironically, RTS also includes other narrations in which Al-Hussain bin Ali and Fatima Al-Zahra\u2019a are both included with the terms \u201calayhi alsalam\u201d in the same version that is provided by Dar Ibn Kathir. How does this in any way show that there is manipulation occurring in the text?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end of the article RTS argues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> The exists [sic] a difference in opinion regarding the phrase &#8216;(A.S)&#8217; according to the so called &#8216;Ahl Sunnah&#8217;. For the followers of the Ahlul-Bayt such a matter is impossible to be under dispute. So the question remains on where the evidence lies ?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The evidence lies with Ahl Al-Sunnah. For the difference of opinion does not necessitate for the truth to leave the bounds of Ahl Al-Sunnah, and this is the case with all of the matters of the Shari\u2019ah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It should be known that the difference that exists within Ahl Al-Sunnah regarding this matter is nothing more than an issue of jurisprudence. It is not a sectarian issue.
