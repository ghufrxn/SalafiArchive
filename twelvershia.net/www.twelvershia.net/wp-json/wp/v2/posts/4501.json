The great muhaddith, Abu Ya\u2019la Al-Khalili (d. 446), quotes a hadith critic saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI have observed the reports that were fabricated by the Kufans regarding the virtues of \u2018Ali and his family, and they were more than 300,000 fabricated reports.\u201d (Al-Khalili 419)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn al-Jawzi said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Rafida\u2019s extreme love of Ali led them to fabricate many reports demonstrating his virtues. Most of these reports actually ended up harming him and depicting him in a negative manner. I have listed some of those reports in my book, al-Mawdu\u2019aat.\u201d (Ibn Al-Jawzi 89)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, it should not be a surprise for the reader to encounter a variety of bizarre and extremely exaggerated reports regarding the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb in Shi\u2019ite literature. In this article, we shall present a collection of similar reports deemed \u201cauthentic\u201d by Shi\u2019ite scholarship, and we shall then challenge every single Shi\u2019ite on this planet to substantiate the claims made in these reports.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Prelude to the Challenge<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The collection of reports that shall be presented today is a slew of strange reports mostly found in <em>Basa\u2019ir Al-Darajat <\/em>by Al-Saffar (d. 290). In his book, Al-Saffar lists a series of reports stating that the <em>Wilayah<\/em> of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb was enforced and upheld by ALL past prophets of God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are some of those reports:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Al-Saffar, from Muhammad b. Al-Husayn, from Wahib b. Hafs, from Abu Basir, who said: Abu Ja\u2019far (as) said: Our <em>Wilayah<\/em> is the <em>Wilayah <\/em>of Allah, which no prophet has been sent except by it. (Al-Saffar 95)<\/li>\n<li>Al-Saffar, from Ahmed b. Muhammad, from \u2018Ali b. Al-Hakam, from Sayf b. \u2018Umayrah, from Abu Bakr Al-Hadhrami, from Hudhayfah b. Usayd, from the Messenger of Allah: \u201cThe prophethood of a prophet was never complete until my <em>Wilayah<\/em> and the <em>Wilayah <\/em>of my Ahlulbait was presented forth to him and he then submits to their obedience and (Al-Saffar 93)<\/li>\n<li>Al-Saffar, from Al-Sindi b. Muhammad, from Yunus b. Ya\u2019qub, from \u2018Abdul\u2019A\u2019la, who said: Abu \u2018Abdullah said: No prophet has ever become a prophet until he recognizes our rights and our superiority over everyone else. (Al-Saffar 94)<\/li>\n<li>Al-Saffar, from Al-\u2018Abbas b. Ma\u2019ruf, from Hammad b. \u2018Isa, from Rab\u2019i, from Muhammad b. Muslim, from Abu Ja\u2019far (as) regarding the ayah, \u201cHad they upheld the Torah, Injil and what had been revealed to them from their Lord,\u201d he said: \u201c[It is] the <em>Wilayah<\/em>.\u201d (Al-Saffar 96)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: All of these reports are authentic (according to Shi\u2019i standards).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Saffar, in this context, lists tens of other reports that corroborate and demonstrate the same theme; however, these examples shall suffice.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Challenge<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is quite bizarre how such reports elevate Ali way beyond the status of a mere political and religious successor of Prophet Muhammad, as believed by the initial Shias. Rather, his <em>Wilayah<\/em> is now presented as a pillar of faith that EVERY single prophet from Adam till Muhammad ~ was sent by and obliged to acknowledge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These fabrications, which are purely the result of cumulative <em>ghuluww, <\/em>were eventually adopted and believed by the Twelver community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is the challenge?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is very simple:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since these reports claim that the <em>Wilayah<\/em> of Ali b. Abi Taleb was upheld by ALL prophets of God such that they only became prophets after acknowledging the <em>Wilayah <\/em>and that it was fundamental to their prophethood, we challenge the Shia to produce the following:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>A single explicit verse from the Old Testament, New Testament, or the Quran where any Prophet of God is quoted upholding, emphasizing, preaching or believing in the <em>Wilayah <\/em>of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hint: Twenty-five prophets are mentioned in the Quran, along with many of their core teachings. It would, indeed, be bizarre (in light of these reports) if none of them were ever mentioned in the context of the <em>Wilayah<\/em> of Ali. If the Shi\u2019i polemicist is not capable of presenting a single instance in the Quran where a prophet is sent by the <em>Wilayah<\/em> of \u2018Ali or commanded to uphold it, then we are gracious enough to expand the scope of this challenge to the Old and New Testament.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Shi\u2019ite is not able to find a single verse to substantiate these various claims, then perhaps this is a good opportunity to cast doubt on this narrative, and question the actual reliability of such bizarre and exaggerated fabrications that have been authenticated and ascribed to the Imams by the Shia.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cSo if they fail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah?
