Guarding livestock<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">2. Hunting<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">The problem however was that Abu Huraira had a field and he was guarding it with dogs. Was he losing rewards? No way! He thus added a new phrase. Muslim records:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who kept a dog except one meant for watching the herd, or for hunting or for watching the fields. he lost two qirat of reward every day. Zuhri said: The words of Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) were conveyed to Ibn Umar who said: May Allah have mercy upon Abu Huraira; HE OWNED A FIELD.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Sahih Muslim, Book 10, Number 3823<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">When Ibn Umar heard about Abu Huraira&#8217;s addition, he attributed it to his owning a field?! Thus, he was accusing Abu Huraira of having fabricated the exception for personal reasons!!!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Does this not make Abu Huraira a liar?!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guided\u2019s points fall short due to the fact that Ibn Omar himself ended up adopting the addition mentioned by <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/01\/11\/abu-huraira\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Abu Huraira<\/a>. See Saheeh Muslim #2946. This suggests that Ibn Omar was not accusing Abu Huraira, but rather suggesting that Abu Huraira remembered this addition since he was an owner of a field, so it was natural for him to remember this.<br \/>\nIt should also be noted that Sufyan bin Abi Zuhair also narrated that he heard the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) say that a dog for the fields is one of the exceptions.
