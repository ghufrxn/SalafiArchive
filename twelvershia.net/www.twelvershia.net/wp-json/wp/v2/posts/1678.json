Some chapters will include a single report whereas others will include many.\u00a0Each report is\u00a0listed under the name of the book we quoted it from as well as its Arabic text.\u00a0This makes the job of the researcher easier when looking them up in their respective sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Initially the plan was to write a book containing only what the author deems authentic but we soon realized the difficulty of this task. We instead decided to include every virtue for Hazrat Abu Bakr in the books of Hadith.\u00a0This also proved to be very difficult as we were surprised by the large number of reports praising him and so finally we decided to include only some of his virtues which we picked and translated as accurately as we could.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This English book of Hadith is estimated to contain about a fourth of the virtues of Hazrat Abu Bakr that we came across during the research, should any of our Arabic speaking readers be interested in finding the rest we suggest the following works:<\/p>\n<p>-Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra by Ibn Sa`d, under the chapter of Hazrat Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p>-Fada\u2019il al-Sahabah by Ahmad, under the section on Hazrat Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p>-Tarikh Dimashq by Ibn `Asakir, under the biography of Hazrat Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p>-Mustadrak `ala al-Sahihayn by al-Hakim, under Hazrat Abu Bakr\u2019s biography.<\/p>\n<p>-Al-Riyad al-Nadirah by al-Muhibb, check the part on Hazrat Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p>-Al-Rawd al-Aniq by Ibn Zinjawayh, a book regarding Hazrat Abu Bakr\u2019s superiority.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>INDEX:<\/h2>\n<div><\/div>\n<div data-canvas-width=\"186.88879999999995\">1.
