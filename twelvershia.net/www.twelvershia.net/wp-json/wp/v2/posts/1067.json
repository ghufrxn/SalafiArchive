Are you not son of the Cursed one, who was cursed by Holy Prophet (asws)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSoA uses this second narration in order to make it seem that Al-Bukhari\u2019s biased caused him to shorten the hadith. However, when we return to the opinions of the scholars, we find that this action cannot be attributed to Al-Bukhari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Albani 7\/724 continues by quoting the opinion of Ibn Hajar, who weakened the words attributed to Abd Al-Rahman bin Abi Bakr by saying that this addition cannot be found in the narration of Al-Bukhari. In other words, he is saying that Al-Bukhari\u2019s version is stronger due to the quality of the narrators.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nHowever, Al-Albani himself responded, \u201cWhat is the point of this response since he knows that the addition is authentic in its chain and that it came from a path that is different from the path of Al-Bukhari?!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn other words, Al-Albani is not accusing Al-Bukhari for the different wordings, but rather is saying that this narration comes through a completely different route, which is completely correct. The narration of Al-Bukhari comes through Yusuf bin Mahak, while the narration of Ibn Abi Hatim from Abdullah Al-Bahee. So, these are two narrations from two different people about a single event. In conclusion, there is no evidence that suggests that this is the doing of Al-Bukhari, nor that he is manipulating narrations in order to protect Bani Umayyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cBukhari Narrating Hadeeth in Short Form Due to Love for Bani Umayyah?\u201d The article can be found here.
