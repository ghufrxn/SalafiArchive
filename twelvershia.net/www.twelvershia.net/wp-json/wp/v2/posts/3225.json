This is a silly accusation since the Arabic text of the Qur\u2019an is vague regarding the meaning of the verse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah the Almighty states:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0624\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u062c\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The terms \u201cYu\u2019toon ma Aatoo\u201d can hold various meanings. It can mean \u201cthose that commit what they have committed\u201d or \u201cthose that give what they give\u201d or \u201cthose that enter forth where they have entered\u201d. Due to this, the understanding of the words can suggest a positive or a negative connotation, and in this case, A\u2019isha assumed that it was a negative connotation, since the verse continues that those that do this have fear within their hearts. In other words, a mistake in understanding this narration is only human, which is why A\u2019isha was keen to ask the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 about the meaning, since she had doubts about her own understanding.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, we find that SlaveOfAhlubait is filled with so much hatred for Abu Bakr that he could not translate the narration correctly. The narration includes the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 saying to A\u2019isha, \u201cNo, O\u2019 daughter of Al-Sideeq.\u201d However, SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s fingers would not move upon the keyboard to include this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refer to the image below:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/?attachment_id=3227\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3227 external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3227 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/sideeq-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"sideeq\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/sideeq-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/sideeq-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/sideeq-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/sideeq-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s \u201cAyesha and her ability to understand\u00a0quran\u201d.
