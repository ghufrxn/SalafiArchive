Rather, this was the version that he heard from Al-Humaydi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For starts, this was also narrated in Saheeh Al-Bukhari through Ibn Al-Madeeni from Sufyan bin Uyaynah #3201, without mentioning the name of Samura.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nAl-Shafi\u2019ee does the same in his Kitab Al-Umm from Sufyan bin Uyaynah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Al-Jarood also mentioned it in this manner through Ibn Al-Muqri\u2019 and Mahmood bin Adam #560. While Ya`qoub bin Shaybah narrated this version through Al-Fadhl bin Dukayn #2.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu `Awanah too narrated this tradition in his Mustakhraj from the narration of Al-Za`farani and others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, we also find the narration of Sufyan bin Uyaynah with the inclusion of the name of Samura through other paths, like Ahmad in his Musnad, `Abdulrazzaq, Abu Bakr bin Abi Shaybah, Abu Khaythama, and others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, we can be sure that both versions have been heard from Sufyan bin Uyaynah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, we can also be sure that Al-Humaydi has narrated both versions too, since we find in Al-Sawma`ee\u2019s narration from Al-Humaydi in Mustakhraj Abi `Awanah 3\/106 that he refers to the person that sold the alcohol as &#8220;Fulan&#8221; (so and so), so he never specified.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps the nail in the coffin is the fact that Al-Bukhari did teach his students that the person in the Hadith is Samura bin Jundub, and not some other Samura, nor is it some anonymous man.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We find this in Al-`Ilal by Al-Tirmithy (p.205) where he authenticates the Hadith and affirms that the person named is Samura bin Jundub. This leads us to the conclusion that Al-Bukhari was not hiding the name of Samura, for he clearly taught this very fact to his students, but rather, recorded from Al-Humaydi what he heard from him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to ShiaPen\u2019s article \u201cEfforts of Bukhari to Hide Identity of Alcohol Seller Sahabi.\u201d The article can be found here.
