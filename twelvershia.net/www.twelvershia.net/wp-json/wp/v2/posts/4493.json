Shi\u2019ite scholarship, however, seems to have bypassed this criticism by actually relying upon this man\u2019s transmission on many instances. 19<sup>th<\/sup> century Shi\u2019ite scholar of hadith, Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi, makes note of this reality, and describes Abu Al-Mufaddal saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe was from the great <em>shuyukh<\/em> of <em>ijazah<\/em>, even though they weakened him. I have observed that their practice is contrary to [their criticism of him]\u201d (Al-Shahrudi 7\/188)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I initially made note of this phenomenon as I went through Mo\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith, where I noticed that Al-Tusi\u2019s chains of transmission regularly converged back to Abu Al-Mufaddal. Al-Tusi\u2019s dependence on Abu Al-Mufaddal is mostly limited to the transmission of the books and works of earlier transmitters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a common practice that can be observed in Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi\u2019s works on <em>rijal<\/em>. They will often list the transmitter\u2019s name, mention any praise\/criticism he has received, and then list their chains of transmission to any of his book(s).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reader may ask: \u201cWhat are the implications of this phenomenon?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reality of the matter is that this issue may be of many grave implications. We now know that Al-Tusi depended on unreliably transmitted content ascribed to the transmitters of hadith while he assessed their reliability. Since Al-Tusi did not meet most of the transmitters listed in his books, Shi\u2019ite polemicists argue that Al-Tusi must have relied upon later textual indicators to evaluate the reliability of earlier transmitters. However, if these later indicators are based on faulty and unreliable transmission of biographical data that cannot be authentically ascribed to the transmitters being evaluated, then Al-Tusi\u2019s conclusions are simply unreliable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How can we trust his verdicts on many transmitters when they are based on unreliably transmitted texts solely transmitted through liars, forgers, weak and anonymous transmitters?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Note: There is a great possibility that Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi\u2019s evaluation of transmitters is absolutely arbitrary and not based on any objective standard, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/01\/20\/10-reasons-why-you-should-not-trust-shia-hadith-sources\/\">previously pointed out<\/a>.

Major Shi\u2019ite <em>rijali <\/em>sources then bypass all the criticism and regularly rely upon Abu Al-Mufaddal\u2019s transmission as they transmitted key biographical data exclusively through him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us take a look at an example under the biographical entry of Al-Hasan b. \u2018Ali b. Al-No\u2019man in <em>Mo\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith<\/em>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Najashi said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAl-Hasan b. \u2018Ali Al-No\u2019man, the <em>mawla<\/em> of Bani Hashem. His father is \u2018Ali b. Al-No\u2019man Al-A\u2019lam. He was a reliable <em>thabt. <\/em>He has a book called <em>Nawadir Al-Hadith<\/em>, that is Sahih and of great benefit. Ibn Nuh transmitted it to me, from Al-Bazufari, from Ahmed b. Idris, from Al-Saffar, from him [Al-Hasan].\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tusi said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAl-Hasan b. \u2018Ali Al-No\u2019man, the <em>mawla<\/em> of Bani Hashem.He has a book called <em>Nawadir Al-Hadith<\/em>, that is of great benefit. A group of my companions have transmitted it to me from <u>Abu Al-Mufaddal<\/u>, from Ibn Buttah, from Ahmed b. Abi \u2018Abdillah and Al-Saffar both from him.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei then comments saying: \u201cThe sheikh\u2019s [Al-Tusi\u2019s] \u00a0isnad to him is weak, due to Abu Al-Mufaddal and Ibn Buttah.\u201d (Al-Khoei 6:61-62)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: Al-Khoei refrains from commenting on Al-Najashi\u2019s isnad to Al-Hasan\u2019s book, even though it is weak due to Al-Bazufari, Ahmed b. Ja\u2019far.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, in this example, we observe Al-Tusi making a value judgement on Al-Hasan\u2019s book, even though his copy of that book is transmitted to him through the forger, Abu Al-Mufaddal, and the unknown transmitter, Ibn Buttah. How can Al-Tusi come to such a conclusion regarding the book ascribed to Al-Hasan b. \u2018Ali when his copy was transmitted to him through a forger AND an anonymous transmitter?!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Najashi makes a similar value judgement on the book even though his copy, too, is unreliably transmitted to him through the anonymous transmitter, Ahmed b. Ja\u2019far Al-Bazufari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now we know that the only form of tangible textual evidence pertaining to this transmitter Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi may have possessed is a text that is transmitted to them from unreliable sources. They have not listed any other potential textual indicators they may have evaluated to assess the reliability of the transmitter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This phenomenon opens to the door to many questions, most importantly:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi relied upon untrustworthy and unreliable sources to document the biographical data of many transmitters, how can we assume that their assessments and verdicts pertaining to the reliability of transmitters are accurate and representative of reality?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why is a liar, like Abu Al-Mufaddal, such an extremely prolific transmitter and source of information in Shi\u2019ite <em>rijali <\/em>sources?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: Abu Al-Mufaddal was the sole narrator of other works in Fihrist Al-Tusi, including the works of Al-Hasan bin Musa Al-Kashshab, Al-Hasan bin Ali Al-Washsha\u2019, Ali bin Hadeed, Ali bin Hasaan Al-Wasiti, Abdul-Rahman bin Abi Al-Najran, \u00a0Al-Ayyashi, Abu Ali bin Hammam, and Yunus bin Ya\u2019qoub.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Shi\u2019ite polemicist attempts to have his cake and eat it by undermining the value and role of Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi\u2019s transmission of the books of earlier transmitters, then he opens the door to another greater problem, which is the question of whether Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi actually relied upon tangible textual indicators when evaluating the reliability of earlier transmitters or whether their verdicts are totally arbitrary and not based on an objective textual analysis of the transmitter\u2019s transmission.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another noteworthy point is that Shi\u2019ite polemicists regularly boast about how their tradition is based on (extinct) written collections from the earliest of Shi\u2019ite transmitters. However, we have seen here that many of these claims are inaccurate, unverified and often incorrect since they are frequently made by transmitters who were weak, unknown or suspected of forgery.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shi\u2019ite scholarship\u2019s reliance upon the forger, Abu Al-Mufaddal, in <em>rijali <\/em>biographical sources is merely an example of a much more significant problem. Many similarly weak and unknown transmitters are regularly cited in Shi\u2019ite <em>rijali <\/em>sources as transmitters of the books and works of earlier transmitters. This spans transmitters such as: Musa b. Ja\u2019far Al-Ha\u2019iri, Ahmed b. Ja\u2019far Al-Bazufari, Ibn Buttah Al-Qommi, Ahmed b. Muhammad b. Yahya Al-\u2018Attar and many others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This phenomenon should be enough of a reason for the honest Muslim to cast doubts on the reliability and authority of Shi\u2019ite <em>rijali <\/em>sources. It is unfortunate to see an entire religion based on such faulty and historically defective sources; however, guidance, at the end of the day, is in the hands of Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Allah is the best of witnesses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Sources<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei, Abu Al-Qasem.
