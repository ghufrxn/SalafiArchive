After reading them, I only felt the urge to respond to one of the defenses of Ibn B\u0101bawayh (or Ibn B\u0101b\u016byah) aka al-\u1e62ad\u016bq. The defense of this particular <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em> was written by Sh. A\u1e25mad Salm\u0101n, whom I consider an ideological opponent, but sincerely respect for his bright scholarly mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before providing the response, I\u2019ve shared the <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em>\nin question, along with my argument, in order to provide the necessary\nbackground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The \u1e24ad\u012bth<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibn B\u0101bawayh reported: `Abdullah bin Jundub narrated<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a>\nfrom M\u016bs\u0101 bin Ja`far (peace be onto him), he said: \u201cYou say in the prostration\nof thankfulness: O\u2019 Allah, I call you to witness and I call your angels,\nprophets, messengers and all creation, that you Allah are my Lord, that Islam\nis my religion, Mu\u1e25ammad is my prophet, and that `Ali, al-\u1e24asan, al-\u1e24usayn, `Al\u012b\nbin al-\u1e24usayn, Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b, Ja`far bin Mu\u1e25ammad, M\u016bs\u0101 bin Ja`far, `Al\u012b\nbin M\u016bs\u0101, Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b, `Al\u012b bin Mu\u1e25ammad, al-\u1e24asan bin `Al\u012b, and Allah\u2019s\nproof, the son of al-\u1e24asan bin `Al\u012b, are my Imams; I show loyalty for them and\ndisavow their enemies&#8230;\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say: Al-Kulayn\u012b narrates it from `Al\u012b bin Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, from his father, from `Abdill\u0101h bin Jundub without any mention of the names of the Imams except for `Al\u012b: \u201cMu\u1e25ammad is my prophet and that `Al\u012b and so-and-so are my Im\u0101ms.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The Significance of this Manipulation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between the two reports is clear. One report\nexplicitly mentions the names of all of the Im\u0101ms. The other report does not.\nThe argument I am making is that the original report has been tampered with in\norder to justify the Sh\u012ba belief in all Twelve Imams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibn B\u0101bawayh\u2019s version conflicts with what the Twelver Sh\u012ba\ndeem authentic as reported by Ibn Ab\u012b Ya`f\u016br<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a>\nas well as others, that the Im\u0101m of the age does not die before Allah reveals\nto him the identity of the executioner of his will (i.e succeeding Im\u0101m). The\nnames of all Im\u0101ms were never known to them. In another authentic report<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a>\nwe find the Im\u0101m abstaining from informing his close companion Ism\u0101`\u012bl bin\nMihr\u0101n about the successor\u2019s identity until the moment before his death. This\nis another sign that the Sh\u012ba never knew the names of all Im\u0101ms, unlike what is\nfound in Ibn B\u0101bawayh\u2019s text. Furthermore, al-Kulayn\u012b\u2019s text is closer to the\nhistorical reality, since it is known that the followers of the heads of the\nprophetic household greatly differed in designating who their Imams were after\nM\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Response by Sh. A\u1e25mad Salm\u0101n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sh. A\u1e25mad Salm\u0101n, in response to the accusation, provides alternative possible explanations to deflect the accusation made against Ibn B\u0101bawayh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These explanations are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Al-Kulayn\u012b summarized the\nreport and there are no additions.<\/li><li>The addition exists, but it\nis acceptable since it came from a reliable transmitter.<\/li><li>The addition was actually a\ncommentary by Ibn B\u0101bawayh.<\/li><li>There was a distortion, but\nit was from Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b M\u0101jil\u016byah.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The response provided by Sh. A\u1e25mad Salm\u0101n can be found on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PurifiedTruth\/status\/993453375822946305\" rel=\"external nofollow\">twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Possibility #1<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color\">\u201cThe most that can be said is that the narration that Saduq narrated had additional text which Kulayni summarized and shortened, and when Saduq narrated the hadith he included the full original narration.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The claim mentioned is extremely unlikely, for two reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>There are no motives for al-Kulayn\u012b to shorten the report. Al-Kulayn\u012b is very aware that the number of reports that list out all the Im\u0101ms are quite scarce, especially during his time. In the whole of Al-K\u0101f\u012b, Al-Kulayn\u012b only provides two reports that list all the names of the Im\u0101ms. Why would Al-Kulayn\u012b sabotage this extremely important report that explicitly lists the names of all the Imams?<\/li><li>Ibn B\u0101bawayh, on the other hand, had a very good reason to tamper with the report. The narration, in its original form, did not support Twelver doctrine more than it supported any of the tens of Sh\u012b\u2019\u012b sects. However, after the alteration, it became one of the most explicit proofs for Twelverism. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Possibility #2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color\">\u201cDifferences regarding adding or leaving out text between narrations is well known and famous in the book [sic] of the sciences of hadith. It has been established by all scholars of this science that additional text that is narrated by trustworthy narrators, if the addition is not solitary (and out of place) or in opposition to other narrations, is accepted.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are in agreement that there are cases in which additions can\nbe accepted. However, the report does not meet the conditions that are\nrequired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement made by Sh. A\u1e25mad is accurate only in cases\nwhere the reliability of the narrator is a given. In other words, the analysis\ndone on the additions of a trustworthy narrator revolve around the report\nitself, and whether it should be accepted or rejected. It has no bearing on the\nactual transmitter, who remains reliable regardless of whether his addition is\naccepted or rejected. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this particular scenario, we are looking at a narrator that\nhas been accused of tampering with the text. In other words, this is not a case\nwhere the rules of <em>ziy\u0101dat al-thiqa<\/em> (the additions of trustworthy\nnarrators) come into play. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Possibility #3<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color\">\u201cEven if we accept that this addition from Saduq is not\nfound in the original hadith, but rather, it is something he added, then this\nwould still be considered a non-issue, for it is an addition that is a tafseer\nfor the narration. We understand from the narration that it is recommended to\nsay the names of the Imams one by one during the supplication (dua). Saduq\nsimply made clear the narration and made clear what is to be said in the dua.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not reasonable to assume that such a matter can be\nreferred to as a mere <em>tafs\u012br<\/em>. Rather, the words in the original <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em>\nwere taken out and others were added in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the original <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em> states, \u201cMu\u1e25ammad is my\nprophet and that `Al\u012b and so-and-so are my Im\u0101ms\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this were a mere <em>tafs\u012br<\/em>, Ibn B\u0101bawayh would have reworded it as, \u201cMu\u1e25ammad is my prophet and that `Al\u012b <strong>and so-and-so are Im\u0101ms. Meaning:<\/strong> al-\u1e24asan, al-\u1e24usayn, `Al\u012b bin al-\u1e24usayn, Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b, Ja`far bin Mu\u1e25ammad, M\u016bs\u0101 bin Ja`far, `Al\u012b bin M\u016bs\u0101, Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b, `Al\u012b bin Mu\u1e25ammad, al-\u1e24asan bin `Al\u012b, and Allah\u2019s proof, the son of al-\u1e24asan bin `Al\u012b.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, instead, Ibn B\u0101bawayh, removes the words,\n\u201cso-and-so,\u201d and does not include the term, \u201cmeaning,\u201d in order to express that\nthis is an interpretation. Commentaries do not require a replacement of text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, these\nactions by Ibn B\u0101bawayh were not seen as a mere commentary by Sh\u012ba scholars. Rather, these words were taken as\nthe words of M\u016bs\u0101 bin Ja`far verbatim. One example of this is the Grand\nAyatollah Jaw\u0101d Al-Tabr\u012bz\u012b, who in his treatise of authentic reports of the\nappointment of the Im\u0101ms, only found two examples of \u201cauthentic\u201d narrations that\nlisted the names of the Im\u0101ms in full. One of these two reports was this\nnarration by Ibn B\u0101bawayh.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a> Al-Tabr\u012bz\u012b cannot be blamed for this\nmistake, for there is no indication in the report that this is a mere\ncommentary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Sh. A\u1e25mad\u2019s\nexcuse that \u201cSaduq simply made clear the narration and made clear what\nis to be said in the dua.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say: Do the Twelvers not know who the Twelve Imams were?\nCouldn\u2019t Ibn B\u0101bawayh include their names after the narration instead of\nreplacing words within the narration? This action alone causes us to have\ndoubts in regards to the integrity of Ibn B\u0101bawayh, and through his other seven\nmanipulations that have to do with naming the Im\u0101ms and specifying their\nnumber, we become certain that this action was indeed intentional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sh. A\u1e25mad seems to be overlooking the fact that this\n\u201ccommentary\u201d has severe ideological consequences. Perhaps he would have been\nmore aware of this if the commentator was an Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl\u012b, W\u0101qif\u012b, or Fa\u1e6d\u1e25\u012b, who\ninstead substituted the ambiguous \u201cso-and-so\u201d with his own preferred list of\nIm\u0101ms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Possibility #4<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color\">\u201cAnd if this person\nwho\u2019s bringing the accusation rejects all this and still considers this\naddition a distortion, then his accusation against Saduq is nothing more but an\nassumption and conjecture, for it is very possible that the distorter (if for\nthe argument\u2019s sake if we say there has taken place distortion [sic]) was other\nthan him. This is because Saduq did not take this hadith from Kulayni as the\naccuser falsely imagined, but rather, he took this narration from another\nperson (Muhammad Ibn Ali Majulwayh).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This objection is the\nonly reasonable one that has been made and my answer is a simple one. There is\na pattern which leads us to dismissing the possibility that the manipulation\ncame from Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b M\u0101jil\u016byah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the forty\nmanipulated narrations that I have stumbled upon, only five of them come\nthrough the path of Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b M\u0101jil\u016byah. These are reports #2, #11, #12, #25, #32. Even if we were to assume\nthat all of these five were manipulated by Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b M\u0101jil\u016byah, what are we going to do with the other reports?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is known that the methodology\nof the scholars of <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em> is point to the biggest culprit in the chain.\nIf the chain consists of a liar, a weak narrator, and a reliable narrator, the \u1e25ad\u012bthist\nwill accuse the liar, even though it is possible that the weak narrator made a\nmistake. If the liar wasn\u2019t present, the \u1e25ad\u012bthist would accuse the weak\nnarrator, even though it is entirely possible as well that the reliable\nnarrator made a mistake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that being said, Ibn B\u0101bawayh is the lowest common denominator who keeps ending up at the scene of the crime. \u00a0The only time that Mu\u1e25ammad bin `Al\u012b M\u0101jil\u016byah is found at the scene is when Ibn B\u0101bawayh is there with him. Therefore, it is likelier for Ibn B\u0101bawayh to be the culprit in all of these cases than for there to be a different culprit in each case, while absolving Ibn B\u0101bawayh. I have made this point very clear early on in \u201cDistortions of al-\u1e62ad\u016bq\u201d (p. 15) and the chances of Ibn B\u0101bawayh never manipulating a <em>\u1e25ad\u012bth<\/em> is astronomically low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Distortions of al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to\ndeflect the accusation against Ibn B\u0101bawayh, Sh. A\u1e25mad included an example of\nan alternative wording found in \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b. By this, he is arguing that\nif Ibn B\u0101bawayh manipulated a report, then you should say the same about al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the accusation leveled against al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b has no bearing on the accusation against Ibn B\u0101bawayh. If al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b was a dishonest manipulator of the narrations of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , then we would discard him in the same way we would discard any lying narrator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I will\nnot be responding to this criticism in this article, but will have to leave it\nfor another article, in order to not detract from the original topic: the\nreliability of Ibn B\u0101bawayh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Conclusion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sh. A\u1e25mad\u2019s excuses\nfor Ibn B\u0101bawayh are not reasonable. Had it not been for the ideological\nsignificance of these distortions or the sheer number of occurrences, it may\nhave been possible to dismiss these as innocent additions. Unfortunately for\nIbn B\u0101bawayh, the sinister nature of this manipulation is obvious, even in this\nisolated case, let alone when going through his track record of other\nmanipulations that I have collected in the book. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, all we can do after presenting these proofs is to call onto Allah the Almighty, asking Him to guide Sh.
