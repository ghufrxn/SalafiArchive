Even though our website does not often deal with such topics, however, we have made an exception this time around in order to expose scholars like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/sayed-mahdi-almodarresi\/arbaeen-pilgrimage_b_6203756.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Mahdi Modarrassi <\/a>who is either dishonest to his followers, or is too gullible for his turban.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The official governmental resources, the Shia Institutions, and two-faced media and of the Shia Persian Government proclaim and assure that the number of visitors (to Karbala\u2019a) in this year\u2019s Arbaeen anniversary reached seventeen million people! Of course, many ignorant people happily accepted this figure!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Let\u2019s take a deep look on these claims logically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">All statistics agree that the Iraqi population is around 29 million (taking into consideration that one million were killed in military fight from 2003 till now). And when we take into consideration that three million Iraqi are refugees outside Iraq, the real number decreases to 26 million. And when we extract the number of non-Muslims, like Christians, Yazeedis, and Sabians, we reach the number of 25 million Muslim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Now, let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that Shias represent 60% of the Iraqi population and the Sunni\u2019s represent 40%. Actually, let\u2019s say the Shias represent 65% and Sunnis represent 35%; then, this means that the number of Shias in Iraq is 16.25 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Based on this number, there are three categories of Shias who cannot visit karbala\u2019a on the Arbaeen: Young kids, the elderly, and sick people. The international figures state that 38% of Iraqis are under 14 years old; while 3% are above 64 years old. Thus, we can presume that 15% of the Shia Iraqis are under 14 meaning that they will not be able to attend this ceremony. Their number is 2.4 million. The mothers of these children will not visit the city as they have to look after them. Hypothetically speaking, there are two kids under five years old per family, then 1.2 million women were not able to make it. Let\u2019s also assume that 2% (of Iraqis) are from the elderly, which constitute 325,000 people at least. Furthermore, there is the number of sick people in hospitals and houses, and the total number is around 4.5 million Shias who are prevented from attending. In addition, we have to add a number of 750,000 Shias that represents the Shias in different security sectors (i.e the army, police, and other institutions, etc\u2026); this increases the number to 5.25 million. Also,if we add pregnant, menstruating, and confined women, then the number ups to 6 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">This means that if every adult Shia, capable of walking, goes to Karbala to celebrate the Arbaeen; the number will be 10.5 million. If we then add a number of 300,000 foreign Arab visitors, according to the official Iraqi departments; the total number will be 11 million. Now, where did that extra six million visitors come from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">As for the hotels, the official resources assure that the number of hotels that were able to receive clients is 400 hotels. Hypothetically speaking, the average capacity of each hotel is 100 people; the overall number is 40,000 people. Where did the rest go? 50 schools were opened to receive visitors. Around 500 people in each school, the number is 25,000 people. Let\u2019s also assume that 1000 family received visitors in their own houses; 10 people in each. The number is 10,000 people. The overall number is 75,000 people. Let\u2019s say 100,000 visitors had a residence. Where did the other millions reside?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Regarding the sewage and sanitary drainage, we all know that Karbala was sunk in water the last time it rained, which means that the sewage infrastructure has not been rehabilitated since the toppling of the previous regime. Let\u2019s assume that 17 million people have to urinate three times per day, and that every individual urinates around one liter of fluids. That would mean that there is fifty million liters of fluids that pass by Karbala\u2019s sewage every day. This number is five times more than the amount of water that passed by the sewage during rainy days. Shall we continue and discuss the eight million kilograms of other bodily excrements as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below is some photos of the rubbish &amp; waste &#8220;management system&#8221; in <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/01\/29\/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Karbala<\/a>.

The engineer Ibrahim al-Zoubaydi provided us with an illustrated map in which he explains, in an intellectual manner, the capacity of the area that surrounds al-Husayn\u2019s grave. We can see, based on this map, that the total area filled by visitors does not exceed 500 thousand m<sup>2<\/sup>; let\u2019s presume that each person needs a space of 0.5m to stand, let alone lay down, this mean that this area cannot be filled with more than one million people if we placed people in rows one after the other. Anyway, we already know that Karbala is not a plain land, but that it is settled. This means that this city cannot, in its best conditions, have capacity for more than 500,000 people from the visitors who came from outside Karbala to perform the ceremonies of the Arbaeen visit. Since we haven\u2019t seen any long queues or a large number of crowds in the city\u2019s entry sides because there is no place to stand on near to the grave, nor have we seen a state of confusion and disturbance due to the over-crowdedness, then we can say that the real number of visitors did not reach more than half a million people. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Let\u2019s be more rational please. The entire area of settled Mecca is 88 km<sup>2<\/sup>, while the central area that surrounds the Mosque is of 6km<sup>2<\/sup>. This area is ten times more the area of Karbala. We all know the crowdedness in Mecca when it welcomes around two million pilgrims in this area though it is equipped with a huge number of hotels and apartment buildings. Now the question is: How can we put 17 million people in an area that constitutes 1\/6th the area of Mecca? And here, we are not trying to compare Mecca, this holy city, with any other place on the earth. According to retired and sick minds only, you can put 100 million people per 1 m<sup>2<\/sup>\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3547\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/karbala_area.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3547\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/karbala_area.jpg\" alt=\"Karbala Area\" width=\"450\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/karbala_area.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/karbala_area-300x251.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">700m x 700m Area of Karbala<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The research team of twelvershia.net has looked into the <a href=\"http:\/\/booking.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\">booking.com<\/a> website in order to verify some of the criticisms mentioned by the author of the article and we suggest that readers do the same.

So when you read on Shia propaganda outlets like &#8220;The Shia Post&#8221; titles like these &#8220;Number of Arbaeen pilgrims in Iraq exceeds 26 Million&#8221; Then know O dear reader that these folks are shameless liars who live in delusions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">UPDATE:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After cornering the Shia with clear evidence, they shifted their arguments and began to say:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A- No, we don&#8217;t mean that 20 million people were gathered in Arbaeen at once. Rather, it is during the period of all 40 days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond: In that case you&#8217;re dividing the alleged 20 million by a 40 days and thus we&#8217;re ending up with around 500,000 people in the city at one time. Hardly, the &#8220;largest gathering in the world&#8221; as you exaggerators claim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- No, the 20 million were not all in the city at once. Rather, most of them were on the road between Najaf and Karbala&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond: Similar to the above, this means the people were not gathered in the city. Thus by default your claim of\u00a0&#8220;largest gathering in the world&#8221; is refuted. However, we will go a step beyond as always and calculate the numbers for you to show you that this lie is a mathematical impossibility.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below are images of the Najaf-Karbala&#8217; entrances\u00a0and the Karbala&#8217;-Najaf entrance on the day of Arbaeen:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3569\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"najaf-karbala-entrance\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Najaf-Karbala-entrance-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3570 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"karbala-najaf-entrance\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Karbala-Najaf-entrance-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Najaf to Karbala&#8217; is a 75 km long road, this road is about 10 m long in its width, giving a total area of 750.000 m2. If we take a crowd density of 1 person per m2 (which is too generous), it produces\u00a00.75 million people. Let&#8217;s also factor in\u00a0the road from Baghdad, which is 100 km to Karbala&#8217; thus giving\u00a0another million. Add the road from Hilla to it too, which gives another 50 km and an additional half a million people, you still get only a total of 2.25 million people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, if we take the area of two shrines and whatever is between, that area is about 85,000 m2. Regarding crowd densities, it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to get a crowd density of over 9 people per square meter, which is what you see sometimes in Japan when they squeeze people into a full train. So if we remove the two shrines and all the trees and obstacles\u00a0then level everything and pack the people on those two squares and between you would end up with another 0.75 million people. Unless these shrines have ten floors (they don&#8217;t)\u00a0you could physically speaking never even reach a million on the gathering place itself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You see dear reader, with even the most ridiculous assumptions, filling from the north the entire road from Baghdad to Karbala, from the east the entire road from Hilla to Karbala, and filling from the south the entire road from Najaf to Karbala and absolutely packing the area of the two shrines with people and we\u00a0still can&#8217;t get past the 3 million!\u00a0Refer to the satellite images\u00a0above to see that the road from Najaf&#8217;s side leading to Karbala&#8217; is almost empty. Whereas the entrance to Karbala&#8217; from Najaf seems active\u00a0but is nowhere near being fully packed (large gaps between crowd).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind,\u00a0Karbala has less than ten entrances to the city. That means that if you want to accommodate an influx of 23 million people on a day, then assuming ten entrances, through EACH ENTRANCE would have to pass more than 25 people EVERY SINGLE SECOND for the ENTIRE 24 HOURS of that day!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May God further expose the extremists\u00a0and exaggerator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Arbaeen: Number of Visitors The following article about the Arbaeen was originally written in Arabic by Ahmad Al-Hasani, but was translated for twelvershia.net.
