In this short article, we will take a look at how Ali was included in <em>Al-Mi\u2019raj<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The article includes the following narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">In the book <em>Kashf al-Ghummah,<\/em> it has been narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar that: \u201cI heard someone ask the Prophet of Allah (SWT), `With what voice did Allah, the Glorified and High, speak to you in on the night of Mi\u2019raj?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The Prophet replied, \u201c<strong><u>My Lord spoke to me with the voice of `Ali bin Abi Talib (a.s.)<\/u><\/strong> and said, `O\u2019 Ahmad! I am an Entity that is not like anything else. I can not be compared to anything else and I know all the secrets of your heart. With the exception of `Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.), you have no other close friend. Thus, I speak to you with the voice of `Ali bin Abi Talib (a. s.) so that your heart will be at ease.\u201d\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our criticisms:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; The extreme exaggerations by those that ascribe themselves to the teachings of Ali bin Abi Talib were once again victorious at making Ali the center of attention of another important Islamic event. Lies continuously have encompassed the Shia sect, to the extent that its followers have grown accustomed to seeing Ali portrayed as a demi-god.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Upon returning to the source, \u201cKashf Al-Ghummah\u201d, we have found that this narration is from \u201cAl-Manaqib\u201d by Al-Khawarizmi. The narration is numbered #61 in the latter book, and it is weak according to both Sunnis and Shias, for the narrator Lut bin Yahya wasn\u2019t even born to have heard from Ibn Umar. See Lut\u2019s biography in Mizan Al-I\u2019itidal. Furthermore, it is not reasonable for one to believe that Ibn Umar would utter such a narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; The translator omitted a section of the translation. The Arabic text includes an attribution to Allah in which He says to the Prophet (peace be upon him):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u062e\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642\u062a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u0627\u0637\u0644\u0639\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0643 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u062c\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0643 \u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The correct translation: \u201cI created you from my light and created Ali from your light, and I looked into the depths of your heart and found that you do not love anyone as much as you love Ali.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The translator, Saleem Bhimji, translated \u201cyou do not love anyone as much as you love Ali,\u201d to \u201cwith the exception of `Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.), you have no other close friend.\u201d It seems that this was done in order to elevate the status of Ali since the Prophet (peace be upon him) did have other close friends.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, Saleem Bhimji, completely omitted, \u201cI created you from my light and created Ali from your light.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have not arrived at a definite conclusion as to why Saleem Bhimji would omit these words. We furthermore contacted him via Twitter (@almubin), where he stated that he is away from the original text and needs a few months to returns to check it before making corrections. He also said that he was sure that the text that he translated did not contain the words \u201cI created you from my light and created Ali from your light,\u201d since his copy did not seem to be an academically edited copy. However, it is indicated on al-islam.org that he had translated the academically edited work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah knows his intentions and will judge him accordingly if he cheated his readers. If not, then he is just another incompetent translator that was given control of a publishing house.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article, entitled: \u201cMi\u2019raj, the Night Ascension\u201d, originally a section from Al-Faidh Al-Kashani\u2019s \u201cNawadir Al-Akhbar\u201d, was translated by Saleem Bhimji, the Director at the Islamic Publishing House.
