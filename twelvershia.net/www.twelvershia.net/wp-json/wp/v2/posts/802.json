Hassan ibn Thabit, the famous poet of the Holy Prophet, composed a poem and recited it before the audience, in which he said:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">The Prophet then said to him: &#8220;Stand up, O Ali, As I am pleased to make you Imam and Guide after me.&#8221;<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We answer by saying: No one who heard the sermon of Ghadeer from among the companions understood that this was an appointment of a leader. The Shia&#8217;s understanding of this event has been refuted in detail on many websites and in many books, so no need to go through that again, but to simplify the matter more, we say that some companions complained to the prophet (saw) about `Ali&#8217;s (ra) actions and decisions during the expedition to Yemen, the Prophet (saw) got angry and delivered a sermon at Ghadeer telling them: That whoever loves, befriends, and supports him must also do the same for `Ali (ra). Then he says that he is leaving two weighty, heavy burdens, one being the Qur&#8217;an, the other are his family members. This is all there is to know about the sermon of Ghadeer Khum and it is very natural for a deviated sect of extremists such as the Imami Twelver Shia to sanctify this event and make it holy, they even have a yearly celebration called `Eid-e-Ghadeer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the word Mawla, anyone with the slightest understanding of Arabic knows that the Arabs at the time and at the head of them the prophet (saw) wouldn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;Mawla&#8221; to refer to leaders, instead if one were to gather ALL narrations in which the Prophet (saw) talks about political leaders, he refers to them as one of several terms: &#8220;Imam, Ameer, Khalifah, Ulil-Amr, Sultan.&#8221; These are VERY clear terms that no one can argue with and they are the ones mainly used to talk about leadership. As for those who are familiar with the language of the Arabs they know for a fact the the word Mawla and Muwalat are almost always used in two meanings: To talk about a person who is your servant OR to talk about an ally or beloved companion, close friend and supporter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s leave all of this and return to the claim made by the Shia above.\u00a0These words attributed to Hassaan ibn Thabit (ra) have no Sanad or chain of transmission in the Sunni books. There is one chain though in the book of\u00a0Muhammad ibn Imran al-Mirzabani, but he is Mu`tazili, not Sunni.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sources:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.

Waly. The various forms of this root-word and its derivatives are the most oft-recurring words in the Holy Qur&#8217;an. It is said that they have been used 124 times in the form of a noun and 112 times in the form of a verb \u2026 The original meaning of this root-word as mentioned by Raghib in his lexicon &#8220;Mufradatul Qur&#8217;an&#8221; is one thing taking place by the side of another in such a way that there is no distance between them i.e. if two things are placed side by side in such a manner that there is no other thing between them the root-word &#8216;Waly&#8217; is used \u2026 That is why this root-word is naturally used for nearness and proximity also, both physical and figurative. And again for this very reason it has been used in the sense of friendship, love, patronage, guardianship, control etc., because all these conceptions involve some sort of contact and proximity \u2026 A number of meanings have been given for this root word and its derivatives. For example, some 27 meanings of the word Mawla have been given. It is obvious that originally it was not coined for all of them and could not have more than one original meaning. Other meanings are to be obtained from contextual indications.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: Master and Mastership, p. 1<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now your scholar has clearly mentioned that basically, the word meant nearness, and the other meanings are to be obtained from contextual indications.

The people of Mecca and Yemen who didn&#8217;t go along the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) after finishing the final pilgrimage were not present. This is a clear and conclusive proof that Ali was not being declared Imam at Ghadeer Khum.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. The very word Mawla, the root word of which basically means nearness, shows that the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) didn&#8217;t intend to declare Ali the Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. The version &#8216;O Allah befriend him whoever befriends him (i.e Ali), and be his enemy whoever has enmity with him (i.e Ali)&#8217; shows that the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) didn&#8217;t intend to declare Ali the Imam. Because the root word of (\u0648\u0627\u0644) which is always translated here as &#8216;to befriend&#8217; is the same as the root word of Mawla. And secondly, friendship is the opposite of enmity, not leadership. So the perfect translation of this complete tradition looks correct when we translate Mawla as friend.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Whosoever considers me his friend, he should consider Ali as his friend. O Allah, befriend him whoever befriends him (i.e Ali), and be enemy of anyone who has enmity to Ali.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. We don&#8217;t find in the books of Ahlus Sunnah that Ali (ra) ever considered the incident of Ghadeer to be the proof of his Imamate. If this was indeed an announcement of the Imamate of Ali, then Ali (ra) would have mentioned it on many occasions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These realities makes us realize that the incident of Ghadeer Khum was not the announcement of the Imamate of Ali, but it was the announcement of the Wilayah of Ali (in the sense that Ali has a close relation to Allah and the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645), just like the Awliya of Allah. This made it clear that no one had the option to hate Ali or to show enmity towards him). It was not an announcement of divine Imamate concept of Shias, according to which the one who holds it is similar to a prophet in appointment, and has the same powers like prophets, so much so that the major Shia scholar, Mulla Baqir Majlisi gets confused on the differences between Imams and the Prophets, as he says in his book:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0644\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0629<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[To our knowledge there is no reason not to describe the Imams as Prophets except consideration to the status of the Final Prophet.
