As all Muslims know, the known and popular Kalima among Muslims is &#8220;I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, And Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&#8221; (Narrated by Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2484 and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2015\/01\/11\/abu-huraira\/\">Abu Huraira<\/a> in Saheeh Muslim #27) The Shia Kalima includes the following words &#8220;`Ali yun Waliyullah&#8221; or &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the friend of Allah.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The difference between the Sunni Kalima and the Shia Kalima is that the former can be found in the Qur&#8217;an, we find {There is no god except Allah} in Qur&#8217;an [Surat Muhammad, verse 19] and we find {Muhammad is the Messenger of God} in Qur&#8217;an [Surat-ul-Fath, verse 29].<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the words &#8220;`Ali is God&#8217;s friend&#8221; are nowhere in the Qur&#8217;an. That&#8217;s their first flaw with the Shia Kalima. To fix this problem, Shia will take a general verse talking about the obedient believers who establish prayer and give charity [Qur&#8217;an 5:55] then claim that the word &#8220;believers&#8221; is &#8220;`Ali&#8221;. This is a weak opinion that relies on fabricated narrations none of which are authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only is the Shia Kalima not in the Qur&#8217;an, but the narrations they use to twist the interpretation of the above verse are all weak and unreliable. This is their second failure and defeat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Shia Kalima in the Call to Prayer<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that we are done discussing the testimony of faith, and after we showed that the Sunni testimony of faith (Kalima) or as it is referred to &#8220;al-Shahadatayn&#8221; is a part of the Qur&#8217;an whereas the third testimony added by the Shia Kalima is nowhere in God&#8217;s book, we turn our attention to the Islamic call of prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia insist on adding the Shia Kalima to the call to prayer (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UztMkUqjskc\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Adhan<\/a>) and at the beginning of every prayer (Iqamah). The Shia attack all those who disagree with them and stubbornly alter the common and mass transmitted texts of the Adhan and Iqamah by inserting &#8220;`Ali-yun\u00a0Waliyullah&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is something the Shia of our days may not know, is that their ancestors, as well as the eleven Imams (excluding the fictional one), have never added the words &#8220;`Ali-yun\u00a0Waliyullah&#8221; to the Adhan or Iqamah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, let&#8217;s see what the Imams of the Shia said in their authentic narrations as is found in the main books:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064f\u0639\u0652\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064d \u0639 \u064a\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e \u062b\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062b\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651 \u0630\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u062b\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064e \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u0627\u064b<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ali bin Ibrahim with his chain to aba Ja`far (as) reports: &#8220;The Adhan and the Iqamah have 35 parts, he counted by his hand one by one, the Adhan had 18 parts and the Iqamah 17 parts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: al-Kafi 3\/302.
