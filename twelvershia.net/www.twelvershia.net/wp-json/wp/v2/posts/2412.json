Their problem is that they think bravery is to kill people in Jihad and if someone couldn\u2019t kill with his power than he is not brave. And hence, they conclude, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar were not brave. If that is the case then people like Pharaoh, Nimrod, Stalin and all the mass murderers would have to be listed at the top of all the braves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among the believers Bara bin Malik al-Ansari on his\u00a0own killed one hundred men besides those whom he killed with the help of others. Hamza, Abu Dujanah al-Ansari, \u2018Aasim bin Thabit, Talha, Zubair, Sa\u2019d were all known for their specialty in tackling the enemy. But no one prefers them over \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib or over Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, may Allah be well pleased with them all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once a person presents himself to face the enemy he is proven to be a brave one regardless of how much of them he could kill or defeat. Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, never missed any battle with the Prophet (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) and they were seen defending the Prophet (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) during harsh conditions especially in Uhud and Hunain. How could such a person be cowardly? If it is just because there is hardly any narration describing how they killed a Mushrik during battle then what could be the response regarding the Prophet (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) who never killed anyone in battle except Ubayy bin Khalaf? If they say that the Prophet (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) was the bravest but he was a leader and hence did not get involved in fighting then we shall let \u2018Ali (ra) falsify this claim. Hence Imam Ahmad records in Musnad (1042), Abu Ya\u2019la (302, 412) and others with an authentic Isnad through Abu Ishaq from Harithah bin Mudharrib that \u2018Ali said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0633\u064f \u064a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e \u0628\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0631\u064d \u0627\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0642\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0634\u064e\u062f\u0651\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0650\u060c \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u2013 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652: \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652 \u2013 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c \u0623\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWhen the fighting grew intense on the day of Badr we sought shelter by drawing closer to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam), who was one of the strongest of men, and nobody was closer to the (army of the) disbelievers than him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We see that during the harsh time even brave like \u2018Ali (ra) used to seek shelter with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) but still he did not kill anyone except Ubayy. (A man with bad intentions may even claim that `Ali is cowardly since he hid behind his cousin in battle and we are sure the Shia would have made this claim if the speaker was`Umar)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what is bravery? Let us look at the meaning of Shaja\u2019ah [Arabic of bravery] in Arabic dictionary. Al-Jawhari says in \u201cAs-Sihaah\u201d (3\/1235):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u0634\u062f\u0651\u064e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0623\u0633<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIt is the stability of heart during trial.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the English word bravery means \u2018able or ready to face and endure danger, disgrace or pain\u2019. So not being able to kill someone or not being able to conquer some place does not indicate cowardice. Indeed, those who were killed by \u2018Ali during the battles were more than those who were killed by Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar. But it only proves that \u2018Ali encountered more famous combatants than them not that they were hiding for their life. (Since usually the deaths of famous men are much more likely to be recorded in books than the death of random soldiers)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for running away from battles, then there is no indication that any of the two Shaikhs left the battle field. There were two incidents in Prophetic history when Muslims ran from the battle field when they couldn\u2019t handle the enemies\u2019 fierce attack. But in none of them, with any shred of evidence, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar left the battle field. So called proofs which some Shia authors quote to prove that they ran away from the battlefield are nothing but sheer misrepresentation of the context. If Allah willed I will compile a refutation on such arguments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following passage I translated from Minhaj as-Sunnah (8\/87-89) of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah who quoted \u2018Allamah Ibn Hazm from \u201cAl-Fisal\u201d (4\/107).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Translation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Hazm said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We see that they claim that \u2018Ali was the greatest in waging Jihad against disbelievers and attacking and fighting them among all the companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Muhammad (Ibn Hazm) said: This is wrong as the Jihad is classified in three categories;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of them is calling towards Allah,<\/li>\n<li>Second is to do Jihad during war by ideas and strategies<\/li>\n<li>And the third is to do jihad with hands by killing and hitting.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We find that with regards to the first type of Jihad no person superseded Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar after the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam). As for Abu Bakr then we find that the senior companions accepted Islam on his hands. As compared to him, \u2018Ali does not have much share in this. As for \u2018Umar then we see that the day he became Muslim, Islam was strengthened and the worship of Allah was being done openly. This is the greatest Jihad and these two persons were alone in such Jihad of the first two categories (during early days) which has no equal\u00a0and \u2018Ali does not have participation in it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With regards to the second category then we find that it is specifically for Abu Bakr and then for \u2018Umar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the third category which is stabbing, hitting and combating then we find that it is the lowest level of Jihad because of the obvious reason that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam), with the agreement of Muslims, was selective in doing the most virtuous of actions\u00a0and we see that his \u2013 may Allah sends <em>Salaat<\/em> and salutation upon him \u2013 Jihad in most of the cases was restricted within the first two categories which is to call towards Allah \u2013 the Mighty and Majestic \u2013 and planning and forwarding. His least involvement (among the three categories) was in stabbing, hitting and combating. This is not because of cowardice but in reality he was absolutely the bravest of all earthly beings with his hands and soul and the most complete to attain succor. But he would look for the best and then next after it from the acts, and then he would prefer it and get involved with it. We find that, during Badr and other battles, Abu Bakr would not leave him and sometimes even \u2018Umar was included in it. They were distinguished in this case unlike \u2018Ali and all other companions, except in rare cases.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then after that we ponder over the third category of Jihad which is to stab, to hit and to combat. We see that \u2018Ali was not alone in this, but many other companions also had the same share like Talha, Zubair and Sa\u2019d and those martyred\u00a0in early Islam like Hamza, \u2018Ubaidah bin Harith and Mus\u2019ab bin \u2018Umair, and from Ansar Sa\u2019d bin Mu\u2019adh, Simak bin Kharshah, Abu Dujanah and others. Also Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar do have a good share in it even if they did not get involved in it like these people which is because of their participation in a better Jihad in association with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam) and to aid him during battles. And he sent them for war more than he sent \u2018Ali. He sent Abu Bakr towards Bani Fazarah and elsewhere and he sent \u2018Umar towards Bani Fulan. On the other hand we do not know \u2018Ali was sent for any battle except at a\u00a0fort of Khaibar which he conquered [and he had sent Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar there, before \u2018Ali, but they could not conquered it].

I followed `Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), \u201cWhat is wrong with the people(fleeing)?\u201d He replied, \u201cThis is the Will of Allah,\u201d After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, \u201cAnyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils.\u201d [Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 53, Hadith 370]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This narration does not state that `Umar (ra) ran away, it states that the Muslims were defeated and a group of them retreated, the narrator simply asks `Umar (ra) what&#8217;s going on and he answers him that victory and defeat are by the will of Allah.

By Allah, what shocked us most were their soldiers who attacked us all at once, and the\u00a0people (Muslims) were defeated in retreat, so the Prophet (saw) went to the right and shouted: \u201cO\u00a0people, come to me, I am Rasul-Allah, I am Muhammad ibn `Abdillah.\u201d But the camels were pushing and\u00a0shoving against one another, and the people were running, except that with Rasul-Allah (saw) was a\u00a0group from the Mouhajiroun, the Ansar, and his household but they were not many. From those who held their positions with him were Abu Bakr and `Umar, and from his household was `Ali and `Abbas and\u00a0his son al-Fadl bin `Abbas as well as abu Sufiyan bin al-Harith and Rabi`ah bin al-Harith, and Ayman bin\u00a0`Ubayd who was the son of Umm Ayman, and Usamah ibn Zayd; also a man from Hawazin on his white\u00a0camel holding a black banner whose tip ended with a sharp spear.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The report is authentic and Ibn Ishaq declares hearing from `Asim at the end of the report in Musnad Ahmad, he also declares hearing from another authentic chain in Dala&#8217;il al-Nubuwwah by al-Bayhaqi where Ahmad ibn`Abdul-Jabbar narrates from Yunus bin Bukayr from the book of Ibn Ishaq and this chain is authenticated by the experts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So as we can clearly see from the authentic texts a group from the Mouhajirun and the Ansar remained with the Prophet peace be upon him\u00a0and amongst them were Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar may Allah be pleased with them, and not only did `Umar (ra) fight but he also received two female captives as recorded in Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrated Nafi`: `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Apostle!
