Part 1."},"content":{"rendered":"<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/imgstore.org\/a\/67hxw0egsgub?i=857\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following is a response to the article on ShiaPen entitled:\u00a0<strong>Who Believes the Qur\u2019an has been a Victim of Tahreef? Part 1: The Shia Position, which can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shiapen.com\/comprehensive\/tahreef.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lengthy article by ShiaPen, formerly known as Answering-Ansar, is one of the most comprehensive studies from a Shia perspective on the matter of Tahreef. For years, it has been quoted over and over again in other articles, forums, and social media. By the grace of Allah, this refutation to their article will respond to the points raised by ShiaPen, clear misconceptions, and answer the questions that have been asked by readers throughout the years. Due to the length of the article, we will be splitting it into two parts. The first will focus on the Shia position regarding the opinion of the fabrication that took place with the Qur\u2019an, and the second will focus on defending the Sunni position, and that they did not hold this view.<br \/>\nIn the preface, ShiaPen bring up three points:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">1- First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 2- Second Point: One cannot accuse an author of ascribing to Tahreef because he recorded such traditions in his book<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 3- Third Point: It is unjust to attribute the belief of an individual to that of an entire same sect<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are in agreement with ShiaPen on the second and third point since these points are fair. However, we have an issue with the first point. ShiaPen themselves are aware that there are Shia Ulema who have viewed their books as authentic. If we go to Chapter 5 of the article, we find ShiaPen quoting Al-Shaikh Al-Bahboodi, the author of Saheeh Al-Kafi. So, how is it that ShiaPen can claim that no scholar has written such a book when they themselves quote from one of the Saheeh Shia books?! Furthermore, the Twelver Shia Akhbari sect as a whole believes in the authenticity of everything in those early books like Al-Kafi and Al-Faqeeh. Al-Hurr Al-Amili aggressively argues that the narrations in those books are all authentic, and spends twenty six pages arguing for this opinion. In other words, such an opinion cannot be dismissed in its entirety. In other words, if one were to quote a narration from one of those books to the Akhbari, then it is binding upon them. As for the Usoolis, then they are obligated to look up the authenticity of that specific narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen then outlined the reasons as to why a narration, even if authentic, is still to be rejected:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The scholars have mentioned the following arguments in order to support their stance:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 1. It is proved from authentic and Mutawatir sources that Quran had already been complied during the time of Holy Prophet (s) and hadiths which shows distortion in Quran are in opposition to this fact. Such hadiths being in contradiction to the cited fact is itself a proof that such hadiths have been fabricated.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 2. Such hadiths are in contradiction to the following verse of Holy Quran: \u201cCertainly We revealed the Reminder and certainly We shall preserve it.\u201d (The Holy Qur\u2019an 15: 9) and the hadith which is in contradiction to Quran is to be thrown away.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 3. These hadiths which show distortion in Quran are very less in number while the hadiths which shows Quran being protected from distortion are Mutawatur and prominent, moreover these hadiths are strong in respect of arguments and proof as compared to the former.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 4. Hadiths which shows distortion in Quran are very scarce, whereas the verses of Quran being actually Quranic can be proved from authentic and confirmed hadiths. Therefore the verses which such hadiths claimed to be Quranic or being part of Quran in fact do not prove so. How can Shia Ulema rely on these doubtful hadiths while some of the Shia Ulema have advanced the view that reports narrated from single source do not have the capability of being proof and even if we uphold the their authority then singularly narrated report can be a proof in only such a situation where it is useful to be practiced at the required place\/time specially we cannot rely on singularly narrated reports in respect of \u2018beliefs\u2019 due to the fact the belief are maintained on the basis of knowledge and certainty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These opinions would be fine if the narrations were really as rare and few as ShiaPen make them out to be. Al-Majlisi, in his commentary on Al-Kafi\u2019s hadith that the Qur\u2019an was originally seventeen thousand verses, in Mir&#8217;aat al-`Uqoul comments:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0641\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0642\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0639\u0646\u062f\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649<br \/>\n[The narration is authentic, and it is clear that this narration and many of the authentic narrations are clear that the Qur\u2019an has been shortened and changed, and I hold that the narrations of this meaning are Mutawatir in meaning.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Shaykh al-Mufid writes in Awa&#8217;il al-Maqalaat page 80:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u062c\u0627\u0621\u062a \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0641\u064a\u0636\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f (\u0635)\u060c \u0628\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0630\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0635\u0627\u0646<br \/>\n[A huge amount of narrations have reached us from the Imams of guidance from Aal-Muhammad (saws), about the difference in the Qur&#8217;an and what some of the oppressors did to it from deletions and additions.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This opinion is supported by Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi\u2019s compilation in which he collected over a thousand Shia reports that suggest that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with. So, the opinion by ShiaPen these narrations are few in number is a gross understatement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: The term Mutawatir means that the narrations are so major in number that they cannot be denied.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the verse: {Certainly We revealed the Reminder and certainly We shall preserve it.} (The Holy Qur\u2019an 15: 9)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This can easily be interpreted by those Shia that believe in the corruption of the Qur\u2019an to mean that it has been preserved in the hearts of the Imams, and is currently with the Mahdi, for the corruption of the book in the hands of some does not mean that the Qur\u2019an is not preserved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As an example, the Shia leader and philosopher al-Shaykh al-Mufid (d.413 hijri)\u00a0when asked about the Qur&#8217;an in\u00a0al-Masa&#8217;il al-Sarawiyah page 78 &#8211; the ninth issue:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[There is no doubt, that what is between the two covers of the Quran, its whole content is Allah\u2019s words and revelation (1), there is nothing from the words of mankind in it and it is the majority of the revelation (2).<br \/>\nAnd the rest of what was revealed by Allah most high is with the guardian of Shari`ah, the preserver of Ahkaam, none of it was lost (3). Although the one who has gathered what is found between the two covers today (4), has not included it along with what he collected (5) for some reasons that caused him to do so, such as:<br \/>\nHis inability to know parts of it.<br \/>\nAnd: His doubt and uncertainty concerning it.<br \/>\nAnd: What he purposely kept out of it. (6)<br \/>\nAmeer al-Mu&#8217;mineen (as) had gathered the revealed Qur&#8217;an from beginning to end, and he compiled it the way it should have been, placing the Makki before the Madani, and the abrogated before the abrogation, and he placed everything in its correct location. (7)<br \/>\nThis is why Ja`far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq (as) said: &#8220;By Allah if the Qur&#8217;an was recited as it was revealed you would have found our names in it just as those before us were named.&#8221; (8)<br \/>\nAnd he (as) said: &#8220;The Qur&#8217;an was revealed four parts, a quarter about us, a quarter about our enemies, a quarter are Sunan and examples, and a quarter is obligatory duties and rulings, and for us Ahlul-Bayt are the best parts.&#8221; (9)<br \/>\nHowever, it was authentically narrated from our Imams (as) that they were ordered to recite what is in between the two covers, and to not exceed it by addition or subtraction, until al-Qa&#8217;im rises, then he will recite for the people the Qur&#8217;an as Allah revealed it and as was gathered by Ameer al-Mu&#8217;mineen (10).]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we were to add our own footnotes to further explain what al-Mufid meant:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(1) He means all that is found in our present Qur&#8217;an are true words of Allah, obviously he doesn&#8217;t mean this is ALL the Qur&#8217;an. It means he doesn&#8217;t believe in additional Tahreef.<br \/>\n(2) Notice he says &#8220;Jumhour&#8221; meaning MOST of the revelation, not all of it.<br \/>\n(3) Meaning the rest of what was revealed is with the guardian, he most probably means the Mahdi.<br \/>\n(4) Meaning the first three Khulafa&#8217; that collected the Qur&#8217;an we have today.<br \/>\n(5) He claims these Caliphs never included the &#8220;rest of what was revealed&#8221; for their own personal\/political reasons.<br \/>\n(6) As you can see, he claims the Caliphs didn&#8217;t know parts of the Qur&#8217;an, so they missed them, they had doubts about other parts, so they skipped them, and finally they intentionally removed some parts.<br \/>\n(7) He&#8217;s telling us that the correct Qur&#8217;an that contains everything was only gathered by `Ali, and obviously we all know the story they narrate about the Caliphs rejecting his Qur&#8217;an.<br \/>\n(8) al-Mufid believes the names of the Imams are mentioned in the correct Qur&#8217;an.<br \/>\n(9) al-Mufid believes that half of the Qur&#8217;an talked about the Imams and their enemies, this part was omitted by the Caliphs.<br \/>\n(10) He believes the Mahdi will reveal the true Qur&#8217;an later.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">We testify in the name of Allah (swt) that we believe in the present Quran being perfect; with neither anything missing from it nor any thing added to it. Right from \u201cBismillah\u201d till \u201cWalnaas\u201d, we Shia also believe in the same Quran which Ahle Sunnah do and accusing us for having faith on the deletion or addition in Quran by the Sahaba worshippers is totally wrong and an out and out lie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are no reasons to doubt the intentions of ShiaPen. They appear to be sincere in their words and have put a major effort into defending the Shia madhhab from such claims. It should be apparent to all that this is not their view. However, there is little doubt that many Shia scholars, early and late, did believe in this. Continue reading for the evidences of such.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen deviate slightly off-topic and argue the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Those accusing Shias of practicing Taqiyyah while they actually testify to the authenticity of Quran are Mushriks for two reasons<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Some Nasibi mullahs just feed their followers to use the card of Taqiyyah against Shias on their testimony about the authenticity of Holy Quran. What they do not tell their adherents is the actual meaning of Taqiyyah. Taqiyyah is to hide one\u2019s belief when there is genuine fear of life like someone is physically and literally forcing you or putting sword on your neck to utter what you do not really believe else he could put your life to an end. The Nawasib who on the internet or in their books reject the testimony of Shias about the authenticity of Holy Quran by accusing them for practicing Taqiyyah and hiding their actual belief are in fact Mushriks (polytheist) because of the following two reasons:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 1. They possess some self-proclaimed supernatural ability to enter computer or book from one side and come in and exit in a manner that enables them to literally force the Shia to bear testimony about the authenticity of Quran (whilst practicing Taqiyyah).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 2. They are indirectly claiming to possess knowledge of unseen like Allah (swt), despite the distance of millions of miles through their x-ray vision that enables them to ascertain actual Shia beliefs by examining their hearts through from which they can confidently conclude that the Shias are practicing Taqiyyah and don\u2019t actually believe in the completeness of the Quran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Had this been the era of the Imams of the Nawasib Muawyah or Yazeed wherein Shias were under oppression and aggression then methodology might have worked, fortunately we are living in an entirely new world today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our response: We agree with ShiaPen that Sunnis should not hold the view that most Shias hold the view that the Qur\u2019an is corrupted, but it seems that the majority of Shias today sincerely do not believe in this. However, ShiasPen has made an absurd claim that Taqiyyah is only limited to periods of fear and danger. This is not the case. This is off-topic, we find it sufficient to point readers to Faisal Noor\u2019s Al-Taqiyyah wal Wajh Al-Aakhir, who has collected many quotes from scholars and evidences from authentic Shia hadiths that suggest that Taqiyyah can be practiced at all times, even when there aren&#8217;t any signs of danger around.<br \/>\nIf the authors of ShiaPen are not aware of this fact, then they should not be publishing articles on Tashayyu in the first place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen continue to quote a Sunni who has invited the Shias to make Takfeer upon those that held the belief that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with. ShiaPen responded:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Invitation to Nawasib that Umar and Ayesha also believed in the distortion of Quran<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Had this alleged Maulana read the major Tafseers of Ahle Sunnah like Tafseer al Itqan, Tafseer Dur Manthoor, Tafseer Tabari without the shackles of Nasbism &amp; Yazeedism he would have known that amongst the claimants of distortion in Quran are Umar, Usman, their sons, Ayesha, other Sahaba, Tabayen and many Sunni ulema. If cursing and declaring those people who believed in the distortion of Quran as kaffirs makes one\u2019s faith more strong and pure then Nawasib should initiate this noble cause, by issuing takfeer, cursing and publicly dissociating themselves from the above mentioned culprits.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We say: Sunnis will gladly make Takfeer on any individual that believes in the Tahreef of the Qur\u2019an if such claims are correct.

Most of the Akhbariyeen held the view that there is Tahreef and addition and deletion, and that is apparent from Al-Kulayni (may Allah have mercy on them) and his shaikh Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Qummi (may Allah have mercy on them) and Al-Shaikh Ahmad bin Abi Talib Al-Tabrasi (may Allah have mercy on them) the author of Al-Ihtijaaj, and as for Al-Sayyed and Al-Saduq and Al-Muhaqiq Al-Tabrasi and most of the Mujtahideen (may Allah have mercy on them) didn\u2019t believe it to be so.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notice how he wishes mercy upon those who he believes held the opinion that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with. That&#8217;s a huge issue, as they don&#8217;t see it as much of a problem if one were to hold the belief that the Qur&#8217;an is corrupt, for them it is simply a legitimate point of view that has no effect on a man&#8217;s faith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen then point out that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">We have obviously left out the Akhbari scholars from the list and haven\u2019t commented on their remarks and they include Al-Jazairi, Abu al-Hassan al-Amili, Syed Adnan al-Bahraini, Yusuf al-Bahraini etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They apparently did this because the quotes from these men about Tahreef were too clear to twist.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As much as we at TwelverShia enjoy quoting texts from Shia scholars that indicate their view of Tahreef, we would like to point out that Shia scholars themselves have already done the job for us. We suggest for interested readers a valuable book, regardless of its small size, called: Who Accuses the Twelver Shia Scholars of Tahreef? In this book, the author, Abdulrahman bin Aadam, quotes late scholars who have attributed this view to the early scholars. The book includes a decent amount of scans as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, the author quotes Al-Majlisi\u2019s view in Mir\u2019aat Al-Uqool 3\/30 that Al-Kulaini and Al-Mufeed believe that what we have in the Mushaf are only portions of the Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another example includes a scan from Al-Durar Al-Najafiya 4\/65-66 in which he attributes these beliefs to Al-Kulaini, Ali bin Ibrahim, Al-Mufeed, Al-Tabrasi the author of Al-Ihtijaaj, and Abdullah bin Salih Al-Bahrani.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most importantly perhaps are the views of Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi, who included a huge list of scholars that believed in Tahreef until the third introduction in his book (p. 26-32). The list includes: Mohammad bin Al-Hasan Al-Sairafi, Mohammad bin Khalid Al-Barqi, Al-Fadhl bin Shathaan, Ahmad bin Mohammad bin Khalid Al-Barqi, Ali bin Al-Hasan bin Fidhal, Mohammad bin Hasan Al-Saffar, Sa\u2019ad bin Abdullah Al-Qummi, Isma\u2019eel bin Nawbakht, Al-Hasan bin Musa Al-Nawbakhti, Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Qummi, Al-Ayyashi, Al-Kulaini, Abu Qasim Al-Nawbakhti, Ibn Al-Hajjam, Al-Nu\u2019mani, Furat Al-Kufi, Ali bin Ahmad Al-Kufi, Al-Sayyari, Al-Mufeed, Ishaaq Al-Kaatib, Ibn Shahrashoub, Hasan bin Sulaiman Al-Hilli, Hajib bin Al-Laith, Ahmad bin Abi Talib Al-Tabrasi, Ali bin Tawuus, Mohammad bin Hasan Al-Shaybani, Mohammad Taqiuddin Al-Majlisi, Al-Mazindrani, Ali Khan, Mohammad Baqir Al-Majlisi, Al-Nabati Al-Amili, Mohammad bin Ali Al-Maqabi, Al-Bahbahani, Mohammad Mahdi bin Abi Dhar Al-Najafi, Muhsin Al-Kathimi, Jawad Ali Redha Al-Najafi, Ahmad bin Mohammad Mahdi Al-Naraqi, and Murtadha Mohammad Ameen Murtadha Al-Ansari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book includes a list of forty six Shia scholars who have been accused of holding the opinion of Tahreef, and that they have been accused of this by Shia scholars themselves. So it is a must read for anyone interesting in the matter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Towards the end of the chapter, we find the following argument by ShiaPen:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">What about those who believed in Tahreef?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Amongst the different objections that come from Nawasib and some contemporary Sunnies are two connected questions:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 1. Why have the Shia Ulema never issued takfeer against that small number of scholars that ascribed to Tahreef<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 2. Why have later Ulema not only praised them but quoted their works.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> For such an objection we would like to ask a question:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> \u201cWhy do you not examine the contents in your own garden in the first instance? Who on earth has given you the right to point out fingers at others for a matter that grows abundantly in your own garden?\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> It is well known that Sahabah and Tabeeen used to deny and change some verses of the Quran (Majum\u2019 Fatawa Vol 12 page 492-493), Ayesha used to recite some words in verse 2:238 which we can\u2019t locate today and not only that, she insisted that the Prophet (s) used to recite it with those particular words (Sahih Muslim Book 004, Number 1316), Abi bin Kaab got furious at Umar who would recite verse 100 of Surah Taubah differently (Tafseer Dur e Manthur, Vol 3 page 269) etc. We have dedicated three chapters in this article for such Sunni references where you will find plenty of Sahabah that believed in the version of verses of Quran that differ from the present form.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> In accordance with the question thrown as us, have such inquisitors abandoned their relationship with all those Sahabah and issued takfeer against them? If they haven\u2019t done it so to date, they should steer clear from posing such questions until they implement it in their own house.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again, we have no issue about making Takfeer upon anyone who holds such a belief, no matter who holds it. We only wish that ShiaPen would do the same. Soon, we shall examine the argument brought against the scholars of Ahlulsunnah to see how these accusations fall flat.<br \/>\nIn the next section of the article, ShiaPen list out the narrations that suggest Tahreef:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Chapter Five: Analyzing some of the Shia reports about Tahreef<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> In this chapter we shall examine those Shia traditions that infer tahreef. After citing such hadiths we will present the views of Shia scholars about them and shall evidence that they are insufficient to prove distortion of Quran. Having cited the interpretations, reasonings and rejections presented by Shia Ulema about some of the hadiths on the topic it will be very easy for a person to decide about other such traditions. There are different groups of hadiths which suggest a distortion in the Quran.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen did a decent task of breaking down the weak traditions that suggest this. However, they have missed out on a good number of authentic traditions that are clear about Tahreef.<br \/>\nWe at TwelverShia have collected some of the most authentic narrations that suggest Tahreef and we would like to share them with ShiaPen, you can read some samples in the second part of our old article here:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\" http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2013\/06\/12\/475\/\"><strong>Response to: Proof of Leadership With Divine Authority in the Words of Allah (swt) and His Messenger (saw)<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the rest, we will InshaAllah gather many in an upcoming article if Allah wills.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to these reports, there are hundreds of narrations that can only be found in the books of `Ali al-Qummi and the book of Al-Sayyari. However, as Al-Khoei has stated from what ShiaPen has quoted, there is a consensus among Rijal scholars that he is a weak narrator.<br \/>\nIronically, in this day and age, there are those that defend Al-Sayyari like Ayatollah Mohammad Al-Sanad who followed Al-Nuri Al-Tabrisi in his opinion. They both argued that Al-Sayyari was relied upon in his narrations by Al-Kulaini, Al-Barqi, Ibrahim bin Mohamad bin Abdullah, Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Ibrahim, Sa\u2019ad bin Abdullah Al-Ash\u2019ari, and many others, and therefore, should not be seen as a weak narrator. Al-Sanad also argued that Al-Sayyari was weakened because people didn\u2019t like his narrations and could not grasp them. See p. 342-349 from Al-Ijtihad wal Taqleed fi Ilm Al-Rijal by Al-Sanad for details on why he believes that this man is reliable.<br \/>\nIn the next chapter, ShiaPen respond to points that are raised by their opponents. Hopefully they will attempt to respond to our points as well.<br \/>\nIn part two of our response, we will go through the arguments that ShiaPen uses to attempt to prove that Sunnis believe in Tahreef.
