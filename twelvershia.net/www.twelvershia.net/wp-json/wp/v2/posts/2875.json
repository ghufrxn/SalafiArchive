From the earliest Shia books of Qur&#8217;anic sciences we have Tafseer al-Qummi, a book written by `Ali bin Ibrahim (d.329AH) the book of course was filled with narrations of Tahreef to the extent that today&#8217;s Twelvers are so embarrassed by it that they act as if they reject it. Another early Twelver book is Tafseer Furat al-Koufi written by abu al-Qasim Furat bin Ibrahim\u00a0al-Koufi (d.352AH) also a book filled with Tahreef that they claim to disown when it suites them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another rare early book we came across written by a Twelver about the Qur&#8217;anic sciences was called &#8220;Kitab-ul-Qira&#8217;at&#8221; or &#8220;Al-Tanzil wal-Tahreef&#8221; by abi `Abdillah Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Sayyari (d.267AH). A very early book which makes it very valuable, of course when we opened the book and looked inside, it was no surprise, this extremist Shia scholar filled its pages with narrations of Tahreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Sayyari was one of the top Twelver Shia narrators in the time of al-`Askari, in fact `Ali bin Ibrahim al-Qummi himself narrates from him in his book 2\/409:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u064a : \u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u00a0\u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u00a0\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0642\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0625\u0631\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0624\u0647 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u0627\u0624\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also known that a group of Shia scholars have authenticated anybody whose name was mentioned in the chains of al-Qummi&#8217;s Tafseer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Sayyari however is considered a weak narrator and an extremist by al-Tusi, al-Najashi and Ibn al-Ghada&#8217;iri. Other Shia scholars of Hadith did not agree, they believed the man was unjustly branded as weak due to the nature of his reports.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia Muhaddith and the author of one of the eight main Shia Hadith books, al-Noori al-Tabrasi says about the man and his book: &#8220;In general, we can say that after the grand scholars narrated from him, such as: Al-Himyari, al-Saffar, abi `Ali al-Ash`ari, Musa bin al-Hasan al-Ash`ari and al-Hussayn bin Muhammad bin `Amir who are from the top reliable scholars, as well as the reliance of Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni on him (in al-Kafi). I add, also based on the fact that his book is devoid of any extremism or confusion and the reliance of the top scholars on him, then we should ignore what was said\u00a0about him and\u00a0shouldn&#8217;t doubt his book.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: Conclusion of Al-Mustadrak 1\/114, second benefit #23.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Kulayni even considered him from his companions, he referred to him in al-Kafi vol.1 &#8220;Bab-ul-Fay'&#8221; #5:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u060c \u0639\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0623\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0638\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u064a<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[`Ali bin Muhammad bin `Abdullah, from some of our companions, as I recall al-Sayyari&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which is also no surprise, since al-Kulayni did believe in Tahreef like al-Qummi and al-Sayyari, he has an entire chapter in his book about this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The author of Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah, one of the eight main Shia books of Hadith, the popular leader of the Shia, al-Hurr al-`Amili himself considered al-Sayyari&#8217;s books from the accepted reliable sources.
