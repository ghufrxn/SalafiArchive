In this article, we will be focusing on the intentions of the Companions and their hesitation. Shias often claim that the Companions intended to prevent the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 from appointing Ali, and thus, caused the nation to fall into misguidance. The narration is also used to suggest that the Companions disbelieved by accusing the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 of losing his mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These arguments are made with little understanding of the context as we shall soon see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Note:<\/strong> We would like readers to keep in mind that we have established in the previous article that the content of the will was unknown to the Companions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The text of the narration:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ibn Abbas narrated:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was `Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; said, &#8220;Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; `Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarreled. Some said &#8220;Go near so that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while the others said as `Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211;\u00a0 said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4432)<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In this topic, we will be taking a deep look at the following aspects and sections of the \u201cCalamity of Thursday\u201d:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u201cHe is Delirious!\u201d <\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u201cThe Book of Allah is Sufficient\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Omar\u2019s Mistake<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to Sunnis?<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to the Shias?<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u201cHe is Delirious!\u201d <\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Perhaps the most common claim that Shias raise is that Omar accused the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 of being delirious. First of all, we do not find this statement being attributed to Omar in any of the narrations. The narration does not determine who made this statement, but only states that some of the Companions did. Moreover, the terms used differ in the narrations. In some narrations, we find them saying, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211;\u00a0 is delirious.\u201d (Al-Bukhari #3053), though in most of the narrations, we find it posed as a question, in which they ask, \u201cIs he delirious?\u201d (Al-Bukhari #3168, #4431, and Muslims #1637).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even though in the coming centuries it has become accepted among the scholars that it is impossible for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 to become delirious, it was not a view that had achieved consensus during the time of the Companions, for they were not exposed to these philosophical discussions. Rather, they understood the religion as it was presented to them and did not partake in such discussions seeing as to how it was unnecessary when they had a prophet from Allah among them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In other words, those that have uttered those words had no issue with reconciling the idea that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 can be delirious, without it contradicting his status as a prophet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some Shias like to claim that holding such a view is disbelief. We would like them to provide their proof that one who testifies that \u201cthere is no god but Allah and Mohammad is His Messenger\u201d is a disbeliever if they believe in the <strong>possibility<\/strong> of a prophet becoming delirious when suffering from an extreme ailment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is also important to keep in mind that the specifics of the \u201cCalamity of Thursday\u201d incident have not been narrated in a detailed manner. At face value, one would make the assumption that the statement, \u201cIs he delirious?\u201d was uttered at the mere suggestion of the writing of a will. An assumption like this is due to a shallow reading. The hesitation of the Companions was due to their uncertainty of what the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was intending to say due to his fatigue. Readers with relatives that have suffered from terminal illnesses will be able to relate to this. If we keep in mind that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was suffering twice as much as the common man (Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5648 and Saheeh Muslim #2571), it is understandable how his fatigue would affect his speech and how that would cause confusion to the Companions. This is the observation of Omar as well who clearly stated that \u201cthe Prophet\u2019s \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 pain has overtaken him.\u201d Ibn Abbas himself says in the beginning of the narration that this event took place when the Prophet\u2019s \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 pain and suffering had increased. (Al-Bukhari #114)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u201cThe Book of Allah is Sufficient\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Perhaps one of the more confusing statements that were uttered in the gathering was the statement of Omar, \u201cThe Book of Allah is sufficient for us.\u201d So, why did Omar say this? The most obvious answer is that it is because this is what the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 said several weeks ago during the pilgrimage. Jabir narrated (Saheeh Muslim #1218), \u201cYou shall not go astray if you hold onto what I have left among you: The Book of Allah.\u201d As we can see, the wordings are extremely similar, and thus, Omar knew that his answer was correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, we do not believe that this was what the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 intended to dictate, for he had already stated this in front of a hundred thousand pilgrims a few weeks before. There was no need to have it written down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So even though we do believe that Omar\u2019s answer was the correct one, we do believe that his <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">other assumption<\/span> was incorrect, which was that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 would get better, which leads us to our next point.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Omar\u2019s Mistake<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A point that many people overlook is that Omar had no idea that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was going to pass away. The most obvious evidence for this is his extreme denial upon hearing the news. He shouted, \u201cBy Allah, the Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 did not die!\u201d (Al-Bukhari #3667)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Not only did Omar have no idea, but Ali was oblivious as well (Al-Bukhari #4447):<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">`Ali bin Abi Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 \u00a0during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. `Ali)! How is the health of Allah&#8217;s Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 \u00a0this morning?&#8221; `Ali replied, <strong>&#8220;He has recovered with the Grace of Allah.&#8221;<\/strong> `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him, &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With the above in mind, we come to the conclusion that those that opposed the writing of the will did not do so because they had an issue with the content, but rather, had an issue with the circumstances. In other words, they would have been all for the writing of the will as soon as the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 got better. Little did they know that his health would not improve and that he would pass away a few days later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Omar\u2019s mistake was not that he believed that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an is sufficient,\u201d since those are the words of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; . Omar\u2019s mistake is that he believed that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 would dictate the teachings after he got better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to Sunnis?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">No. According to the Sunni view, the Muslims did not go astray. The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was referring to the Muslims in a general sense, and the majority of the Muslims, from his time to modern times, are upon the correct path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Muslims held onto the Book of Allah, which kept them on the right path. As we have mentioned above, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 himself said that holding onto it will cause one to not go astray.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As for the will, even though it wasn\u2019t written, the majority of the Muslims followed it as we have pointed out in our previous article on the subject of the \u201cCalamity of Thursday.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Did the Muslims go astray According to the Shias?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Yes. According to the Shia view, the majority of Muslims went astray because the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was not \u201callowed\u201d to write his will. The actions of a small group of people that could barely fit into his humble abode, caused the whole Islamic system to collapse, since Ali\u2019s name couldn\u2019t be written down on paper, even though a public declaration of his appointment allegedly took place a few weeks ago in front of ten thousand. That is the Shia view.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Like in our previous article, the misconceptions that surround the topic are due to the preconceptions of Shias, may Allah guide them. The preconceptions in the \u201cCalamity of Thursday\u201d event are that the Companions knew the content of the will, as we have debunked in the previous article, and that they purposefully attempted to neutralize the attempt to write it down. By the grace of Allah, we have proven that both preconceptions are baseless in the light of the historical context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We would like to remind readers again that the event cannot be found in authentic Shia literature, yet, their bias allows them to accept this as an absolute historical fact because it appeals to their views.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Calamity of Thursday (Intentions of the Companions) The following article is a continuation of our previous article on the Calamity of Thursday (Raziyyat Al-Khamees) in which we focused on the content of the will of the Prophet \u2013 peace be <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2017\/01\/21\/calamity-thursday-intentions-companions\/\" title=\"Calamity of Thursday (Intentions of the Companions)\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3849,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[14],"tags":[32],"class_list":{"0":"post-3643","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-popular-topics","8":"tag-omar"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3643","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3643"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3643\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3687,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3643\/revisions\/3687"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3849"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3643"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3643"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3643"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
