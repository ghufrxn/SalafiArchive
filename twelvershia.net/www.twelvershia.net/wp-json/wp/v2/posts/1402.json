He said: The Messenger then prostrated and those behind him prostrated, except for one man that took a fistful of sand and prostrated upon it. I saw him being killed as a kaffir later, and he was Umayyah bin Khalaf.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe narration does not contain anything to do with the so-called Satanic Verses. However, ShiaSunni.info suggest that:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">The story mentioned in Bukhari is not detailed enough as mentioned in Tabri and other books. But it testifies the particular incident when the Pagans of Mecca performed prostration along with the Muslims except one person (Ummayya) who put rocks on his forehead and pretended the sajdah. If we believe on the story of Bukhari that the pagans performed Sajdah along with the Muslims. It clearly means that something big happened. We all know that the pagans of Mecca were very strong from the Muslims They always use to give hard time to Muslims. If the pagans performed sajdah along with the Muslims, it is very unusual. The story of Bukhari and Tabri testify each other.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">We want to say here that the story mentioned in Bukhari and Tabri is not true, satan cannot put his words in the Holy Prophet\u2019s mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaSunni.info\u2019s conclusion is not academic. A detailed narration is not necessarily complementary to short narrations. Al-Bukhari, who was one of the greatest hadith scholars of all time, was most definitely aware of the hadith of the Satanic Verses, and yet, did not include it in his book due to his condition that the narration must be authentic. Instead, he included a short narration that was authentic. In other words, the explanation and the details found in Al-Tabari\u2019s book are not reliable according to the standards of the hadith scholars, and are therefore rejected. It is silly to think that Al-Bukhari endorses a detailed narration, especially when he knowingly chooses to not include it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nFurthermore, according to ShiaSunni.info, Al-Tabari\u2019s narration contains Walid bin Mughera as the man that did not prostrate. Al-Bukhari\u2019s narration contains Umayyah bin Khalaf. Is this not enough for one to accept that Al-Bukhari\u2019s narration is different from Al-Tabaris and that they do not complement one another?!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nOnce again, a detailed narration doesn\u2019t complement shorter narrations, unless the chain of the detailed narration is authentic. Observe the following example:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) hated a tall man. \u2013 Authentic narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) hated Omar, who was a tall man. \u2013 Fabricated Shia narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nNo sensible hadithist would accept the second narration, simply due to it being more detailed, as an explanation for the first narration, if the chain is weak. That is the objective methodology of the hadith scholars.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to ShiaSunni.info\u2019s article \u201cSatan put his Words in the Prophet\u2019s Mouth.\u201d The article was published in the 24th of December, 2013, and can be found here.
