The Shia however, view this book as purely authentic and see it as the greatest book after Allah&#8217;s book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The issue the Shia had to face was the strong criticism of Ahlul-Sunnah, they said to them: These sermons and sayings which you attribute to `Ali, where did you get them from? Nahj-ul-Balaghah is a very late book with no chains of transmission \u00a0(Isnad), how did al-Radi even get these? We cannot find the vast majority of these in the main Sunni and Shia books!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In response, Shia scholars tried desperately to find other sources that mentioned these sermons in order to defend their holy\u00a0book. They failed miserably for the most part and this topic will show you that not only did they fail but it resulted in some big scandals such as the one regarding Sermon 227.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we open the popular copy of Nahj-ul-Balaghah to sermon 227, we read the following title:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;About a companion who passed away from this world before the occurrence of troubles.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ali\u00a0says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f\u064f \u0641\u064f\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0646\u060c \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0652\u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u060c \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064e\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0629\u064e\u060c \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0641\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u0650\u062a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e! \u0630\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0628\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0651\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0628\u0650\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u0650\u060c \u0623\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0631\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u060c \u0623\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u0649 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0647\u064f\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0642\u0651\u0650\u0647\u0650\u060c \u0631\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0637\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0642 \u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0639\u0651\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0627\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0651\u064f\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0642\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[May Allah reward such and such man, he straightened the curve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief, and established the Sunnah.

Surely it cannot be just any random unknown &#8220;companion&#8221; who died now could it? Rarely have we ever seen `Ali attribute such major praise to anyone so he definitely cannot be an unknown personality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we refer to the oldest and most popular commentary on Nahj-ul-Balaghah, written by the Mu`tazili Shia Ibn abi al-Hadid [died. 656 AH].<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn abi al-Hadid says in Sharh Nahj-ul-Balaghah 12\/3: &#8220;The one meant here is `Umar bin al-Khattab, I have found the original copy of Nahjul Balagha in abi al-Hasan al-Radi\u2019s own handwriting and he wrote \u201c`Umar\u201d under the word \u201csuch and such\u201d.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also writes: &#8220;I asked the head of the order of Ahlul-Bayt, abu Ja`far Yahya bin abi Zayd al-`Alawi\u00a0(about this matter) and he said: \u201c`Umar bin al-Khattab\u201d, I told him: \u201cWould the chief of believers praise him this much!?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes.\u201d&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, he\u00a0said in 2\/4: &#8220;If the chief of believers admitted that he departed with untarnished clothes and that he obeyed Allah and feared him, then this is the utmost praise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This is shocking, Ibn abi al-Hadid is known for his Shia leanings, yet he&#8217;s saying al-Radi wrote &#8220;`Umar&#8221; with his own handwriting under the words &#8220;such and such&#8221;. Ibn abi al-Hadid himself was surprised that he had to\u00a0ask the &#8220;Naqib&#8221; or the head of the order of prophetic-household in his time who confirmed that `Ali was praising Ibn al-Khattab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we further investigate this, we wonder why would al-Radi write\u00a0his name in that fashion? It seems as though there was a conflict, it is possible that al-Radi was initially\u00a0pressured\u00a0to remove the name by the extremist Shia who could never accept this fact. It could also be that his corrupt brother al-Murtada, a deviant Rafidi, he could have been behind the removal of the name. Al-Radi being the more noble of the two, his consciousness did not allow him to participate in that charade.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why did we accuse al-Murtada of this instead of al-Radi? Other than the fact that whoever read al-Murtada&#8217;s book knows for a fact how much of a deceitful Rafidi he is and how sly and stubborn he is when it comes to supporting his false beliefs, we will list this short story from the book &#8220;Sharh Nahj-ul-Balaghah&#8221; by Ibn abi al-Hadid 1\/24:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I read in the handwriting of Muhammad bin Idris al-Hilli, the Imami jurist, he said: It was narrated by abu Hamid Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Isfarayini, the Shafi`i jurist, he said: One day I was with Fakhr-ul-Malik abi Ghalib Muhammad bin Khalaf, the minister of Baha&#8217;-ul-Dawlah and his son Sultan-ul-Dawlah when abu al-Hasan al-Radi entered upon him. So he (i.e. the minister) venerated him, he praised him and left whatever was in his hands in order to speak with him until he (i.e. al-Radi) had to leave. After that, abu al-Qasim al-Murtada entered upon him but the minister did not show much respect\u00a0nor did he honor him, instead he busied himself with whatever was in his hands from paper-work. Al-Murtada sat for a short while, he asked for some favors which the minister fulfilled then left, so I (i.e. abu Hamid) said: &#8220;May Allah forgive you O minister! This was al-Murtada, he is the outspoken jurist who is learned in several fields, he is the best of the two! Abu al-Hasan al-Radi is only a poet.&#8221; He replied to me: &#8220;When this Majlis ends and the people leave I shall answer you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Abu Hamid mentions that he remained until people left\u00a0and only the guards and servants remained, then they left after he had his feast)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The minister told the servant: &#8220;Bring me the two letters I handed you earlier&#8221; He brought them and told me: &#8220;This is a letter from al-Radi, he wrote it to me, telling me that his son was born. I sent him a thousand Dinars and said: This is to pay for the midwife, as the habit is between friends in these times. However, al-Radi returned my gift and wrote me this letter.&#8221; I opened the letter and read his (short) apology for not\u00a0accepting the gift: &#8220;We the household do not permit\u00a0a strange midwife\u00a0to intrude in our affairs, our old women take care of it without charging a fee or taking a gift.&#8221; The minister said: &#8220;That&#8217;s that. As for al-Murtada, we had charged some tax over the properties in Badouriya so that we may spend it on digging an opening for the river known as Nahr-`Isa, this tax has included one of al-Sharif al-Murtada&#8217;s properties in al-Dahiriyyah with the amount of twenty Dirhams for the price of one Dinar. Al-Murtada wrote to me several days ago about this, please read his letter.&#8221; So I read his letter and it was one hundred lines long! Within it he speaks of his loyalty and servitude to the minister and tries to acquire his sympathy and win his heart so that his property may be exempt from those few Dirhams that were imposed on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fakhr-ul-Malik said: &#8220;Now, which of the two brothers do you see more worthy of honor and praise? This outspoken jurist and unique scholar with such (a horrible) character, or that other one who is only popular for his poetry but possesses such (a noble) character!?&#8221; I said: &#8220;May Allah grant our master the minister more success!&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The story basically shows how miserly and greedy al-Murtada is and how he tried with a long pathetic letter to weasel his way out of paying his dues like everyone else, this dishonesty and corrupt attitude is reflected in most of his writings believe it or not so one cannot but suspect that he was behind the removal of `Umar&#8217;s name as opposed to his brother who couldn&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Returning to our previous topic, al-Radi [died. 406 AH] can&#8217;t have traveled back in time to hear this, he must have quoted this sermon from past books,\u00a0so we dug for the sources of this sermon in past books.
