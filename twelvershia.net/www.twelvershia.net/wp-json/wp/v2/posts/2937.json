Minhaj Al-Sunnah 8\/420<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned him as the fourth rightly guided caliph, and they are the best of the nation. Majmu Al-Fatawa 11\/129<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- \u201cThe waging war against them (the Khawarij) was one of his greatest deeds and it was from his wars that are to be praised, for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 promoted warring with them.\u201d Al-Istiqama 1\/259<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10- \u201cAs for Uthman, Ali, and Al-Husain \u2013 may Allah be pleased with them &#8211; , they were killed as oppressed martyrs according to the consensus of Ahlulsunnah.\u201d Al-Masa\u2019il wa Ajwiba p. 71.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11- Ibn Taymiyyah quoted a narration about the battle of Khaibar, that the Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 said that: I will give the flag to a man tomorrow that will be victorious in his conquest, one who loves Allah and His messenger, and is loved by Allah and His messenger.\u201d Ibn Taymiyyah refers to this as one of the most authentic merits of Ali. He then comments: <strong>This is a testimony by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 of Ali\u2019s faith inwardly and outwardly, and proof that he is an ally of Allah and His messenger, and that it is an obligation for believers to be his ally, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and it is a response to Nasibis that think that he is a <em>kaffir<\/em> <\/span>(disbeliever) and a <em>fasiq<\/em> (a wretched person) like the Khawarij.<\/strong> Minhaj Al-Sunah 5\/44-46<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">12- Ibn Taymiyyah states that hadith Al-Manzilah is a merit for Ali. Minhaj Al-Sunnah 4\/371<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">13- Ibn Taymiyyah lists narrations as merits for Ali and states that \u201cthere are ten narrations in the Saheeh (excluding other books) about Ali.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Quotes in Praise of Fatima<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- \u201cThe best of Ahlulbayt are Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain, those that he wrapped around them the cloak and supplicated for them exclusively.\u201d Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Fiqhiya p. 55<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- \u201c(She is) the most valuable person to him from his family.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 4\/587<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- \u201c(She is) the most honorable woman.\u201d Iqtidha\u2019 Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqeem 1\/295<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- \u201c(She is) the chief of the women of the worlds.\u201d Jami\u2019 Al-Masa\u2019il 3\/106<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- \u201c(She is) the chief of the women of paraside.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 8\/245<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- \u201cThe best women in this nation are: Khadijah, A\u2019isha, and Fatima.\u201d Majmu\u2019 Al-Fatawa 4\/394<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Quotes in Praise of Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- \u201cThere is no doubt that Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain are the flowers of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 in this world, and that he \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 brought them with him into the cloak, and said: \u2018O\u2019 Allah, they are my Ahlulbayt, send <em>rijs<\/em> away from them and cleanse them,\u2019 and that he \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 brought them with him to <em>mubahala<\/em>, and their merits are many, and they are from the leaders of the believers.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 4\/41.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- \u201cThey are from the companions that were promised heaven.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 4\/168<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- \u201cSince Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain were the chiefs of the youth of heaven, yet, were born after the Hijra during times of strength in Islam, and did not face the hardships faced by their predecessors, Allah bestowed upon them hardships to raise their levels.\u201d Majmu Al-Fatawa 27\/473<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- \u201cAl-Hussain was killed as an oppressed martyr and those that killed him were oppressors.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 5\/585<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- \u201cAs for his (Al-Hasan\u2019s) death, then it is said that he was poisoned, and this is a form of martyrdom and a merit to his name, even if he wasn\u2019t killed during a battle.\u201d Minhaj Al-Sunnah 4\/42<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- \u201cAllah brought peace between through Al-Hasan between the people of Iraq and Shaam, and the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 mentioned this as a merit for Al-Hasan.\u201d Majmu Al-Fatawa 28\/549<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- After narrating a narration in praise of Al-Hasan and Usama bin Zaid, Ibn Taymiyyah commented, \u201cIn this narration, he (the Prophet) combined Al-Hasan and Usama \u2013 may Allah be pleased with them \u2013 by mentioning that he loved them, and by asking Allah to love them, and his love for them is known through multiple authentic hadiths.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Refutations of Quotes by Ibn Taymiyyah that Suggest that he Hated Ali<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before listing the arguments and refutations we would like readers to be aware that some of Ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s statements come in the form of debate responses. So in response to a criticism to Abu Bakr, he would argue something along the lines of \u201cif this is true about Abu Bakr, then Ali is just as guilty or even more so.\u201d When taken out of context, these allegations are read as, \u201cAli is guilty of <em>x<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Argument: While comparing Abu Bakar with Ali bin Abi Talib (as), Ibn Taimiyah states in Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 7 page 331: \u201cHis reign is better than Ali\u2019s reign and his benefit to Muslims in their religion and life is greater than Ali\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: Preference of Abu Bakr or his reign as a caliph over Ali and his reign does not make Ibn Taymiyyah a Nasibi, but rather, this is the belief of every Sunni.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 8 page 230: \u201cAli fought to secure obedience and rule the people and money, so how can that be deemed as fighting for sake of religion?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: The text is taken out of context. The context in full is a refutation to those that say that Abu Bakr fought the apostates for wealth. Ibn Taymiyyah responds that Abu Bakr never took any wealth nor put any of his relatives in power, so it is easier to attribute Ali to such a sin than to attribute Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Argument: We read in Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 8 page 205: There are two opinions as to whether Ali\u2019s conversion to Islam released him from kufr or not\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: The quote is taken out of context, for Ibn Taymiyyah is refuting the allegation that the caliphs were oppressors since they used to be disbelievers before Islam. In response, Ibn Taymiyyah argues that their conversion to Islam is a greater merit to them than Ali\u2019s conversion since they were adults and conversion is a bigger responsibility and harder for adults. He asks: Do Islamic regulations apply to converts that haven\u2019t hit puberty? He then argues that there is a difference of opinion since Shafi\u2019ees do not believe that Islamic regulations apply until then. He is in no way suggesting that Ali is a non-Muslim. Rather, Ibn Taymiyyah sees Ali\u2019s conversion to Islam as a child as a merit, as seen in the merits section above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 4 page 137: \u201cAli intended to marry so as to hurt her (Fatima) on purpose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: The quote is taken out of context. Ibn Taymiyyah is refuting the idea that Abu Bakr hurt Fatima. He states that Abu Bakr did not do it intentionally, but it was due to his his <em>ijtihad<\/em> and that he has no personal benefit from hurting her. Ibn Taymiyyah then refers to the incident that is accepted by all Sunnis that Ali wanted to get a second wife, and that this action would hurt Fatima. In other words, he has a purpose, which is to get a second wife, and that purpose would hurt Fatima.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 7 page 172: \u201cAllah had revealed for Ali {O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter,} when he prayed and recited and then got mixed up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: There is a consensus that this verse was revealed before the prohibition of alcohol. To condemn Ali of drinking alcohol during the time of prohibition is like condemning him for not praying five times a day before the revelation of the mandatory prayers. In other words, Ibn Taymiyyah was not condemning Ali, but rather, refuting Shias that were quoting verses that supposedly condemn Abu Bakr by suggesting that he could also exaggerate verses out of proportion as they did if he had issues with Ali.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 3 page 53: \u201cWhen he (the Prophet) ordered them to offer the night prayer, Ali (ra) came up with the prepared excuse that \u2018if Allah wants he will wake us up\u2019, the prophet realized that this was merely an argument that was not right, therefore he recited <em>{but man is more than anything contentious}<\/em>\u201c.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: The narration is from the Saheehain and speaks of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 attempting to wake Ali and Fatima up for a night prayer. Like the above, it is not a real condemnation for Ali or Fatima since the night prayer is not obligatory and to not practice it is not a sin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 8 page 161: \u201cAli, there is disagreement about him as to whether he had memorized the whole Quran or not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: To blatantly state that Ali did not memorize the Qur\u2019an completely is not a sign of a Nasibi, for memorizing the Qur\u2019an completely is not mandatory upon Muslims. Ibn Taymiyyah does not even go that far, but merely mentions a difference of opinion as to whether Ali memorized it or not. Ibn Taymiyyah only mentions this when comparing Uthman and Ali. He states that Uthman was more knowledgeable when it came to the Qur\u2019an and that Ali was more knowledgeable when it came to the Sunnah. Once again, these are not signs of a Nasibi. Rather, a Nasibi would refer to Ali is someone who is ignorant in the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 4 page 20: \u201cHis (Allamah Heli\u2019s) statement that Ali would pray one thousand raka, surely there is no virtue in it\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: Indeed, there is no virtue in praying a thousand prostrations, since the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 did not pray a thousand prostrations. Rather, it would be an innovation, and Islam has prohibited monasticism. Ibn Taymiyyah then states: This (merit) is a lie.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 7 pages 529 \u2013 530: \u201cNone of the four imams nor the other of the jurists refer to him (Ali) in their jurisprudence.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: None of the four Imams referred took their jurisprudence from the three other caliphs either. Rather, all the Imams took their schools from the Qur\u2019an, the hadith, their direct teachers, and would benefit from supporting evidences from the Sahaba, including the four caliphs. This does not make the Imams Nasibis or Rafithis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Refutations of a Quote by Ibn Taymiyyah that Suggests that he Hated Fatima<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 5 page 522: Verily Abu Bakr is an Imam who did not act for himself but for the Muslims and as for the money, he did not take it for himself but for the Muslims whilst Fatima was demanding it for herself. Ibn Taymiyyah then likened the anger of Fatima to the anger of hypocrites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: Fatima believed she inherited Fadak and assumed that she had ownership rights. Her anger is justified due to that assumption, unlike the hypocrites, which is why Ibn Taymiyyah then says, \u201cHow is it possible for him (Abu Bakr) to prevent (the rights) of the chief of the women of the worlds (if she was correct in her claim)?!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Refutation of a Quote by Ibn Taymiyyah that Suggests that he Hated Al-Hasan and Al-Husain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Argument: Minhaj al-Sunnah, Volume 4 page 19: \u201cTo be deemed as the most ascetic and knowledgeable people of their time, this is a proofless claim.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response: Indeed, there is no proof that Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain were the most knowledgeable people of their time or most ascetic. From a Sunni standpoint, both Ibn Abbas and Ibn Omar were known to be more knowledgeable, for they have narrated multitudes of more hadiths than Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain, and were known for their religious rulings. More importantly, to deny that one was the \u201cmost knowledgeable\u201d or \u201cmost ascetic\u201d in an era does not make one a hater, or in this case, a Nasibi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no doubt in mind that the praise that Ibn Taymiyyah has for these four members of Ahlulbayt are far greater than his praise for most of the Sahaba. However, those with diseases in their hearts will take Ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s refutations out of context in order to make it seem as though he was a Nasibi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t hesitate to re-read the above merits of Ahlulbayt from the words of Ibn Taymiyyah for it to sink in once again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article emits light on the view of Ibn Taymiyyah on Ahlulbayt The article will be split into six sections:  His statements in praise of Ali, Fatima, Ha.. <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2016\/01\/03\/ibn-taymiyyah-and-ahlulbayt\/\" title=\"Ibn Taymiyyah and Ahlulbayt\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3894,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11,6],"tags":[],"class_list":{"0":"post-2937","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-articles","8":"category-fadhail"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2937","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2937"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2937\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4924,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2937\/revisions\/4924"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3894"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2937"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2937"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2937"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
