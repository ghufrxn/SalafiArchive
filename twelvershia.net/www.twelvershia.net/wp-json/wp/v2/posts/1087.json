There are reasons to combining prayers outside of those two reasons, and these exceptions were made to make the religion easier for the people. These include reasons like combining prayers when one is sick, or during rain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA share the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">we find yet another hadeeth and it is from moadh bin jabal, it is on page 252; here is the scan<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The scan clearly shows that this was during travels. It is not likely that there is a practicing Sunni alive that is ignorant of this fact. It is as we have stated, there are exceptions to combining prayers. These do not include the apathy that some Shias display towards their prayers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: &#8220;Combining of Two Prayers \u2013 2&#8221;.
