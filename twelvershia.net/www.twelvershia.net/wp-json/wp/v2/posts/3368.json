Then ibn Abbas went out from his cottage and said: \u2018I respond to your call, Oh Allah I respond to your call, they abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali (ra).<\/strong><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>1. Sunan Nasai, Volume 5 page 253 Tradition 3019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 2. \u00a0Sahih Ibn Khuzaima, Volume 4 page 260 Tradition 2830<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> 3. Mustadrak al-Hakim, Volume 1 pages 364-365<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before even refuting this allegation, those that don\u2019t speak the Arabic language need to be aware that the term <em>talbiya<\/em> is the call that we find the pilgrims practicing during Hajj, in which they shout: <em>Labayk Allahuma labaik<\/em>, meaning: O\u2019 my Lord, I\u2019ve answered your call and I\u2019m at your service.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, the Shias use this tradition to suggest that Mu\u2019awiyah not only abandoned the Sunnah, but that he was against <em>dhikr<\/em> as a whole. However, simply by critically examining this narration, we arrive at a completely different conclusion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, there is nothing in the narration that suggests that Mu\u2019awiyah was anti-<em>dhikr<\/em> or anti-Islam from this narration. Rather, the narration revolves around the time in which <em>talbiya<\/em> is to be made. According to Mu\u2019awiyah, <em>talbiya<\/em> is made at Hajj, but not at Arafa in specific.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why we find Ibn Abi Shayba 3\/356 including this hadith in a chapter that he titled: <em>Takbir <\/em>or <em>talbiya<\/em>, what is better during Arafa?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this chapter, he included several narrations that suggest both views. One includes a narration from Ibn Umar saying that he prefers <em>takbir<\/em>. In a narration from Abu Ja\u2019afar, we find him stopping <em>talbiya<\/em> on his way to Arafa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In another chapter 3\/248 he quotes that Al-Qasim bin Mohammad bin Abi Bakr and A\u2019isha did not make <em>talbiya<\/em> when on their way to Arafa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another matter that should catch the reader\u2019s attention is Ibn Abbas\u2019 specific wording: \u201cThey abandon the Sunnah for their hate towards Ali.\u201d Now, why would Ibn Abbas name Ali in particular? This suggests that <em>talbiya<\/em> was not as common at Arafa before Ali.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is supported by a narration from Musanaf Ibn Abi Shayba 3\/356, where in which <em>talbiya<\/em> was heard. Surprised, they asked, \u201cWho is making <em>talbiya<\/em> on this day?!\u201d When they found out that it was Ibn Mas\u2019ud, they went silent. Ibn Mas\u2019ud died during the time of Uthman, which suggests that he made <em>talbiya<\/em> before Ali\u2019s time, and yet, the practice as not too common.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, we can conclude that Mu\u2019awiyah did not intentionally go against the <em>sunnah<\/em>, but rather, acted upon what he believed was the correct Hajj etiquette.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, we find that the Umawi government, under Umar bin Abdulaziz, did the exact opposite of Mu\u2019awiyah, as per Muwatta Malik #660. When he heard people making <em>takbir<\/em>, he sent his guards to call out to the people, \u201cO\u2019 people! Make <em>talbiya<\/em> (instead)!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regardless of which action is more correct, the purpose of this article was to not to analyze the correct position, but rather, to demonstrate that Mu\u2019awiyah made <em>ijtihad<\/em>, as did others before him, and held the belief that the proper Hajj protocol was to make <em>takbir<\/em> instead of <em>talbiya<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are no evidences in the narration that remotely suggest that he purposefully went against the <em>sunnah<\/em>, or took this position to contradict Ali\u2019s actions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Muawiyah and Talbiya at Arafa The following is a response to Shiapen and Slave of Ahlubait&#8217;s accusation (which can be found on his blog and Wilayat.net) against Mu\u2019awiyah of abandoning the Sunnah.
