In short, RTS quotes various types of narrations that he believes supports such innovations. The narrations quoted fall under a few categories.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first group of narrations are ones in which the Messenger (pbuh) appears to Ibn Abbas in a dream. Ibn Abbas narrates. The Messenger (pbuh) is described as having unkempt hair and looking dusty:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated ibn Abbas: &#8216;I saw the Prophet (saw) in a dream, in the middle of the night, he was disheveled and covered with dust. He (saw) had a container in which he was collecting blood.\u00a0I said: &#8216;Oh Allahs (swt) Apostle! What is this?!&#8217; He (saw) replied,\u00a0&#8216;This blood of Hussain and his companions. I have been collecting it since the start of the today.&#8217;\u00a0Ammar said, &#8216;We noted that day, and we soon found out he was martyred on that very day of (Ashura).&#8217;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS comments:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The Shi&#8217;ee Have Preserved The Sunnah Of The Prophet (saw) By Weeping For Imam Hussain (a.s) And Covering Their Heads and Faces With Dust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS goes on to post images of Shias covered in mud to illustrate his point. One doesn\u2019t need to be a linguist in order to differentiate between dust, sand, and mud though, so the comparison is extremely flawed. Furthermore, nothing in the narration implies that the Messenger (pbuh) went out of his way to cover himself in dust; rather, it is simply the condition that he was in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the narration does not include an order for one to spread dust on themselves, or mourn the death of Al-Hussain, but even if it did, it would still not be evidence for such a practice, since it is only a dream.

He said: &#8220;Jibreel (a.s) informed me that Hussain (a.s) will be killed in the soil of Iraq, then I said to Jibreel (a.s) show me the soil of the ground that Hussain (a.s) will be killed in it.&#8217; Then he gave me this soil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Messenger (pbuh) crying over the news that Al-Hussain will be killed is established. However, this specific narration mentions that he was kissing the soil that was brought to him by Jibreel. The first flaw with this narration is that it is from the narration of Abdullah bin Wahb bin Zama\u2019a. Abu Ishaaq Al-Huwaini, the contemporary hadith scholar says, \u201cHe is Majhool Al-Hal (has an unknown status) and wasn\u2019t called trustworthy by anyone other than Ibn Hibban, \u201d (Nathl Al-Nibal, 2\/770) Secondly, when returning to an 8<sup>th<\/sup> century manuscript, the word we find instead of \u201ckissing\u201d is \u201cflipping over\u201d. The letter Laam and the letter Baa have been switched over in the published version which completely changes the meaning of the sentence.

This conclusion is not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, RTS has only proven a single point, which is that the Prophet (pbuh) cried upon hearing the news of the killing of Al-Hussain, which is a natural reaction really and does not justify any modern day Shia practices. There is no evidence that the Prophet (pbuh) beat himself, wiped himself with the mud, ate it, or used the mud to cure himself when he got sick.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Response to: The Significance Of Mourning For Imam Hussain (a.s) The following is a response to the article on Revisitingthesalaf.org entitled: The Significance Of Mourning For Imam Hussain (a.s) that was published on the 21st of November, 2012, and can <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2013\/04\/29\/response-to-the-significance-of-mourning-for-imam-hussain-a-s\/\" title=\"Response to: The Significance Of Mourning For Imam Hussain (a.s)\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":257,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"class_list":{"0":"post-258","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-fadhail"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/258","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=258"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/258\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3014,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/258\/revisions\/3014"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/257"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=258"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=258"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=258"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
