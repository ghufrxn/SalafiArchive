The Holy Prophet (saw) then said to Hudhaifah:\u2018Quickly pull forward, pull forward,\u2019 then the Prophet (saw) came off the camel and asked Ammar (r.a) whether he had identified those people, Ammar (r.a) said:\u2018No, they were masked.\u2019 The prophet (saw) asked: \u2018Do you know what they wanted?\u2019 Ammar (r.a) said: \u2018Allah (swt) and his messenger (saw) know better.\u2019The Prophet (saw) said: \u2018They wanted to throw the Prophet (saw) off from the Uqbah.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">After that when Ammar (r.a) had a dispute with one of them (people who tried to kill the Prophet), Ammar (r.a) said to him: \u2018I swear to you by Allah (swt), how many people of the Uqbah tried to attack the Prophet (saw)?\u2019 The man said: \u2018We think they were about fourteen.\u2019 Ammar (r.a) said: \u2018And if you were amongst them it would be fifteen.\u2019 Three of them put forward this excuse to the Prophet(saw): &#8216;We did not hear the caller of the messenger of Allah (saw)&#8217;. Ammar ibn Yassir (r.a) said: &#8216;I bear testimony that the remaining twelve will fight Allah (swt) and His messenger (saw) in this world and on the day when the witnesses will be resurrected.&#8217;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then, quotes Ibn Hazm who comments on this narration by saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&#8220;Hudhaifah&#8217;s hadeeth is false, because it is narrated<b>through Walid ibn Jumai <\/b>\u2013 he is unreliable \u2013 it seems he does not know who fabricated the hadeeth, because he narrated <b>many reports in which state that Aboo Bakr,<\/b> <b>Umar,<\/b> <b>Uthmaan, Talha and Sa\u2019d ibn Abi Waqas,<\/b> <b>attempted to murder the Holy Prophet (saw) by pushing him over from Al-Uqbah during Tabuk. This is a fabricated lie!&#8221;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then, links the two together by saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Ibn Hazim explicitly reveals they are numerous reports through Walid ibn Jumai in which the identities of Munafiqeen were revealed. The names of those who attempted to kill the Prophet (saw) were Aboo Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan, Talha and Sa&#8217;ad ibn Abi Waqas. But these narrations are no where to be found in any of the book of the so called &#8216;Ahl Sunnah&#8217; today. Where have these narrations gone? Is there a attempt to cover this plot?.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS goes on to defend Al-Waleed bin Jumai\u2019, assuming that doing so would lead to some sort of authentication of the hadith. However, even if one would accept the narrations of Al-Waleed, this narration would still have to be rejected, for the simple reason that Ibn Hazm does not include his chain to Al-Waleed and the chain of Al-Waleed to the eye witness of the event. So, accepting such a narration, in which one knows a single narrator in a chain which could possibly consist of seven to nine narrators, is not reasonable. Keep in mind that Ibn Hazm is a fifth century scholar, which is why his chains are longer than average.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And yet, RTS boasts:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">With such a prominent scholars praising Walid ibn Jumai they can remain not a shadow of doubt about the authenticity of these narrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a side note, it is also more than likely that this narration may have been a late fabrication, one that may have occurred in the fourth century, that has been falsely attributed to Al-Waleed bin Jumai\u2019, since his biographies in various books of Rijal do not contain anything resembling such a narration. It should be noted that the scholars were meticulous about including the strange reports quoted by narrators to show their weakness. So, it is extremely unlikely that the Hadith scholars of the region, some of which even met Al-Waleed, made no mention of this narration, while a fifth century scholar that lived in Andalusia did. This explanation is surely more convincing than the theory that there was an attempt by Sunni scholars to \u201ccover this plot\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS goes on to quote a narration in which Omar asks Huthaifah if he (Omar) is a hypocrite.

Did Umar not know if he was at Uqbah that night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This narration would not make any sense if Omar was asking about those from the `Aqaba, but rather, he was asking about the Munafiqeen in general. There is no evidence that suggests that Huthaifah only knew of the names of the hypocrites of Al-`Aqaba, and the only narration that supports that is the narration quoted by Ibn Lahee\u2019a (who is unreliable according to the majority of Hadith scholars, see Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb p. 2\/411-414, Al-Risala, 1429, first edition), that was quoted by RTS in the beginning of the article.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Didn&#8217;t Umar know If He was a Munafiq or not ? Hudhaifah concealed this fact from him but more importantly why?. The answer is very clear, he was concealing the truth to spare his life.

The actions of Hudhayfah should not come as a surprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the contrary, Huthaifah made it public that Omar was not a hypocrite by narrating this event to Zaid bin Wahb, the narrator from Huthaifah.

It is known that performing good deeds in Islam, with intentions for anyone other than Allah (i.e. for the society, for family), is considered as a form of lesser hypocrisy, which is a trap that even the best of Muslims can fall into.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues to argue:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The actions of Hudhayfah should not come as a surprise.

Then, a messenger brought me back to him, so I entered. He said: Why did you leave? I said: I asked permission \u2013 or \u2013 I greeted thrice and received no permission. He said: If you asked more than that (three times) you wouldn\u2019t have been allowed entry. He said: I thought you were asleep. He said: I don\u2019t sleep until I know where the sun comes from. He (Jundub) said: What is it about that I\u2019ve heard about you about Uthman that I rejected from someone like you would say\u00a0about someone like him?! He (Huthaifah): Some of that is happening, they are going to kill him. He said: Kill him? He said: Kill him \u2013 three times. He said: Where are his killers? He said: In the hellfire, Wallah! \u2013 he said it thrice. He (Jundub) said: What about him? He said: In heaven, Wallah! \u2013 He said it three times. Then he said: The Fitna has begun, so you should escape it. Then he said: I know more about it (the Fitna) than this path and that path. He said: And what do you suggest I do? He said: Stick to what you are upon now, and don\u2019t leave it to another for that will cause you to go astray.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration is authentic, and clearly shows that Huthaifah believed that Uthman is from the people of heaven.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, RTS actually provides a clear narration, where in which Huthaifah accuses a companion of being a Munafiq. This time though, it is Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ari. He quotes:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated Al-A\u2019mash from Shaqiq who said: We were sitting beside Hudhayfah and Abdullah (ibn Mas&#8217;ud) and Aboo Moosa (Al-Ash\u2019ari) entered the mosque, Hudhaifa said: &#8216;One of these two is a Munafiq&#8217;, then he continue to say: &#8216;The most similar people to the Prophet (saw) in his character, his actions and manner is Abdullah. (i.e. Aboo Musa is the Munafiq).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Footnote: the narrators of this narration are trustworthy, and this narration is narrated in Al-Ma\u2019rifa wa Al-Tarikh of Al-Fasawi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This narration, with this text, can only be found in the narration of Abdullah bin Numair from Al-A\u2019amash. In all other chains and paths for this Hadith, we find the same text, but without the addition that Abu Musa was with Ibn Mas\u2019ud. The first of these are the narrations of Abdulrahman bin Yazeed, from Huthaifah. (Sunan Al-Tirmithi, p. 863, Daralsalam, 1420, first edition.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the narrations of Abu Wa\u2019el, also known as Shaqeeq, we find Al-A\u2019amash narrating from him, along with several other narrators, however, the accusation against Abu Musa can only be found in the narration of Abdullah bin Numair. Other narrators that have narrated this from Al-A\u2019amash include include Za\u2019idah (Musnad Ahmad 16\/598, Dar Al-Hadith, 1416, first edition), Muhadhir (Al-Mustadrak, 4\/1204, Al-Maktaba Al-Asriya, 1427), Abu Ishaaq (Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahaba 2\/1062, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1430, fourth edition), Abu Mu\u2019awiyah Mohammad bin Khazim (Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahaba, 2\/1063), and Mohammad bin Ubaid (see Musnad Ahmad 16\/597)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, Za\u2019idah and Abu Mu\u2019awiyah are two of the best known narrators from Al-A\u2019amash, while Abdullah bin Numair is included in a lesser level, so whatever he narrators that conflicts with their narration from him would normally not be accepted. (See Tabaqat Al-Nasa\u2019ee and their biographies in the books of Rijal). Yet, in this narration Abdullah bin Numair is including an addition that isn\u2019t mentioned by six of Al-A\u2019amash\u2019s students, let alone the other chains from Abu Wa\u2019el and Abdulrahman bin Yazeed from Huthaifah. In light of these facts, the addition in the text of the narration is to be rejected based upon the rules of the early hadith scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another piece of evidence that suggests the weakness of the addition in the narration is that the two main narrators of this event, Abu Wa&#8217;el (in\u00a0the six books)\u00a0and Abdulrahman bin Yazeed (in Saheeh Muslim Al-Nasa&#8217;ee, and Ibn Majah),\u00a0are both students of Abu Musa and continued to narrate from him after his death. (Tahtheeb Al-Kamal 3\/402 and 4\/490) It is not logical for them to narrate from Abu Musa if there was evidence that he was a hypocrite.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This is a response to the article published by RevisitingtheSalaf.org, on the 27th of February, 2012, that can be found here.
