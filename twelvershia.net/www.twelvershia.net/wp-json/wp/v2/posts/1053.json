So they&#8217;ll usually try to come up with excuses on the spot.<\/p>\n<p>The reason they do this is of course firstly to try and rationalize their own beliefs, it is a type of Taqiyyah, as why would anyone wish to convert to a religion that makes no sense?<\/p>\n<p>The Mahdi of the Shia was born just before the death of his father according to some Shia sects or some time after the death of his father according to others, the small baby was taken and hidden in the cellar away from the eyes of the people. In both versions of this fairy-tale the previous Imam al-`Askari had absolutely no time at all to teach this baby all of the knowledge of his fathers before him.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of their excuses, those who are knowledgeable about the Madhab know for a fact that the Imams don&#8217;t only narrate from their fathers, and that they make their own Fatwas and religious rulings, and that they address new matters that are unheard of in their fathers days and give an infallible ruling, this is because the Imams do not learn from their fathers as some gullible layShia wish to believe, they can communicate with angels and do receive inspiration and new revelation.<\/p>\n<p>The famous Shia website &#8220;al-Islam&#8221; have uploaded a book called &#8220;Imamate and Leadership&#8221; by Sayyid Mujtaba Musavi Lari the son of Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Asghar Lari. In this book they inform us that all Imams share the exact same knowledge, which is the knowledge of the Prophet (saw):<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>[There are authoritative texts to the effect that whatever was taught to the previous prophets was also known to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and to the Imams, peace be upon them. Thus Imam al-Baqir, peace be upon him, said: &#8220;God has two kinds of knowledge, particular and general. The prophets have no access to the former, nor can the cherubim become aware of it. It is the latter to which the prophets and the cherubim have access, and God&#8217;s Messenger has transmitted it to us.&#8221;]<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Then in the same book they narrate this lovely story:<\/div>\n<blockquote><p>[A Christian scholar by the name of Burayd once went to see Imam al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, in the company of Hisham b. Hakam. In the way they encountered Imam Musa b. Ja&#8217;far, peace be upon him, who asked Burayd how thoroughly he was acquainted with his own scripture. Burayd answered that there was none who could equal him in his knowledge of the Gospels. The Imam then asked him whether he relied on himself for the interpretation of the scriptures, and he replied that he had full confidence in his own understanding and knowledge.Thereupon Imam Musa al-Kazim, peace be upon him, began reciting the Gospels. Burayd was astonished and profoundly affected. He said: &#8220;For fifty years I have been searching for one such as you.&#8221; Then he embraced Islam, as did the woman who was accompanying him.]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div>He also writes:<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>[al-Nawfali says: &#8220;After Imam ar-Ridha\u2019, peace be upon him, arrived, al-Ma&#8217;mun, the Abbasid caliph, gave that invitations to go out to various religious leaders to attend a meeting: the head of the Christian bishops, the leading Jewish rabbi, the leading starworshippers, people that followed no religious law whatsoever, the Zoroastrian judge, a Greek physician, and Muslim theologians all well versed in dogmatics. al-Ma&#8217;mun then sent a message to the Imam inviting him to participate in discussions with these religious leaders (until he said) \u00a0The Imam said: &#8220;Would you like to know when the caliph will repent of his initiative?&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;&#8221;When I argue against the followers of the Torah by citing the Torah, against the followers of the Gospels by citing the Gospels, against the followers of the Psalms by citing the Psalms, against the Sabeans in their own Hebraic tongue, against the Zoroastrian priests in their own Persian tongue, against the Greeks in their own Greek tongue, and against the theologians in their own Arabic tongue; when I defeat all of them with my proofs and arguments so that they abandon their religions and accept the truth of what I say]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p>I ask, if all of the Imams have equal knowledge and each one teaches the next one what he learned from his fathers, than how can a young baby like the Mahdi or any of the previous Imams whose fathers died at a very young age, how can they learn all the knowledge of Islam in addition to all the gospels of the Christians and scriptures of the Jews and all the languages of the world and so on?<\/p>\n<p>Matter of the fact is that this sect has ridiculous beliefs, what we read in their books is inexcusable, no excuse can be made for it.
