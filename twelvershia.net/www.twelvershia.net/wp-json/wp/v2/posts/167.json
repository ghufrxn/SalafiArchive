As if the Old Testament is an acceptable source of information for Muslims, but their hatred for the Prophet&#8217;s (pbuh) wives knows no bounds, RTS argues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Job 9:9 in the Bible is usually translated as referring to three stars or constellations, but in fact there is not the slightest reference to heavenly bodies in the verse. The place in which God created the three figures of Job 9:9 is not the sky, but the southern reaches, that is, the land south of Palestine, or Arabia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> This place gives us a hint about the identity of these three figures that Job prophesies to be of God\u2019s creation. When we examine the history of Arabia for three such figures, indeed three immediately appear. The first figure in Job 9:9 is named Aiysh, using the Hebrew letters \u2018ayin, yod, and shin. These happen to be the three letters that also make up the name in Arabic of Aisha, the daughter of \u00a0Abu Bakar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> The text is careful to identify the first of the three figures by name. It can then use greater liberty in identifying the other two by characteristics rather than name, since it is obvious that the two figures to follow Aisha are the second Khalifah Umar and the third Khalifah Uthmaan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Job 9:9 refers to Umar (la) by the descriptive word k\u2019s\u00eeyl, which literally means \u201cfat\u201d, but is used figuratively for stupid, silly, or foolish. This is in reference to Umar\u2019s well-known ignorance of divine law, which contrasts with the epithet given him by his supporters, Al-Farooq, the one who can distinguish between truth and falsehood \u00a0as mentioned in our previous article as this term init self was given by none muslims. This is precisely what Umar was unable to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> The third figure in Job 9:9 is characterized as k\u00eeyd, literally a crushing, that is, calamity or destruction. What Umar started by favouring the Umayyids and Ottoman brought to a crushing and destructive conclusion through his nepotism. He set all of the leading families of Mecca, the very ones who persecuted the first Muslims, in all of the ruling positions of the empire. Having done that, he compounded his sins by desecrating the Qur\u2019aan, having dozens of copies of it burned in the sight of the faithful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has been brought to the twelvershia.net team, by brother &#8220;Swords of Sunnah&#8221;, from Islamic-forum.net, has already responded to the above by quoting Biblical scholars who have studied the linguistics of the aforementioned verses:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a title=\"External link\" href=\"http:\/\/barnes.biblecommenter.com\/job\/9.htm\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Barnes&#8217; Notes on the Bible<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> The Hebrew word rendered Arcturus, is \u05e2\u05e9\u05c1\u00a0\u00a0\u201bay\u0131\u0302sh.The word \u05e2\u05e9\u05c1\u00a0\u00a0\u201bay\u0131\u0302sh does not literally mean a bear, but is made by\u00a0\u00a0aphaeresis from the Arabic nas, by the excision of the initial n &#8211; as is\u00a0\u00a0common in Arabic; see Bochart, Hieroz.

The following is Job\u2019s praise of the Lord, taken from the Old Testament:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength &#8211;who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:5 he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger,<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:6 who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:7 who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:8 who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:9 who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">9:10 who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, with the verse finally in context, we realize that Job is simply praising the Creator. He praises his omniscience, omnipotence, his power over the mountains, the earth, the sun, the stars, the heavens, the sea, and the constellations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here, the objective reader must ask himself. If Job 9:9 was supposed to be a form of condemnation and warning, and that the names of the constellations should be substituted with the names of Aisha, Omar, and Uthman, would the verses be harmonious in meaning? Or would Job 9:9 be out of place and context? Would Job even refer to them as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cmarvellous things\u201d, as wonders of the powers of the Lord, if he said those things as a warning? The answer is, without a doubt, crystal clear.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May Allah guide the ignorant deviants, their attempts to attack the pillars of the religion are\u00a0truly\u00a0sad&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a rebuttal to the article on RevisitingtheSalaf.org, published on the 28th of February, 2012, which can be found here.
