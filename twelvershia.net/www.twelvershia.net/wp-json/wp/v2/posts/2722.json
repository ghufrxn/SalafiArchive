It is also even more ironic that the narration suggests that the highest merit is to die during Jihad as a Companion of the Prophet peace be upon him.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Introduction The following are the hadith gradings to Abdul-Rahim Mugahi\u2019s \u201cForty Hadith: The Awaited Savior of Humanity\u201d.
