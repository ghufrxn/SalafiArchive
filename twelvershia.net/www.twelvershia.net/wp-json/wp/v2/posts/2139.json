It too is a fabricated text that has been attributed to an unknowing Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, such matters are rarely ever brought up by the common man in the modern Shia society, which causes doubts to lay rest. Luckily, one scholar, Mohammad Redha Al-Jalali in his book \u201cJihad Al-Imam Al-Sajjad\u201d p. 255, put in the effort of listing out the sources of this treatise. He lists out the following chains:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Al-Saduq from Ali bin Ahmad bin Musa from Mohammad bin Abi Abdullah Al-Kufi from Ja\u2019afar bin Mohammad bin Malik Al-Fazari from Khayran bin Dahir from Ahmad bin Ali bin Sulaiman Al-Halabi from his father from Mohammad bin Ali from Mohammad bin Fudhail from Abu Hamza Al-Thammali from Zainul Abideen. (Al-Khisal)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Al-Saduq from Ali bin Ahmad bin Musa from Mohammad bin Ja\u2019afar Al-Kufi Al-Asadi from Mohammad bin Isma\u2019eel Al-Barmaki from Abdullah bin Ahmad from Isma\u2019eel bin Al-Fadhl from Thabit bin Dinar Al-Thammali from Zainul Abideen. (Al-Faqeeh \/ Al-Amali)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- From Al-Najashi from Ali bin Ahmad from Al-Hasan bin Hamza from Ali bin Ibrahim from his father from Mohammad bin Fudhail from Abi Hamza from Zainul Abideen. (Rijal Al-Najashi)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first observation is that all three chains come through the path of one narrator: Abu Hamza Thabit bin Dinar Abi Safiyyah Al-Thammali. Al-Kashshi (p. 148) records from the Ali bin Al-Hasan bin Fadhal: Abu Hamza used to drink wine, and he was accused of such, but he left it before he died.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From him, we have two paths. One path is the path of Mohammad bin Fudhail, while the other is from Isma\u2019eel bin Al-Fadhl.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first path is weak because of Mohammad bin Fudhail himself. Al-Tusi weakened him in his Rijal (p. 343) for being weak, and accused him of extremism (p. 365).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the second path, the narrator from Isma\u2019eel, Abdullah bin Ahmad, is unknown. He has been declared as such by Ibrahim Al-Shabboot in his Dirasaat fi Mashyakhat Al-Faqeeh (p. 296). Another narrator, Mohammad bin Isma\u2019eel Al-Barmaki, has been weakened by Ibn Al-Ghadha\u2019iri (p. 97), but has been strengthened by Al-Najashi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Jalali then comments: Whatever the case, the number of narrations and paths to Abu Hamza, makes it unnecessary to look into the chains of this book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is as if Al-Jalali was talking about ten different paths, when in reality he is only talking about two. Both of which are weak, as we have proven above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, as we have pointed out in the beginning, this treatise is no different than the Tafseer of Al-Askari, Fiqh Al-Redha, and all the other texts which have been attributed to the twelve Imams that have reached us through the paths of fabricators and unknown narrators.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a criticism of the authenticity of the \u201cTreatise of Rights\u201d (Risalat Al Huquq), the falsely attributed letter to Zain Al-Abideen, the fourth Imam.
