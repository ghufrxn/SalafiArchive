We will explain this advanced term for our readers in a very easy and beneficial way then compare its implications on both Sunni and Shia Hadith literature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elevated chain or Al-Isnad-ul-`Ali is considered from the strongest and most relied upon chains of transmission of narrations. To over simplify it, the difference between an elevated chain and a regular chain is that the elevated one contains less narrators. For example, if two major scholars existed in the same time, both of them were narrating the same prophetic-tradition, yet one scholar has heard this report through the path of four men up to the Prophet (saw) while the other heard it through the path of six, then the scholar with the shorter chain would be the most sought after in his time, for a shorter chain means a narration is much more accurate and less likely to contain defects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The more people the chain contains, the more risk it faces in transmitting the original text safely without error and this is due to many logical reasons. From those reasons is that each narrator when receiving a report from his teacher and writing it down may accidentally mishear it completely or a certain part of it, he may misunderstand it and write it based on his own faulty understanding instead of transmitting it word for word, he may understand it perfectly yet commit a copyist error while writing it in his book and so on and so forth from an endless list of reasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was why scholars travel from city to city and from land to land in order to acquire the shortest chains possible and the nearest of chains to the Prophet (saw). We will give a detailed scenario below which if understood will clarify the entire matter perfectly if God wills.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the past, the city of Basarah contained a big scholar of Hadith called Abu `Isa, this man is the teacher of two students of knowledge called Zayd and `Amr. The teacher abu `Isa informs his students of narration that was being narrated by the top scholar of Baghdad called `Abdullah. Abu `Isa says to his two students that he is too sick and could not travel to Baghdad to hear this report, so he had sent another student of his called Muhammad who in turn heard this narration from `Abdullah in Baghdad and transmitted it back to him. Zayd and `Amr both hear this prophetic report from their teacher and learn it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Zayd wishes to narrate that report to his colleagues so he recites the following chain: I was told by abu `Isa (his teacher), from Muhammad (the student), from `Abdullah (in Baghdad), from Sa`id, from Ibn `Abbas, that the Prophet (saw) said so and so\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Amr being the better student, he is not satisfied with this, he is a young man who fears Allah and has great respect for the tradition of Rasul-Allah (saw), he knows that the way of the scholars of Hadith is to verify and seek the closest path to their beloved Prophet (saw), he wishes to feel the blessing of being nearer to Rasul-Allah\u2019s (saw) divine guidance so he decides to pack his bags and travel to Baghdad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After his journey of knowledge, `Amr returns and narrates a more solid and detailed version of that same report with the following chain: I heard `Abdullah (in Baghdad) say, I was told by Sa`id, from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet (saw) said so and so\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, `Amr has three people between him and the Prophet (saw) while Zayd has five and so all serious students of knowledge in Basarah will dismiss Zayd\u2019s narration and learn `Amr\u2019s Hadith since he has obtained an elevated chain.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elevation of the Isnad in the words of the scholars:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia scholar

The small number of reports he transmits from them shows that he had completely dismissed them and raises more question marks on his methodology which left us with a book, more than half of which is weak.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Imam\u2019s responsibility towards his Shia:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Imam of the time is present as a grace (lutf) for humankind and guiding them is his purpose and mission. Al-Hasan al-`Askari could have facilitated this process and made al-Kulayni\u2019s task of saving the Shia much easier if he had chosen one of the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first matter: The Imam takes the initiative and compiles the Hadith literature in a big book so that the nation may be guided through it, by doing so he would completely solve the problem of chains since there would be no need for a chain in this case and many copies of this book would be distributed in the lands the same way `Uthman sent copies of his official Mushaf after uniting the Muslims on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second matter: The Imam could have transmitted the Hadith literature to his closest and biggest companions and they in turn would transmit it to the Shia the same way Ja`far al-Sadiq offered his companions all the knowledge he received from his fathers then they transmitted it to his Shia. This way, there would be no need for chains composed of five and six men, al-Kulayni could have wrote a much smaller book with chains composed of only one or two individuals maximum, they are well known and reliable since they are the Imam\u2019s trusted companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no reason to transmit the traditions of infallible guides such as al-Sadiq or al-Baqir with long chains of non-infallible men unless al-Sadiq was the last of the Imams and their seal. However, we know that Imamah continued a long time after al-Sadiq and the Imams received all knowledge from their father al-Sadiq in a much more accurate and complete way than the likes of Zurarah or abu Baseer who are capable of error, forgetfulness or even lying.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Verifying the Shia Hadith literature through the Imam of the time:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Imams were to fail in fulfilling their responsibility, then comes the role of the leaders of the Shia such as Kulayni to carry-out the mantle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first mission: In this scenario it becomes al-Kulayni\u2019s duty to seek the emissaries and transfer the requests and pleas of all the Shia which would motivate the 12th Imam to gather all the Hadithi-literature he possesses and hand it to them in a very short time since he is capable of this miraculous work. This would not be an issue since we know that the hidden Imam used to receive many requests in all matters of religion and he would answer even the smallest of religious queries, he would also answer worldly requests such as interceding for his Shia and supplicating for them so that Allah may bless them or protect them or lighten their burdens.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second mission: If al-Kulayni did not think of the first method, then his second task would be harder. He must collect whatever reports are found in the books by himself and then after many years and when his book is complete, he must present this book to the hidden Imam through the emissaries and representatives. The Imam would then check the contents and weed-out all the false and fabricated narrations such as the narrations of Tahreef found in al-Kafi. This would not be unprecedented as the Shia have presented their books to the Imams before, such as `Ubaydullah bin `Ali al-Halabi and his book which he presented to al-Sadiq, or the books of the companions of al-Sadiq that were later presented to al-Rida so he may erase the fabrications of the extremists, or the books of Yunus bin `Abdul-Rahman and al-Fadl bin Shadhan who were presented to al-Hasan al-`Askari.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">An explanation for al-Kulayni\u2019s major\u00a0mistake:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Kulayni who was the leader of the Shia in his time as they described him has committed a big blunder; he has wasted the only chance the Shia had of verifying the validity and divinity of their Hadith-literature. We decided to try and explain why such an expert scholar of Hadith and a renowned Muhaddith would fall into basic mistakes that even a student of Hadith would not commit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First possibility: Al-Kulayni was not an expert scholar of Hadith nor was he even qualified for such a big task so he wasted twenty years of his life on copying many weak reports from unknown scholars and books instead of seeking the Imam of his time and his emissaries. This also means that the Shia simply praised him since they had no other choice because he was the author of their biggest and oldest book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second possibility: Al-Kulayni avoided narrating anything from the last couple of Imams such as al-Jawad, al-Hadi and al-`Askari because he knew they were nowhere near as knowledgeable as their fathers before them, this is why the Shia as a whole avoided narrating much from them since they had nothing to offer and this is reflected in Shia Hadith literature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third possibility: Al-Kulayni did not attempt to contact the emissaries or their representatives and ask them for this favor since he knew they were incapable of it because in reality, they\u2019re frauds and liars who only excel in robbing the Shia and producing scribbles of paper then claiming they received it from the hidden Imam. Due to al-Kulayni\u2019s lack of trust and since he had no other choice, he ended up having to collect the old Shia narration from the time of al-Sadiq and al-Baqir.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Uluw-ul-Isnad in Sahih al-Bukhari:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Muhammad bin Isma`eel al-Bukhari [194-256 hijri] is arguably the greatest scholar of Hadith according to Ahlul-Sunnah and the author of their most authentic book after Allah\u2019s book. The author al-Bukhari did not believe in the infallibility of anybody after the chosen Messenger peace be upon him, so his goal was not to narrate with short chains from Ja`far bin Muhammad or his father. There are 183 years between al-Bukhari and our infallible guide Muhammad bin `Abdillah (saw) yet al-Bukhari was able to narrate with chains as short as three links between him and the Prophet (saw).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sahih al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0643\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644 :\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0628\u064a\u062f \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0633\u0645\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a \u2013 \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u2013 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We were told by Makki bin Ibrahim, he said: Yazid bin abi `Ubayd told us, from Salamah, he said: I heard the Prophet (saw) etc\u2026]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sahih al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u064a\u0633\u0649 \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0633\u0645\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0646\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0631\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 :\u0646\u0632\u0644\u062a \u0622\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0628<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We were told by Khallad ibn Yahya: `Isa bin Tahman told us, he said: I heard Anas ibn Malik say: The verse of the veil had descended etc\u2026]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sahih al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0633\u064f\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f \u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064d\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0634\u064f\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064e\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0633\u064d\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0651\u0650<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We were told by Sulayman bin Harb, he said: Shu`bah told us, from Qatadah, from Anas, from the Prophet (saw) etc\u2026]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sahih al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0648 \u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064d\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0632\u064f\u0647\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064c\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650\u0628\u064d\u060c \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064e<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We were told by `Amro bin Khalid, he said: Zuhayr told us, he said: abu Ishaq told us, from al-Bara\u2019 bin `Azib: That the Prophet (saw) etc\u2026]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most traditions in al-Bukhari are composed of four to five men.
