That article should be reviewed to see the major difference between the so called \u201cSunni Tahreef\u201d and the Shia Tahreef. We have also written a few articles on certain Shia scholars and their clear\u00a0opinions\u00a0concerning Tahfreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a sad fact that Shias often confuse certain aspects of Qur\u2019anic sciences. Due to the complex nature of the documentation and the revelation of the Qur\u2019an, Shias have made false claims time and time again. Often, we find hypocrisy, since these claims are a lot closer to home than they think. Yet, they choose to argue that variant recitations and abrogated verses are actually Tahreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, we will soon observe that Shias have continuously\u00a0accused Sunnis of the opinion of Tahreef Al-Qur\u2019an, when in reality they are referring to verses that have been abrogated in recitation. The difference between the two cases is that the former view implies that man was the cause of the removal or change in the Qur\u2019an, while the latter implies that Allah alone caused such a change. The difference between the two opinions is the difference between Islam and disbelief.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have divided the article as follows for easy reading:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abrogation of Verses<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Examples of Abrogated Verses<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Background on the Recitations of the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Did the Recitations come from the\u00a0Reciters, the Prophet, or Allah?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Is it Permissible to recite with a Recitation that goes Against the Uthmani Script?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Examples of Authentic Variant Recitations<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Companions Accuse the Compiler of the Qur\u2019an of Making Mistakes<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Allah&#8217;s name we begin,<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abrogation of Verses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah (subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala) says in the Holy Qur\u2019an:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0646\u0633\u062e \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0646\u0646\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0623\u062a \u0628\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0647\u0627<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Whichever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. (2:106)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scholars have observed three kinds of abrogation. The first is the abrogation of the ruling alone. The second is the abrogation of the ruling and the recitation. The third is the abrogation of recitation alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The existence in the abrogation of recitation is a commonly accepted view according to many Islamic scholars, even ones from outside the Sunni school. Jalal Al-Deen Al-Suyuti in his Al-Itqaan quotes several examples of this form. Such narrations usually include a companion saying, \u201cWe used to read such and such during the life of the Prophet.\u201d When returning to the Qur\u2019an, we do not find these verses within it. Scholars refer to such as an abrogation of verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the abrogation of recitation has been something that has always been accepted by Muslim scholars, we do find that there are some that have doubted the existence of it. Their main argument is that they do not see the wisdom of such a thing and that abrogation of recitation creates nothing but confusion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, such an argument holds no weight, since it is not required for the creation to understand the wisdom of the actions of Allah as a requirement to accepting those actions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Sulaiman Al-Lahim, in his introduction to Al-Nahhas\u2019 Al-Nasikh wal Mansookh (1\/118), one of the wisdoms of the existence of the abrogation of recitation is that it makes the Qur\u2019an easier to memorize. He quoted the following verse:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u062e\u0641\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0636\u0639\u0641\u0627<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the present Allah has made light your burden, and He knows that there is weakness in you. (8:66)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By returning to the context of the verse, we find that Allah is decreasing what He expects from the Muslims at war. This is indeed a mercy upon them, for they were expected to stand up to armies that are up to ten times in number, but then the number was decreased to twice in number.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, the abrogation of those verses is a form of mercy as well, since Allah&#8217;s words can never run out, and having the Qur\u2019an in its final state makes it easier to memorize than what it could have been if no abrogation of recitation existed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Suyuti in Al-Itqan (p.470) quotes Ibn Al-Jawzi for another benefit of the existence of the abrogation of recitation, which is that it personifies the obedience of the Ummah in following the teachings of Allah, even without absolute certainty, and this is similar to how Ibrahim (alaihi alsalam) accepted that he had to kill his son, even though it was just a dream as certain as he would have been if he received such an order through an angel. This type of acceptance of the rulings of Allah (i.e. via abrogation verses, and Ibrahim\u2019s acceptance of his dream) demonstrates a high level of faith and deserves a higher reward. This is why some teachings were revealed as Qur&#8217;an while others came in the form of Sunnah, Allah wishes to test this nation through the Sunnah and see how they deal with its texts,\u00a0how they\u00a0study it, preserve it and deal with the differences of opinions among themselves in an Islamic manner.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Examples of Abrogated Verses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Ubai bin Ka\u2019ab suggests that Surat Al-Ahzab was at one time as long as Al-Baqara.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration, from Musnad Ahmad #20261, is as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cFrom Zir, he said: Ubai said to me: How do you read Surat Al-Ahzab or how long is it? I said: Seventy three verses. He said: I saw it when it was as long as Al-Baqara, and we read from it: If the old man\u00a0and the old woman\u00a0commit adultery then stone them, a preventative measure from Allah, and Allah is the All-wise and All-knowing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We comment: If the narration implies Tahreef, then why didn\u2019t Ubai teach the verses as a part of the Qur\u2019an? He was a famous teacher of the Qur\u2019an, and he even taught it to Ibn Abbas, Abu Huraira, Abu Abdulrahman Al-Sulami, Abdullah bin Sa\u2019ib and Abdullah bin Ayyash, and yet, none of his students have documented this verse as a part of it. The conclusion is simple; it is that he believed that this verse was abrogated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: For more on this topic, refer to our article that exposes <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/09\/19\/response-to-the-collection-and-preservation-of-the-quran\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">the hypocrisy of Al-Khoei<\/a>, who attributes the view of abrogation to the Imams, while simultaneously accusing Sunnis of holding the view and interpreting it as Tahreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Another famous example is Al-Bukhari #2286. The narration is a quote by Abu Musa Al-\u2018Ash\u2019ari in which he said that a verse once existed in the Qur\u2019an that goes as follows: \u201cIf there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust.\u201d The same verse is recited by Ubai bin Ka\u2019ab and Ibn Mas\u2019ud. Yet, even though they all used to recite this verse in the past, each of them has stopped doing so, and they did not teach this verse as a part of the Qur\u2019an. This, once again, is clear evidence that abrogation has occurred to this verse and the Surah that it belonged in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we have stated before, Ubai taught Ibn Abbas, Abu Huraira, Abu Abdulrahman Al-Sulami, Abdullah bin Sa\u2019ib and Abdullah bin Ayyash, and yet, he didn\u2019t teach these verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Mas\u2019ud taught Alqama, Al-Aswad, Masrouq, Zir, Zaid bin Wahb, Abu Amr Al-Shaybani, and Abu Abdulrahman Al-Sulami, and didn\u2019t teach these verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ari taught Abu Raja\u2019a Al-Atardi and Hitan bin Abdullah, and never taught these verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is clear that they intentionally didn\u2019t teach these verses, since they believed that they were abrogated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`A&#8217;ishah says about this in Musnad abi Ya`la:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0641\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064f\u0633\u0650\u062e\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0622\u0646\u0650<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;We believed that it was from what was abrogated from the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Another one of our favorite examples is the abrogation within the verse of Mutah. Refer to <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/02\/12\/prohibition-mutah-marriages\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">this article<\/a> for more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Also, refer to our article on the verse about suckling and its abrogation: <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2013\/07\/20\/response-to-open-challenge-to-the-sons-of-aisha\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Response to: Challenge to the Sons of Aisha.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also important to add that abrogations are not exclusive to Ahl Al-Sunnah. By returning to Al-Idda and we have found a clear statement from Al-Tusi regarding the permissibility of this form of abrogation. In Chapter 7, he calls Section 4:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0641\u064a \u0630\u0643\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u062e \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0651\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629 \u060c \u0648\u0646\u0633\u062e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0651\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe permissibility of the abrogation of laws without recitation and the abrogation of recitations without laws.\u201d We suggest that readers read the full chapter in order to see Al-Tusi\u2019s reasons for accepting these forms of abrogation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the above is clear, one can easily determine when a narration falls under the category of abrogation. Surely, it is nothing compared to the Tahreef that the Shias believe in where the names of the Ahlulbayt are removed by the Sahaba.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Background on the Recitations of the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The matter of the various recitations of the Qur\u2019an may be confusing to some. Yet, by understanding the origins and reasons for the existence of such a matter will make things much clearer to all readers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4608 and Saheeh Muslim #1354 we find that after the conquest of Makkah, Omar bin Al-Khattab spotted Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam reading Surat Al-Furqan in a different method than which he used to read it in. He dragged Hisham to the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) and made him read it. The Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) agreed to the recitation of both men and said that the Qur\u2019an was revealed in seven Ahruf (plural of Harf, meaning Wajh = way).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A questioner may ask: Aren&#8217;t both Umar and Hakeem from Quraysh, if so why did they recite differently? The answer is that Hakeem embraced Islam very late, it was after the conquest of Makkah as opposed to Umar, so Hakeem may have heard non-Qurashi recitations. In fact, Hakeem may have been taught some verses by non-Qurashi reciters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Tafseer al-Tabari 1\/23, Zayd bin Arqam tells his companions in the Masjid that a man once came to the Prophet (saw), he said: &#8220;`Abdullah bin Mas`oud taught me a Surah which I heard from Ubay bin Ka`b and Zayd but their recitations differed, which do I take?&#8221; The Prophet (saw) remained silent and `Ali was sitting besides him. `Ali answered him: &#8220;Let each man recite as he was taught, all are beautiful and good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also in al-Tabari 1\/32, Ubay was in the Masjid, he said: when a man entered to pray and he recited in a way that I rejected, then another entered and he recited a different recitation that I also rejected. We all entered upon the Prophet (saw) and Ubay told him so the Prophet (saw) accepted both their recitations, then said: O Ubay, it was said to me to recite the Qur&#8217;an in one way(Harf) so I replied: &#8220;O Lord make it easy for my nation.&#8221; and this happened more than once until it was said: &#8220;Recite in seven Ahruf(ways).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In another narration in Sunan Al-Tirmithi #2868 from Ubai bin Ka\u2019ab we find the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) saying, \u201cO Jibreel, I was sent to an Ummah of those that are illiterate, among them are old women, old men, slaves, children, and men that never read a word,\u201d Jibreel replied, \u201cO Mohammad! The Qur\u2019an was revealed under seven Ahruf.\u201d Al-Tirmithi says that this narration is Hasan Saheeh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Saheeh Muslim #1355, Ibn Abbas narrates that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) kept asking Jibreel to add more to the recitation of the Qur\u2019an until he reached seven variations. In Tafseer al-Tabari Ibn Shihab says: &#8220;I heard that these seven ways\u00a0are always related to one matter and do not differ in Halal or Haram.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By examining these narrations and those like it, we come to realize that the existence of such variations was a mercy for the Ummah and that it allowed people to be able to read the Qur\u2019an all over Arabia with their mother-tongue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In summary, different Arabs from different tribes were having difficulty in reciting verses from the Qur\u2019an in the tongue of Quraish. For example, the term Buyoot (Houses), in some recitations, is pronounced as Biyoot. Even though many people have no problem with either recitation today, we find that even great Qur\u2019anic scholars in the past like Abu Bakr bin Al-Arabi the Maliki Andulusian scholar was not able to recite it in the latter fashion. (Refer to Kashf Akatheeb Zakariah Butrus wa Amthaluhu Hawl Al-Qur\u2019an Al-Kareem p. 80) If that was the case with a scholar of the Qur\u2019an, then one can only imagine how much harder it would\u2019ve been for old men, women, and sheepherders of the first Islamic century to go against their mother tongues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sh. Hasan Dhiya\u2019a Al-Deen Itir, the author of \u201cAl-Ahruf Al-Saba\u2019a\u201d indicates that there were many differences in the Arabian tongues, in which Arabs would pronounce words differently in their Harakaat, in the inclusion of a Haraka or a Sukoon, in the actual changing of letters, in the inclusion of a Hamza in place of a Waaw or Yaa\u2019, in the changing of the positions of letters, in the addition or removal of letters, in the tone of letters with the Alif, in the masculinisation and feminization of words, in the I`iraab, in the version of plurals, in the way one ends a sentence with a Taa\u2019, and others. Refer to pages 24-26 for examples.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, these examples may be lost upon those that have not practiced the Arabic tongue, however, we still find versions of these today where we find words like \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a Al-Ladhi being pronounced by Egyptians as Al-Lazi \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a and as Ilee \u0625\u0644\u064a by the Arabs of the GCC or as Yallee \u064a\u0644\u064a in the Levant. In all cases, these are the same words, but pronunciations\u2019 differ and yet, are still all a part of the Arabic language.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, it becomes clear that the existence of such variations did make the Qur\u2019an much easier to read for outsiders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sh. Hasan Dhiya\u2019a Al-Deen Itir (p. 214 \u2013 228) also includes that the existence of the variations of recitations led to many benefits apart from the care that the Arabs received from it, this included that the Qur\u2019an became easier to memorize, which led to make the da\u2019awa easier, and that such a matter was a form of I\u2019ijaaz that the Kuffar could not imitate. Moreover, it proved that the Qur\u2019an is from Allah, since no book can be revealed in such a variety and yet, not fall into contradiction. Furthermore, it led to unity amongst the Arabs through their tongues. Do note that even though the variations do often focus on the differences in the tongues of the Arabs, but it also includes other differences in recitation that do not fall into such. Refer to p. 220.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What did cause confusion to some though was the fact that we find some recitations attributed to companions today that do not exist in the current recitations of the Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the scholars of the Qur\u2019an, we find that this occurred during the time of Uthman when Islam was starting to spread vastly. We saw above examples of how the Prophet (saw) taught his Companions that difference in recitation is a mercy and that all have their sanctity. However, people in the distant lands that embraced Islam after many years from the Prophet&#8217;s (saw) death had no knowledge of this and so they\u00a0would often challenge each other\u2019s recitations claiming that their recitation is better than the recitation of others. Such claims are Haram and are very dangerous since all these recitations were from Allah. Due to this, Uthman ordered all personal copies of the Qur\u2019an to be burned and spread a Qur\u2019an that was void of major changes in the writing of the text in order for the differences to be minimal. More importantly, he instructed the writers to heavily rely on\u00a0the tongue of Quraish but in a way that made it possible for the letters of the words to hold more than one recitation. Due to this, one could read the word \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 as \u0645\u0644\u0643 when it is only written as \u0645\u0644\u0643, since the writing can hold the letter Alif. Due to this method, one can read the Qur\u2019an through several different Ahruf while still sticking to one text. Moreover, the differences between different townspeople would decrease since they are all referring to the Masahif of Uthman.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ali orders his followers in the authentic narrations to never criticize Uthman for burning the Masahif since he did this after consulting them and the majority agreed with his decision. Burning those Masahif\u00a0may have led to losing some forms of recitation for some of the verses but this does not conflict with Allah&#8217;s promise to protect the Qur&#8217;an, since those recitations are only additional tools for convenience. Therefore, preserving one recitation\u00a0is sufficient for the Qur&#8217;an to be preserved. The ten Qira&#8217;aat\/recitations that are relied upon today are a mixture of the seven Ahruf\/ways in which the Arabs memorized\u00a0the Qur&#8217;an. The ten recitations take special care to stick as closely as possible to the Uthmani script to avoid any of the problems that emerged\u00a0in Uthman&#8217;s era.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The topic is wide and may be confusing, so we suggest those fluent in Arabic to return to the following books for a more complete explanation:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Al-Ahruf Al-Saba\u2019a by Hasan Dhiya\u2019a Al-Deen Itir<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Al-Ibana by Makki bin Abi Talib<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Al-Juman fi Uloom Al-Qur\u2019an v.2 by Adil Hasan Ali<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Rasm Al-Masahif by Al-Farmawi<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Munjid Al-Muqri\u2019een by Al-Jazari<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- Kashf Akatheeb Zakariah Butrus wa Amthaluhu Hawl Al-Qur\u2019an Al-Kareem<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, one of the most infamous Shia propagation sites, ShiaPen, have made use of narrations in which we find different Qira\u2019aat in order to attack the Sunni position, by accusing Sunnis of believing in Tahreef.

According to Al-Tabrasi, this is not Tahreef, but merely a different recitation.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Did the Recitations come from the Reciters or from Allah? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahl Al-Sunnah are\u00a0unanimous that the recitations come from Allah alone, but there is a difference of opinion amongst Shias as to the source of these recitations. Al-Khoei argues that they are from the reciters and that they do not hold weight and they are not considered to be part of the Qur\u2019an. He is criticized by the Shia scholar Abdul Hadi Al-Fadhli in his Al-Qira\u2019aat Al-Qur\u2019aniya (p. 82) who accepts the Sunni position that the recitations are from Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The simplest evidence that the recitations are from Allah is the fourth verse from Surat Al-Fatiha, where we find the word: <strong>Maalik (<\/strong><strong>\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643<\/strong><strong>).<\/strong>\u00a0Most Muslims today read it as such and this was how it was read by \u2018Asim, Al-Kisa\u2019ee, Ya\u2019qoub, and Khalaf. However, it is reported from\u00a0Nafi\u2019, Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr, Ibn Amer, Hamza, and Abu Ja\u2019afar Al-Madani, that they have all recited it as <strong>Malik (<\/strong><strong>\u0645\u0644\u0643<\/strong><strong>). <\/strong>From this, we understand that the reciters did not simply make an error by reciting it differently, for the majority of them read Malik (\u0645\u0644\u0643), not just one or two. This recitation, is furthermore, <em>mutawatir<\/em> not only from them and the companions of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , but from the Prophet himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it inconceivable for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 to only recite one version, in this most important Surah, and have the majority of the people make a mistake. Not a single Muslim child today would make such a mistake, let alone those that dedicated themselves to preserving the Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, we easily re-affirm the position of Ahl Al-Sunnah that the variant recitations are from Allah alone.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Is it Permissible today to recite with a Recitation that goes Against the Uthmani Script?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scholars of Ahl Al-Sunnah unanimously agree that it is not permissible to do so in our days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their reasoning is simple. Uthmani script is Mutawatir whereas the recitations that do not agree with it only reach us through some individual narrations here or there. There is always a possibility of a mistake in a recitation when it comes through a single narrator and contradicts the Uthmani script. Due to this, scholars are extra careful and go the extra mile by declaring such recitations: <em>shaath <\/em>(irregular).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is important to be aware that Ibn Shanbuth, a scholar of the Qira\u2019aat (d. 328 AH), was one of the few scholars that held the opinion that reciting the Qur\u2019an through such variations was acceptable, even if they were not Mutawatir. Abu Al-Qasim Al-Zinji narrates that he was at the meeting place in which Ibn Shanbuth admitted in front of a group of scholars and Ibn Muqla the minister that he read the verse \u201c&#8230;on every <u>serviceable<\/u> boat by force&#8230;\u201d (18:79) (see Ma\u2019rifat Al-Qura\u2019a by Al-Thahabi p. 310-312). He admitted to reading these irregular recitations and was punished for doing so. There were no accusations of Tahreef from any of the scholars onto him, nor were there any accusations by him that the Muslims have tampered with the Qur\u2019an. He simply chose to recite a verse in a way that differed with the preserved Qur&#8217;anic text because he must have came across it through some narration by Ibn `Abbas and liked it, he did not say the preserved text was tampered nor did those who punished him claim that his irregular recitation is not from Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is in light of this, that Ahl Al-Sunnah are open to accepting that narrations are indeed authentically attributed to a companion, but will be careful and not recite it in prayer as a part of the Qur\u2019an just in case a narrator made a mistake.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Examples of Authentic Variant Recitations<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1- <\/strong>\u0639\u0646 \u200f \u200f\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u200f \u200f\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0646\u064a \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u200f \u200f\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645:\u200f \u200f\u0625\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0642 \u0630\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u064a\u0646<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Messenger of Allah taught me to recite<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong><em>\u201c<u>I am <\/u>the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong\u201d.<\/em><em> (51: 58)<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0631: \u0648\u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0643\u0639\u0628: \u064a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642 \u062f\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jarir said: \u2018I read it in Ubai bin Ka\u2019ab\u2019s Mushaf as \u2018Allah <u>the just<\/u> will pay back to them their reward in full.

Though, like the earlier aspects of Qur\u2019anic sciences, this has got nothing to do with Tahreef. Moreover, there is a consensus amongst all Muslims that the Uthmani Script does not match the pronunciation of words.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An obvious example from the Qur\u2019an is the word: <em>\u2018Ula\u2019ika<\/em> (\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643). The correct pronunciation of this word is \u0623\u064f\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643 , however, a \u0648 was added to differentiate between it and other words like \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643. Do remember that dotting was not used in the earliest Qur\u2019ans.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another example is the word: Mi\u2019a (\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629). The correct pronunciation is \u0645\u0626\u0629, however, an \u0623 was added to differentiate between \u0645\u0626\u0629 and \u0641\u0626\u0629.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One doesn\u2019t even need to go as far as the first page of the Qur\u2019an, the words: \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If one looks closely, one would realize that according to the agreed upon standards of pronunciation today, we would write: \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, to say that certain words in the\u00a0Qur\u2019an were incorrectly written does not indicate the belief in Tahreef, but rather, is a position that is very acceptable and rational.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have found though four different authentic (somewhat) examples of such statements that we would like to look deeper into.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Ibn Abbas would read \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0623\u0630\u0646\u0648\u0627 instead of \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0623\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0627, and would say that this is an error from the scribe. (24:27)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Ibn Abbas would read \u0623\u0641\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0628\u064a\u0646 instead of \u0623\u0641\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0627\u064a\u0626\u0633, and would say that the scribe made an error. (13:31)<\/p>\n<p>3- A\u2019isha was asked about a number of verses and she said that they are mistakes from the scribe.<\/p>\n<p>a) \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062e\u0648\u0646 4:162<\/p>\n<p>b) \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646 4:162<\/p>\n<p>c) \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0626\u0648\u0646 5:69<\/p>\n<p>d) \u0644\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646 20:63<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In short, with the exception of the (24:27) and (4:162), all of these verses do in fact go against the pronunciation of the words. We have provided the wording according to modern standards above, however, the Uthmani Script lists them as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u062e\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0644\u0633\u062d\u0631\u0646 &#8211; \u064a\u0627\u064a\u0626\u0633<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for (4:162), we find it matching with the pronunciation, so it is very possible that this was a general statement on part of A\u2019isha since she was simply responding to all these narrations by saying, \u201cThis is a mistake from the scribe,\u201d without specifying the mistakes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for (24:27), we find nothing in the verse that could be interpreted as a mistake in pronunciation. Though, we do find in Sa\u2019eed bin Mansour\u2019s exegesis of the Qur\u2019an 6\/409 that Ibn Abbas said, \u201cI think this may be a mistake from the scribe,\u201d suggesting that he is unsure if it is a recitation or not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another possible explanation for the above statements by A\u2019isha and Ibn Abbas is that they were simply not aware of the other recitations. As we have previously mentioned above, the view that the Uthmani Script goes against pronunciation is one that is agreed upon. With this in mind, they were very open to criticizing the script, since the Qur\u2019an is taught orally while the written text is a supplementary tool. With this in mind, it becomes understandable that they never held the untouchable view of the Uthmani Script that we hold today. This doesn&#8217;t mean they believe the Qur&#8217;an is tampered, for Ibn `Abbas says in the authentic narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a \u0623\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0632\u0650\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062f\u064e\u062b\u064f\u060c \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0621\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0636\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0628\u0652<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Qur&#8217;an) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (saw) is newer and the latest? You recite\u00a0it pure, undistorted and unchanged&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is important to keep in mind that this is not a belief in Tahreef, but rather, in this possibility, it is the belief that Zaid bin Thabit, under Uthman\u2019s supervision, erred in writing verses. Regardless, this does not taint the promise of Allah to keep the Qur\u2019an preserved, since people during their times did recite the Qur\u2019an in the same way that they (i.e. A\u2019isha and Ibn Abbas) recited, and it didn\u2019t matter if the state endorsed a script that contained errors, for people learned the Qur\u2019an orally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again, this view, if indeed held by A\u2019isha and Ibn Abbas, was held simply because they were not aware of the authenticity of the opposing recitation. This is unlike any statement of Tahreef, in which bad intentions to corrupt the religion of Allah is the reason as to why verses were changed and played around with. Once again, refer to our <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/07\/24\/authentic-shia-narration-declaring-the-corruption-of-the-quran\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">examples from authentic Shia sources.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another possibility that is mentioned by some Sunni scholars is that above narrations that are attributed to A&#8217;isha and Ibn Abbas are weak.
