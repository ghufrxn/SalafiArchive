These folks were even confused about the rules of their &#8220;Ghaybah&#8221;, they say there is a smaller one and a bigger one. The smaller Ghaybah is when the Mahdi had four emissaries and he used to send them letters to inform them of matters in politics and religion. The bigger Ghaybah is when humanity is cut-off completely from the Mahdi and no one gets to be in contact with him, YET you observe in many Shia books that their scholars are receiving letters from him and information as well as guidance, such as al-Mufid and his famous letters from al-Mahdi. May Allah help us from confusion in matters of religion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember O dear readers, when we used to show the Shia laypeople their narrations and the declarations by their scholars, that the 12th one has been hiding for 1,200 years out of fear from the rulers and their spear carrying soldiers? Well this caused some of their laypeople to change their beliefs concerning this issue, as their &#8220;intellect&#8221; could not accept that their miraculous virtuous savior was so scared that he remained in hiding for so long without helping his loyal followers in anything. How can they love someone who quietly watches as they suffer and die in confusion and he hides from fear for his own useless life? Would it not be more intellectual if Allah (swt) makes him appear and guide the nation as much as he can, with sincerity and sacrifice, then after he dies Allah sends another 13th one after him? Wasn&#8217;t this the case with the Prophets of bani Isra&#8217;eel? Bani Isra&#8217;eel are a nation who used to kill their prophets but Allah kept sending new ones to continue guiding humanity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These days the latest Shia fashion is that \u00a0they started calling his disappearance a &#8220;test&#8221;. This means that he is not hiding out of fear but is hiding because Allah ordered him to disappear to test the faith of his followers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other than the fact that this belief contradicts with their other beliefs such as &#8220;Lutf&#8221; or godly grace, we would like to show these folks a thing or two about their Madhab that they might have missed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In their book &#8220;Bidayat al-Ma`arif al-Ilahiyyah fi Sharh `Aqa&#8217;id al-Imamiyyah&#8221; by al-Sayyid Muhsin al-Khizari, 2\/148,\u00a0we read the words of al-Muhaqqiq Naseer-ul-Deen al-Tusi, a Shia scholar, he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u064a &#8211; \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 &#8211; \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0647 &#8211; \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 &#8211; \u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633\u060c \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u063a\u0644\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u062a\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0625\u0637\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u0644 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>[The Ghaybah of the Mahdi (as) is not from Allah (swt) nor from him (as) rather it is caused by those who are religiously accountable and by the people, it is caused by being overcome with fear and the inability of the people to obey the Imam.

The word &#8220;Hujjah of Allah&#8221; in the Islamic religion means the divine godly proof or godly argument that He (swt) issues to prove the truth from the falsehood. Allah (swt) sends the angels with divine messages for his chosen slaves so they can be prophets and so they can establish the Hujjah of Allah upon his creations, Allah says in his book:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>{[We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument(Hujjah) against Allah after the messengers. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.} [4:165]<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah (swt) sends them so that humanity cannot have an argument against their Lord on the day of judgement, for how can Allah throw us in the fire if he did not send us his divine godly proof and establish his godly argument on us through these chosen men? Then after that whoever rejects is deserving of an eternity in hell-fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia Mahdi is quite the opposite, he is the<strong> &#8220;Hujjah of the people against Allah after the messengers.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How you ask?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ali (ra) presented his version of the Qur&#8217;an which was perfectly complied in the acceptable order, it contained the abrogations and clarified them, it contained the detailed interpretation of every verse and its cause of revelation, the rulers reject `Ali&#8217;s (ra) book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahlul-Bayt then inherited this book until the 12th one was born, he then took it and disappeared.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when we are asked on the day of judgement why we strayed from truth we answer:&#8221;The Hujjah of Allah was absent.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May Allah (swt) save us from misguidance and confusion.
