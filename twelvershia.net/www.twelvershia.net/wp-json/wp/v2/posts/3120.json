The narration does not provide any information regarding any harm being done to those within the house, however, we cannot even accept that such an intrusion occurred.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Taymiyyah points out that this accusation cannot be accepted unless if comes through an authentic chain, and we know for a fact that Abu Bakr did not cause any harm to Ali or Al-Zubair or Sa\u2019ad bin Ubada. He then states that all that can be said is that Abu Bakr intruded into the house to check if there was any money that needed to be spent, though Ibn Taymiyyah is simply playing the devil\u2019s advocate, since he rejects the narration in the first place. See Minhaj Al-Sunnah 8\/290.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Slave of Ahlubait is successful in providing a chain for the hadiths that he found in Kitab Al-Amwal by Ibn Zanjawaih.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chain is obviously weak due to the weakness of Ulwan bin Dawud, who was weakened by Al-Bukhari, Ibn Yunus, and Al-Uqaili. Refer to Mizan Al-I\u2019itidal 5\/135.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Qutlubugha 7\/176 provides the same quotes from the previous three sources as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Al-Jawzi in his Al-Dhu\u2019afaa also quotes Ibn Yunus who weakened Ilwan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Slave of Ahlubait rejects these criticisms, suggesting that this opinion was falsely attributed to Al-Bukhari and Ibn Yunus, since none of their published books contain this information. This argument is baseless since such statements are accepted even without the publication of these books, for it is enough that they have been documented by late sources, and this is the methodology of the late hadith scholars in regards to <em>rijali<\/em> statements by early scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Slave of Ahlubait does argue that \u201c<span style=\"color: #800000;\">he is termed thiqa by ibn habban, though some people have criticized him but that is not explanatory enough.<\/span>\u201d However, as anyone who is experienced in hadith sciences knows, Ibn Hibban includes people in his book that he does not even know.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following article is a response to Slave of Ahlubait\u2019s \u201cAttack on house of bibi fatima; from sunni sources\u201d.
