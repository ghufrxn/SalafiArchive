The only matter that we find problematic is the title that Master_IER chose for the article, since it suggests that Imam Ahmad forbade narrating these traditions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"tm7\">The most obvious response to this is that Imam Ahmad himself taught this hadith by documenting it in his Musnad many times. He quoted hadith Al-Ghadeer many times in Al-Musnad (#641, #950, #961, #1311, #3061, #18479, #19279, #19302, #19325, #19328, #22945, #23107, #23143, #23563). He did the same with Hadith Al-Manzila (#1463, #1490, #1505, #1509, #1532, #1547, #1583, #1600, #1608, #3061, #11272, #14638, #27081, #27467). We can find Imam Ahmad teaching these narrations at least <\/span><u><span class=\"tm8\">sixty times <\/span><\/u><span class=\"tm7\"> in his books. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"tm7\">With this in mind, we come to the conclusion that Imam Ahmad\u2019s words, \u201cLeave it as it came,\u201d must have a different meaning.<\/span><strong><span class=\"tm11\"> It does not mean, \u201cDon\u2019t narrate it.\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"tm7\">In another context, Imam Ahmad uses the same words to describe some hadiths. Abu Bakr Al-Maruthi asked him about the narrations of the attributes of Allah, seeing Allah, the Isra\u2019a, and the throne of Allah. Imam Ahmad graded them as authentic, then said,<\/span><strong><span class=\"tm11\"> \u201cThe scholars have accepted them and we submit to these reports <\/span><u><span class=\"tm12\">as they came.<\/span><\/u><span class=\"tm11\">\u201d<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"tm7\"> (See Al-Sunnah by Al-Khallal ##283)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">We understand from this that when Imam Ahmad says, \u201cAs it came,\u201d or \u201cleave it as it came,\u201d then it means that he accepts the report and does not interpret it to hold any other meanings other than the apparent meaning. In other words, when speaking of the narrations of the merits of Ali, he is telling his students to accept the report as a merit of Ali, but to not interpret it or use it to suggest anything other than the apparent meaning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal tm6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"tm7\">As we all know, Shias use these reports to suggest that the rightful successorship of Ali. Some go further to suggest that these refer to his infallibility. Neither of these two reports suggest this, but they <\/span><strong><span class=\"tm11\">can<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"tm7\"> be incorrectly interpreted to mean this. It is due to this that Imam Ahmad taught to accept these reports \u201cas they came,\u201d without the false interpretations. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Response to: \u201cShhh!
