In the process, SoA makes the argument that Sunnis have tampered with the narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In short, the weak narration can be found in Musnad Abi Ya\u2019ala, and within it we find that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) asks Allah to damn two men. In Al-Suyuti\u2019s Al-La\u2019aali\u2019 Al-Masnoo\u2019a, he damns Mu\u2019awiyah and Amr bin Al-Aas. This has led SoA to the conclusion that Sunnis have tampered with their books.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA argues:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">look carefully, in the very beginning sayooti said it is from abu yala <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">and he mentioned the names as mawia and amr bin aas<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that Abu Ya\u2019ala had more than one book. In fact, the published copy of Al-Musnad by Abu Ya\u2019ala that has arrived to us today is a much shortened version of what was available to scholars in the past. See Siyar A\u2019alam Al-Nubala\u2019a 1\/861.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, there are other evidences that suggest that this is a different hadith, including the fact that there are variations in the text that are irrelevant to Nasibi inclinations. These include one version including that this happened during travels, when the other doesn\u2019t. One version says that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) heard two people singing, while the other says he heard the sound of singing. One version includes a line of poetry, while the other doesn\u2019t. Also, the second narration includes Ali bin Al-Munthir as the shaikh of Abu Ya\u2019ala and the removal of Abu Hilal from the chain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As any objective reader can see, this hadith is a different hadith from the first. Therefore, it is not fair to accuse modern publishers, scribes, or anyone for tampering with the book of Abu Ya\u2019ala, since there are no evidences of this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; was not known for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2017\/09\/15\/lanat\/\"><em>lanat<\/em><\/a>, which is additional proof that such narrations should not be accepted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: Prophet asws Curses Mawia, Sunni Scholars Hide the Name.
