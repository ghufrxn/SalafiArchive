This is far from the case. Abu Bakr and the whole community accepted the trustworthiness of Fatima, but he denied her Fadak by telling to her that she was not aware that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 wanted his inheritance to go to charity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fatima did not retaliate by saying that her father promised her an inheritance, so it never led to anyone accusing the other of lying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, the whole situation of Fadak cannot be compared to the caliphate of Ali, for there were supposedly tens of thousands of people that witness the alleged appointment of Ali.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, when one usurps the leadership of an appointed ruler, the wronged ruler\u2019s wife does not simply go to the current tyrant and requests that he abdicate his throne. This fictional suggestion would not make sense in any novel, film, or video game.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to Hasan Molai\u2019s \u201cWhy abu bakar did not give fadak to bibi fatima asws?\u201d The article can be found on Slave of Ahlubait\u2019s blog and the Wilayat website.
