So He said: Be watchful o Humaira that it is not You. Then He turned to Imam Ali. And said: O Ali! If you are the Wali of Her Amr, be gentle\u2026\u2026\u2026..<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: The hadith is weak due to the disconnection between Salim bin Abi Al-Ja\u2019d from Um Salama. The authors of Jami\u2019 of Tahseel and Tuhfat Al-Tahseel have provided quotes from earlier scholars that Salim&#8217;s narrations from A\u2019isha and Abu Huraira are disconnected, suggesting that he was not in Madinah while they were alive. They also said that \u201cothers\u201d have said that he didn\u2019t meet Um Salama, which is logical since Um Salama died around the same time as A\u2019isha.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Hakim authenticated the narration and said that it is upon the conditions of the Saheehain. However, this is a mistake on his behalf since Al-Bukhari didn\u2019t include Ammar Al-Duhani nor Abd Al-Jabbar bin Al-Ward in his book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SlaveOfAhlubait, in response to our brother from YouPuncturedTheArk (another Sunni website), said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Keep in mind Dhabi did not weaken anyone including Abdul Jabbar, who is Ibn al-Ward&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">As regards to Narrator Ammar ibn Muawia al-Duhani, He was Trustworthy in view of Abu Hatim al-Razi, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Nisai, Yahya ibn Maeen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This response of SlaveOfAhlubait is irrelevant. The purpose of stating that these two narrators are not \u201cupon the conditions of the Shaikhain\u201d, is not to suggest that they are weak, but rather to show that Al-Hakim was erroneous in his examination of the narration. Since that is the case, he should not be trusted in his grading of the narration. In this case, the issue with the narration is the disconnection, not the reliability of Abd Al-Jabbar or Ammar Al-Duhani.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the wording of the narration, we have no issue with it, for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 warned his wives by suggesting that the dogs of Al-Haw\u2019ab will bark at one of them. In other words, we are aware, and authenticate the narration that includes a vague warning towards the wives (in which A\u2019isha is intended), while we have our doubts about the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 being specific about the warning, since it has not arrived us through an authentic and connected chain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cO Ayesha!
