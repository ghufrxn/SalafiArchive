From these attempts is the story of Talout in Surat al-Baqarah, the Shia will claim that he was appointed yet he wasn&#8217;t a prophet therefore he must be what they consider a Shia Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we begin dear reader, we must clarify that the word Imam according to the Arabs means &#8220;One who is followed.&#8221; Thus Arabs would refer to those in positions of authority as Imams whether they be messengers, prophets, kings or even the man leading the prayer. The Shia however, whenever they utter the word Imam they usually refer to a very special case linked to their own beliefs, Imams according to them are successors of prophets, they are immune to error, they are divinely appointed by religious text, they have complete knowledge of all religious rulings, they are from a chosen progeny, they are tasked with guiding humanity, they have absolute authority over all mankind, they are greater than prophets, they can do miracles, etc&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So from the start we notice that the word Imam according to the Arabs has a famous usage\u00a0whereas for the Shia the word Imam means something completely different. The purpose of this article is to find out whether King Talout whom the Shia use as an excuse to prove their beliefs is an Imam according to their own understanding of that term or not, if he isn&#8217;t then the whole argument falls apart.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the name of Allah we begin,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first difference is that unlike the Shia Imams, Talout was only chosen because the people from banu Isra&#8217;eel asked their prophet Shamu&#8217;eel (as)\u00a0to ask Allah to appoint a man to lead them into battle. They would refer to their leaders as kings and each tribe had a king and so the kings were by the dozens and they would lead their people to battle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs, &#8220;Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah &#8220;? He said, &#8220;Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?&#8221;} [2:246]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah didn&#8217;t appoint him to guide humanity, if the people never asked for a military leader he wouldn&#8217;t have been appointed. Similarly, our Prophet (saw) would appoint many military leaders during his life, such as `Amr ibn al-`Aas, Khalid ibn al-Waleed and `Umar ibn al-Khattab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second difference is,\u00a0Nowhere was it reported that Talout succeeded the prophet of his time, he simply led people into that single battle during the Prophet-hood of another man,\u00a0then Dawoud (as) became a prophet and the king of banu Isra&#8217;eel during that same battle when he killed Jalout so Talout was never heard from again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{So they defeated them by permission of Allah, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which He willed.} [2:251]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we can see, Talout was not succeeded by his son as the Shia claim for their own Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thirdly, as is known to all Muslims, prophets are higher than kings, since kings (politicians) must follow the example of the prophets. The prophet is the Imam of every king in his time and not the other way around because the Shia claim that Imamah is greater than prophet-hood. This was why Talout was simply following the instructions of the prophet of his time as opposed to Shia beliefs. We read in their own books that\u00a0it was narrated by al-Sadiq in al-`Ayyashi and al-Majma` that in their time the king was the one whose job was to lead the armies while the Prophet would give him legitimacy and prophesy to him and reveal to him whatever came from his Lord:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0627\u0634\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a \u064a\u0642\u064a\u0645 \u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0628\u0626\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0631\u0628\u0647<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fourthly, Banu Isra&#8217;eel had two famous households and we read in the Shia book Tafseer al-Qummi:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0625\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0635\u064a \u0648\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0639\u062a\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0631\u0628\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0646\u0628\u064a \u064a\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0639\u0648\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0631\u0648\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0641\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0637 \u0641\u0623\u0630\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0644 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u062e\u0631\u062c\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621\u200c\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0641\u0641\u0632\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0628\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0633\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0628\u0639\u062b \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0627\u064b \u0646\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[From abi Baseer from abu Ja`far (as): After Musa (as), Banu Isra&#8217;eel committed sins and changed Allah&#8217;s religion.

it was a miracle by their prophet Shamu&#8217;eel (as) to prove his truthfulness about Talout being chosen by Allah when the people rejected him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And their

We read in Tafseer al-Tabari that Talout promised anyone who defeats Jalout the kingdom and the hand of his daughter, so when Dawoud (as) brought him the giant&#8217;s head, Talout turned back on his words:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0641\u0644\u0640\u0645 \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a \u0628\u062f\u0651\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0632\u0648\u0651\u062c\u0647. \u062b\u0645 \u0623\u062f\u0631\u0643\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0623\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0642\u062a\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f \u062d\u062a\u0640\u0649 \u0647\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0640\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0640\u062c\u0628\u0644\u060c \u0641\u0646\u0647\u0636 \u0625\u0644\u0640\u064a\u0647 \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a \u0641\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0631\u0647<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Talout found no other option than to grant him his daughter in marriage so he regretted making that promise, then he attempted to kill Dawoud (as) but he escaped from him to a\u00a0mountain, so Talout went in pursuit and surrounded him]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This story also proves that the Shia Imams were not chosen by Allah since we see in the story that if Allah decides to appoint a man as king then He will support him with miracles and grant him success until he reaches that status. Whereas, only the first two Shia Imams ruled and the ten others sat at home doing nothing. It also proves that the position of king is not necessary, since Allah never forced them to be ruled by a king, they were the ones who asked for it so Allah simply chose the man&#8217;s identity. We observe that Islam can thrive under any political system as long as it respects God&#8217;s laws and we are not bound only to kingdoms and monarchies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for those who claim the need of an invisible king\u00a0today (12th hidden Imam), ask yourself this question, what do we need him for? The Shia can live and thrive without him as we can see, they can print and publish books without him, they can teach their children and spread the narrations of their Imams without him, they can build strong economies and advanced armies without him and so on and so forth so what&#8217;s the need of this hidden king you bind yourselves to?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, the example of Talout has proven to be completely un-related to the Shia belief of Imamah and it differs from it greatly so ponder if you understand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The Shia look for random verses to try and make a link between their beliefs and Islam.
