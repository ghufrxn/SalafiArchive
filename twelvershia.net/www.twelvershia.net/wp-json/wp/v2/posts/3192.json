He (Abdullah) said, \u201cIbn Abbas asks your permission to enter, and he is one of your best sons.\u201d She said, \u201cLet me be away from Ibn Abbas and his praise.\u201d Abdullah bin Abdulrahman said, \u201cHe is a recitor of the Book of Allah, a scholar of the religion, so allow him to enter to greet you and to see you away.\u201d She said, \u201cAllow him in if you like.\u201d He was allowed in, and Ibn Abbas greeted her and sat down. He said, \u201cBe pleased O\u2019 Mother of Believers, for by Allah, there is nothing left between you and your freedom from the pain and fatigue and meeting the beloved, the Prophet and his party, other than your soul\u2019s deportation.\u201d She said, \u201cWhat else?\u201d He said, \u201cYou were the most loved of the Messenger of Allah\u2019s wives to him, and he wouldn\u2019t have loved anyone that was not good, and Allah \u2013 the Almighty \u2013 revealed your innocence from above the heavens, and there is no mosque on this earth that does not recite this night and day, and your necklace fell during the night of Al-Abwa\u2019a, which caused the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him \u2013 to stay in with the people who searched for it until the morning came and the people had no water, where in which Allah revealed: \u2018Betake yourselves to pure earth, then wipe your faces,\u2019 (Al-Nisa: 43) and this verse was a permission that was given to all the people which you were a cause of, for by Allah, you are blessed.\u201d She said, \u201cLet me be O\u2019 Ibn Abbas from all this, by Allah, I wish I was forgotten.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ari<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Bukhari in his Saheeh (#3159):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 said: There are many men that are complete, but the only women that were complete were Asiya the wife of the Pharaoh, and Maryam bint Imran, and A\u2019isha is to women as Thareed is to other dishes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: Abu Musa is a companion that is differed upon by Shias. Some have condemned him, while other scholars have praised him, like Ibn Dawud in his Rijal in the first section of his book, which includes the praised narrators and companions. In the eyes of Sunnis, we believe that Abu Musa was pro-Ali, for if he wasn\u2019t then he wouldn\u2019t have been sent as a representative of Ali after his war with Mu\u2019awiyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5565, Jabir narrated that a group of Jews pass by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 and say, \u201cAl-Saam (death) be upon you\u201d A\u2019isha cursed them intensely by saying, \u201cAl-Saam and curses be upon you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration demonstrates A\u2019isha\u2019s love for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; .
