Today InshaAllah, we try to introduce our readers to another popular Shia scholar who shares the same enmity and hatred towards the companions that he also adopted the belief of Tahreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sultan Muhammad bin Haydar Muhammad al-Janabidhi, also known as Sultan `Ali Shah the 14th century scholar who wrote the Shia Tafseer called &#8220;Bayan-ul-Sa`adah&#8221; in the year 1311 hijri.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Shi`ee begins his book by praising the Prophet (saw) and the Imams whom he describes as being eleven infallible leaders with the 12th\u00a0one being al-Qa&#8217;im al-Hujjah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then on page 19 of volume 1 he announces his beliefs in his own book of Tafseer:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>[Section thirteen:<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Regarding the additions and deletions and the tampering with the arrangement and the corruption and alterations that have taken place in the Qur&#8217;an we have with us, the Qur&#8217;an we were ordered to recite and obey and whose rulings we are to follow.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Know (O reader) that the narrations are\u00a0great in number\u00a0from the path of the pure Imams (as) which declare that additions and deletions and corruption and alteration have taken place in it, in such a way that leaves no doubt that some of it was actually uttered by them (as)]<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you can see, his opinion is quite clear in this matter. Al-Janabidhi then gives the other side of the argument, that people say that this corruption only happened to the interpretation\u00a0not the text and that the Qur&#8217;an was collected in the time of the companions and the Muslims took great care of it etc&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then comments on this explanation in the same page by saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>[What they mistakenly believed to be evidence for this, such as it (Qur&#8217;an) being collected in the lifetime of the Prophet (saw) according to them, and that they used to memorize it and study it, and that the companions were preserving it from change and alteration \u00a0in a way that they established the correct recitations. We answer by saying: As far as it being collected in his lifetime this is\u00a0disputable since it was being revealed until the end of his life, plenty of narrations state that parts of it were revealed in the last year. Rather they began collecting it after his death and `Ali was also busy in his house collecting it and this cannot be denied. As for them studying and memorizing it, we agree with this but they only studied and memorized that which was in their hands, as for them being concerned about preserving it and its recitations this was only after it was collected and arranged so just like some of them had intentions of preserving it, other hypocrites wanted to corrupt it.]<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Janabidhi says that\u00a0based on this\u00a0the Qur&#8217;an is unreliable but still\u00a0the Imams have ordered them to recite it, so does this mean it isn&#8217;t corrupted?\u00a0He answers:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>[It is obligatory to follow it (Qur&#8217;an) and obey its prohibitions and laws since many narrations mention what we have stated previously but not because what is\u00a0between the two covers is the (perfect) Book revealed on Muhammad (saw) without deletions, additions and corruption. We only benefit from such\u00a0narrations, that the additions and deletions and alterations if they took place in the Qur&#8217;an, do not corrupt the meaning of the rest of it. Rather I say, the most important function of the Book of Allah was pointing towards the `Itrah(Ahlul-Bayt) and to tell us to hold on to them, as for the rest it contained their Hujjah(argument). After holding\u00a0on to Ahlul-Bayt, if they should order us to follow it (the Qur&#8217;an) then it becomes a definite authority even if it was corrupted in a way that damages its meaning. On the other hand, if we did not hold on to Ahlul-Bayt or if they did not order us to follow the Book, then even if it weren&#8217;t corrupted in this case, yet by obeying\u00a0it and following its orders and extracting its rulings by our own personal effort we would be committing what they had prohibited, because they (as) prohibited us from interpreting it by our own opinions.]<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This part may have been a bit hard for some readers to understand. What the Shia scholar is saying here is that Ahlul-Bayt are the main purpose of the Book of Allah, they are the most important aspect of the religion and they told us that the Book is corrupted. If Ahlul-Bayt still tell us to hold on to the Qur&#8217;an even after knowing that it is corrupted then we must do as they say and it becomes a Hujjah upon us. If one does not hold on to Ahlul-Bayt, then the Qur&#8217;an is useless whether it was corrupted or not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, he mentions our old friend al-Fayd al-Kashani and his opinion in Tahreef that we discussed in an earlier article, he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>[In the introduction of the Tafseer of al-Fayd (ra) called &#8220;al-Safi&#8221; he gathered the narrations and opinions so whoever wishes can refer back to his book.
