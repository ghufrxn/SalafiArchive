They have went through so much trouble writing this article, and gathering scans, and yet, come up with the most fragile arguments. It saddens me when I calculate the amount of time wasted on this article.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this article, RTS attempts to demonstrate that Ahlul Sunnah take our\u00a0<em>deen<\/em>\u00a0from the\u00a0<em>nawasib<\/em>\u00a0(those that hate Ahlulbayt). Together, we shall examine the affect that their narrations have had on the two groups, the Sunnis and the Shias.\u00a0\u00a0First though, we examine RTS\u2019 intro:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Even if one was to belong to any of these factions, it does not negate the fact that there is a possibility of them speaking the truth pertaining to a certain matter during their life. However, if they were to speak in favour of their ideology, in other words, having a bias view, we would need to consider whether their statement would be true or not. Consider the Kuffar who would refer to the Prophet (saw) as being, &#8216;Just and Truthful&#8217;, would their statement be rejected although they spoke the truth about the Prophet (saw)? Would a Muslim reject the fact that the Prophet (saw) is Just and Truthful? Clearly not! In contrary to this, if the Kuffar had accused the Prophet (saw) of having received satanic verses, would a sane Muslim believe it to be true? Clearly not! The so-called &#8216;Ahl ul Sunnah&#8217; have too adopted this latter approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, this is a popular view among Sunni Hadith scholars. One can accept the narration of an innovator as long as it has nothing to do with his innovation. This, in reality, is the case with most of the narrations of the Nawasib, if not all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then argues:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Consider the well known narration in which Imam Alee (a.s) was accused of drinking alcohol and thereafter leading prayer in an intoxicated state. Such a narration was considered to be reliable according to classical scholars such as Suyuti and even modern day scholars such as Albani. If we refer back to the original narration, we find a sub-narrator known as &#8216;Aboo Abdurrahman Sulami&#8217; also known as Abdullah ibn Hubayb ibn Rabea. According to &#8216;Tahdhib Al-Tahdhib&#8217; by ibn Hajar Asqalani. Vol.5, Pg. # 184, it is stated he was an Uthmani. We shall deal with the Uthmani faction later on in the article, but it is suffice to say that they were amongst those who cursed and opposed Imam Alee (a.s).

Then the verse of: Don\u2019t approach prayers while being drunk, was revealed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First of all, there is nothing in the narration that implies ill-will towards Ali (ra), since the narrator clearly says that this was before the prohibition of alcohol, so Ali (ra) is not harmed by this narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, if we assume that this is a condemnation against Ali (ra) then we have to assume that it is a greater condemnation towards Abdulrahman bin Awf (ra), and Abdulrahman, as anyone that is familiar with Islamic history is aware, was responsible for the caliphate of Uthman (ra) himself, so he is more of an Uthmani than Abu Abdulrahman Al-Sulami, who RTS is condemning.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thirdly, the very Qur\u2019anic recitation of Ali (ra) that everyone reads today is the recitation of Abu Abdulrahman Al-Sulami, so if RTS does not want to accept his narration, then perhaps RTS should just look for an alternative Qur\u2019an other than the one the Muslims read today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues by defining what a Nasibi is, and is usually correct, however, makes a major mistake when attributing this statement to Al-Thahabi:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&#8220;From Naasb, comes the term Nasibi and they are hypocrites, they have made the hate of Alee as their religion.

It is a comment from the editor as we can see clearly from the screenshot on the RTS website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Now, we shall examine some of the narrators that are found in the books of Hadeeth within the so-called &#8216;Ahl ul Sunnah.&#8217;A point to note is that a Shi&#8217;ee will immediately criticize and reject narrations on the authority of such cursed individuals due to their belittlement of the Ahlulbayt (a.s). On the other hand, the &#8216;Ahl ul Sunnah&#8217; deem them to be reliable.

The eleventh is the narration of Musa and the rock (which is also narrated by Hammam bin Al-Munabih). The twelfth is that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) was sent amongst the best generation (the same chapter in Saheeh Muslim includes multiple narrations that support this).
