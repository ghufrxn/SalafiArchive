The first does not specify which form of muta\u2019a they were talking about. The second suggest that it was the muta\u2019a of hajj. The last is that it was the muta\u2019a of women.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is difficult to determine which is the intended meaning, since all of these narrations come through the path of Shu\u2019ba from Muslim Al-Qarri. The muta\u2019a of women can only be found in the narrations of Abu Dawud, while the muta\u2019a of hajj can only be found in the narrations of Rawh bin Ubada. The latter can be found in Saheeh Muslim #2176 and Mu\u2019jam Al-Tabarani 17\/5656. However, it seems as though the narrations of Rawh are more consistent when defining it as hajj, while the narrations of Abu Dawud, has referred to it as simply muta\u2019a without determining which kind. See Al-Mu\u2019jam Al-Kabeer 17\/5675. With this in mind, it seems as though the addition in the narration that this is the muta\u2019a of women is an addition made by Abu Dawud Al-Tayalsi himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, it simply does not make sense that Asma\u2019a bint Abi Bakr practiced muta\u2019a for two reasons. Firstly, she was a married woman even before leaving Makkah, and therefore, it is haram for her to perform muta\u2019a. Secondly, muta\u2019a was made permissible for men during military expeditions. See Saheeh Muslim 2493 from the hadith of Ibn Mas\u2019ud. Also it is authentically reported by ibn `Abbas that muta`a is only done in extreme cases during Jihad. Madinah wasn\u2019t the alternative \u201chalal\u201d orgy town that some cities in modern day Iran have sadly become. So, therefore, it is not logical for Asma\u2019a for have practiced this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cAsma bint Abu Bakar did Mutah\u201d.
