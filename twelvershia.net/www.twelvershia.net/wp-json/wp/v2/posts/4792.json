Essentially, they are claiming that it was impossible for Abu Hurayrah to have heard ~ 1,792 reports\/year from the Prophet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asides from the fact that there is no evidence to substantiate this claim, let us evaluate the Twelver double standard:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaber b. Yazid Al-Ju&#8217;fi (d. 128) was a prolific Shi&#8217;ite transmitter and an alleged student of Imam Al-Baqir. He was said to be an extremely prolific transmitter of the Imams such that he was granted access to some of their &#8220;secrets&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many reports did Jaber claim to transmit from Imam Al-Baqir? <span style=\"color:#cf2e2e\" class=\"color\"><strong>70,000<\/strong><\/span>! Al-Baqir&#8217;s Imamah started in 93 AH with the death of his father, and ended in 118 AH. This means that Jabir heard 70,000 reports over a span of 25 years&#8230;. 2800 reports\/year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not end there. As stated by \u0650Al-Hurr Al-&#8216;Ameli, Jaber transmitted around <span style=\"color:#cf2e2e\" class=\"color\"><strong>140,000 <\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#313131\" class=\"color\">reports in total <\/span><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1].<\/a> Al-&#8216;Ameli further states that Jaber was the most prolific transmitter from the Imams. If we were to be generous with Jaber and say that he lived for 70 years, this means that Jaber continuously heard 2,000 reports\/year since the day he was born! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is further ironic is that Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq, when asked about Jaber b. Yazid, is authentically quoted saying: &#8220;he only entered upon my father once, and he never entered upon me!&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=4792&amp;action=edit#_ftn1\">[2]<\/a>. The fact that an allegedly prolific transmitter from Al-Baqir only entered upon him once had Twelver scholars in circles. Eventually, they agreed to pull the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/25\/taqiyyah-hadith-the-no-true-scotsman-fallacy\/\">Taqiyyah card<\/a>&#8221; as a cop-out to pardon Jaber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example of this double standard is the authentic report in <em>Al-Kafi <\/em><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[3]<\/a>, which Al-Kulayni transmitted from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p> &#8216;Ali b.

Nevertheless, many students  of knowledge today complete reading Sahih Al-Bukhari (7000+ reports) in a few months; thus, it is not a mind-blowing catastrophe for a man who spent three years with the Prophet to transmit 5374 reports from him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, we find various Twelver authorities accepting much more significant feats in transmission from Twelver transmitters while objecting to Abu Hurayrah&#8217;s alleged transmission of 5374 reports in a period of three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This double standard should be a source of shame for every Twelver polemicist who has cited this baseless talking point in an attempt to implicate the innocent and truthful companion of the Prophet, Abu Hurayrah.  Any excuses\/cop-outs the Twelvers may cite to absolve their aforementioned transmitters can be cited to absolve Abu Hurayrah from the slander of the Shia today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Allah is the Witness of Abu Al-Abbas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> Al-Hurr Al-\u2018Ameli. <em>Wasa&#8217;il Al-Shia <\/em>ed.
