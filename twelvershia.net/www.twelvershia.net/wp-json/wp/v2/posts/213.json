Because there it is mentioned &#8216;Those who declare their wives as their mothers, and in fact they use false words, their mothers are only the ones who bore them.&#8217; In this situation, how can the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) be considered the mothers of the believers. This point should be noted in answering the question at hand that addressing a woman as mother is either due to biological relation, or spiritual relation. This meaning could be only in the case of biological relation, and this is the same thing which is mentioned in the earlier verses, that a person&#8217;s biological mother is only the one who bore him. But the spiritual mother and father are those who have a kind of special right over them, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) is considered the spiritual father of the nation, and due to him, his wives hold the respect which a mother holds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tafsir Namoona, Vol. 17, p. 180<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4.

But Shi&#8217;ism is a unique cult, where every non-Shia is considered a bastard, so we can expect nothing good from this cult.

There are various reports, ranging from her marriage with the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the reports which negates her marriage with the Prophet (peace be upon him). There are no specific narrations which prove that she did marry the Prophet (peace be upon him) and that she was included in the mothers of the believers. We would stick to what RTS itself posted in its website to prove that she was not an Ummul Momineen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> We read in Sahih Muslim:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0633\u064f \u0644\u0627\u064e \u0646\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u062a\u064e\u0651\u062e\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062f\u064d. \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0649\u064e \u0627\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062c\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0649\u064e \u0623\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062f\u064d \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e \u062d\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0632\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The people said: &#8216;We do not know if he (i.e the Prophet) has married her (i.e Safiyyah) or taken her as a concubine.&#8217; They said: &#8216;If he veils her then she is his wife, and if he does not veil her then she is a concubine.&#8217; When he wanted to ride, he veiled her, and she sat on the back of the camel, so they knew that he had married her.<\/p>\n<p>From this narration, we come to know that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) took a woman as his wife, he would veil her. Now RTS has itself mentioned in its website that Qutayla was not veiled.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS has quoted in its website from Usudul Ghaba:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It is also narrated that The Prophet (saw) willed to let her choose, if she wanted she could wear the veil and so she becomes forbidden for the Muslims, or if she wants she can divorce him so she can choose who she wants to marry. She chose to be seperated, so she was given a divorce and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl married her. So Aboo Bakr was informed of this and he said: &#8220;I was urged to (thought of) burning the house over them.&#8221; Umar in response said: &#8220;She is not the mother of believers, he didn&#8217;t enter into her, or make her wear the veil.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Usd ul-Ghaybah.
