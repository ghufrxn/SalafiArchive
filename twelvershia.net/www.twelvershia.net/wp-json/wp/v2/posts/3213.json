However, the Wilayat website provided a shortened version of the narration, while Slave of Ahlubait included it in full.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration goes like this:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Abu huraria said: Umar said to me: o ENEMY OF ALLAH\u00a0and enemy of Islam! you betrayed the money of Allah . He said: I said: I am not an enemy of Allah and not an enemy of Islam but an enemy to whoever is an enemy of them and I did not betray the money of Allah but they were the costs for a camel and spears added together. He said: return it and I said to him the same thing again. He said: he fined me 12 000 . He said: then I stood up for midday prayer and said: O Allah, forgive the commander of the faithful. And what was after that is that he wanted me to work and I didn\u2019t do it. Then he said: not and Yusuf did ask to work and he was better than you. Then I said: verily Yusuf is a prophet son of a prophet son of a prophet son of a prophet and I am son of Umaymah and I fear three and two. He said: don\u2019t you say five? I said: no. He said: what are they? I said: I fear that I speak without knowledge, and issue ruling without knowledge, and that my back gets beaten , and that my representation\/arguments gets insulted .<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Imam Hakim says: sahih on the conditions of Sheikhain but not written <strong><br \/>\n<strong>Dhabi says: sahih on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim<\/strong><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note: The translation of some words above is extremely weak. For example, the term \u201cspears\u201d in the Arabic is <em>siham<\/em>, which means \u201cshares\u201d. However, it seems that the translator made two mistakes. Firstly, he assumed that the term <em>siham<\/em> means \u201carrows\u201d, then wrote \u201cspears\u201d instead of \u201carrows\u201d. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also find the following commentary on the first article:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">well, we are now told that all sahaba are adil, and we should just believe in them, and what they quoted is correct<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">bla bla<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">but was this opinion there in the era of companions? nope<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">why? simple, if it was so, why would umar call abu huraira enemy of allah and his book and a thief? how it proves my stance? simple, if he believe in his adalat, he would not have termed him thief<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration does not serve the purpose of the Shia. First of all, the commentary itself suggests that accusations cannot be made by companions against one another at all since they all considered each other reliable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is false since there was always the possibility that a person that was a companion of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 could apostate. This is why it is the view of Ahl Al-Sunnah that it is only those that die upon Islam that are referred to as companions. In other words, in the eyes of Omar, a person who accompanied the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 can be branded as an enemy of Allah if that person has committed inexcusable acts of treachery. In this case, he was accusing Abu Huraira of stealing from the money of the people of Bahrain, as per the Saheeh narration in Musanaf Abdulrazaq #20659, while he was ruling the area.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, Abu Huraira refutes this allegation by testifying that he acquired this new wealth through the acquisition of shares and through the selling of mounts that were reproducing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">None of the narrations state that Omar ordered to have Abu Huraira\u2019s hand cut off.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reaction of Omar varies in both narrations. The narration above suggests that Omar fined him while the second narration from Abdulrazzaq suggests that Abu Huraira was absolved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since both narrations are authentic, we can reconcile by holding the view that he was first fined, but was then absolved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, both narrations agree that Omar asks Abu Huraira to return to govern. If Omar had not gone back on his view and accusation against Abu Huraira, then he would have not offered him that position, and he would have implemented the Shari\u2019ah rule by cutting his hand off. Instead, he was satisfied with Abu Huraira and recanted his accusation, since it is not befitting for Omar to position an enemy of Allah as a governor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to \u201cAbu huraira: Enemy of Allah &amp; His Book, and a Thief\u201d.
