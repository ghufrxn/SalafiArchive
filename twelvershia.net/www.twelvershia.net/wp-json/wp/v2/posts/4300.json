He is also a student of al-Mirza al-Nuri who believes in the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an as previously explained <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/mirza-al-nuri-tahreef\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the previous article, we saw how al-Nuri -the teacher- insisted on his belief in Tahrif even after another Shia scholar called Shaykh Mahmud tried refuting him in a treatise called &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221;. Al-Nuri went on to author another treatise (in Persian) to refute Shaykh Mahmud, that treatise was not published nor translated but we only know of its contents because al-Nuri&#8217;s student Aqa Buzurg quoted it several times in his encyclopedia &#8220;al-Thari`ah ila Tasanif al-Shi`ah.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this article we will reveal the shocking truth and true beliefs of Aqa Buzurg al-Tihrani the student of al-Nuri al-Tabrasi. What you will read below will make things much clearer so have patience may God preserve you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A- What&#8217;s the position of the student on his teacher who believes in Tahrif?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grand scholar Muhammad al-Husayn al-Husayni says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[His eminence, the lecturer and teacher Aqa Buzurg -his secret be sanctified- is a man of great piety, high morals, discipline, joyful expression and a generous self. He never permitted anyone to dare and attack his teacher, the traditionalist al-Mirza Husayn al-Nuri -son of Shaykh Muhammad Taqi al-Nuri- author of &#8220;Fasl-ul-Khitab&#8221;. He used to defend him in all humbleness and noble character.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: Ma`rifat-ul-Imam 14\/121<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From this text, it seems that al-Tihrani was very fond of his teacher al-Nuri and often defended him. However, what will be his position when faced with the dilemma of his teacher&#8217;s writings concerning the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an? Let us investigate further.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>B- How did the student present the conflict between his teacher and Shaykh Mahmud?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We quote from Aqa Buzurg&#8217;s book the section where he discusses this conflict:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[The first doubt cast by the author of &#8220;Kashf-ul-Irtiyab&#8221; is if the Qur&#8217;anic distortion is proven, then the Jews are justified in saying that both our Books are essentially useless.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our teacher al-Nuri responded to him: This is a verbal fallacy, what I intended by the word \u201cdistortion\u201d in my book is other than the literal meaning of that word. Distortion encompasses alteration, change, addition and subtraction, all of which have taken place in the Jewish books. On the other hand, what I intended by distortion, is specifically general deletion of verses that certainly do not contain rulings. As for additions, all Muslim groups have consensus that nothing was added to what is between the two covers, not even\u00a0 a verse with the shortest eloquent words. Rather, there is an agreement between the people of Qiblah that not a word was added whose location we do not know. So how then can you compare the general deletions we talked about with the apparent meaning of the term? Is this anything other than a verbal fallacy? &#8211; End of the summarized answer to the first doubt.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: al-Thari`ah 10\/221<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first thing we notice is, he seems to be biased towards his teacher. In the sense that he quotes what Shaykh Mahmud says very briefly then gives a lengthy response from his teacher al-Nuri. He makes it so that al-Nuri is the one who has the last word and thus appears to be victorious. Secondly, he refers to the arguments of Shaykh Mahmud in defense of the Qur&#8217;an as &#8220;Shubuhat&#8221; or &#8220;doubts&#8221; which implies that Mahmud&#8217;s stance is incorrect and nothing more than mere doubts whereas the truth lies in the answers of al-Nuri (who insists on Tahrif).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>C- Did the student author a book to refute his deviant teacher?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aqa Buzurg authored a book on the subject and named it &#8220;al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahif `an al-Qur&#8217;an al-Sharif&#8221; which translates to &#8220;The subtle criticism in denying the distortion of the holy Qur&#8217;an.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The title of this book clearly implies that it is a refutation of those deviants who believe the Qur&#8217;an is distorted. However, let us look more into this important book to find out the finer details.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tihrani explains the purpose of his book:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And I have written &#8220;al-Naqd-ul-Latif fi Nafi al-Tahrif&#8221; in support of al-Nuri.
