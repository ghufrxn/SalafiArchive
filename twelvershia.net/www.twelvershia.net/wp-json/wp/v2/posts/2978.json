This shows that they had the ability to do what is even\u00a0greater, and harder than raising the dead.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Al-Wilaya Al-Takweeniya p. 195-196)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NOTE: We do not care how many letters they have, the main point of focus is that the famous Shia scholar al-Haydari announces that\u00a0the 12 Imams can bestow life and take it, they can travel anywhere in the heavens and the earth in the blink of an eye (as one narration he quoted states), they can command and control elements, trees, water, animals, Jinn etc.. The ability to heal the sick, bestow blessings and provide livelihood etc.. Of course he quotes many narrations from Shia books to back up his beliefs and their books are generous when it comes to this sort of thing as we are all aware.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2- Kamal Al-Haydari believes that Ahlulbayt&#8217;s Knowledge encompasses All<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2986 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Scan0008\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0008-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2987 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Scan0009\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0009-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kamal Al-Haydari quotes narrations that suggest that only five types of knowledge are specific to Allah (i.e knowing the future, what is in the womb, when it rains, where one dies, and the time of the judgement day) This is also in Allah&#8217;s book as we all know, such as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs lose [prematurely] or exceed. And everything with Him is by due measure.} [13:8]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Say, &#8220;None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected.&#8221;} [27:65]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Indeed, Allah [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.} [31:34]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, al-Haydari proceeds to refute this because it conflicts with the narrations stating that the 12 Imams know all things. So in order to reconcile,\u00a0he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;And we can reconcile between these narrations with those that have preceded them, in that the prophets and saints &#8211; especially the Prophet and his Ahlulbayt &#8211; knew the unseen<em>\u00a0as well as<\/em>\u00a0these matters (i.e the future, what is in the womb, when it rains, where one dies, and the time of the judgement day), by saying: Knowing the definitiveness of these five matters is\u00a0specific to Allah, as for those other than Him, they even if they knew of these matters through Allah, they cannot be certain, because Allah may perform <em>badaa&#8217; <\/em>(change the future that was predestined).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Ilm Al-Imam p. 329)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NOTE: He is basically saying that Ahlul-Bayt also know the unseen, they also know when it rains, they know what&#8217;s in the wombs etc&#8230; but since Allah can do &#8220;badaa'&#8221; or change the future based on what He sees fit, then only He knows these things for certain whereas what the 12 Imams know may not always be a part of the inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Haydari continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;With this it becomes clear from the narrations that they (as) know the book of Allah from the beginning to the end, and through that they know the matters of the earth and the sky, what existed, what exists, and what will exist until the day of judgement, as well as the news of the heaven and hell-fire, the matters of those that passed and those that will come, and this is in front of their eyes and in their grasps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(ilm Al-Imam p. 117)<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3- Kamal Al-Haydari believes that Ahlulbayt are Superior to all the Prophets (excluding Mohammad) <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2983 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Scan0005\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0005-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2988 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Scan0010\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Scan0010-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It is possible to prove that the Ahlulbayt (as) control the creation through proving that they are better than all the prophets and messengers, except our prophet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Al-Wilaya Al-Takweeniya p. 187)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;In light of what has been mentioned, the Imams of Ahlulbayt are more knowledgeable than all the prophets and messengers with the inclusion of <em>Uloo al-Azm <\/em>(i.e. Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Eisa), except our prophet &#8211; peace be upon him and his family &#8211; .&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Ilm Al-Imam p. 156)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: This last point is not evidence of <em>shirk<\/em>, but it is evidence of <em>kufur<\/em> according to many Sunni scholars. We also decided to share it because modern\u00a0 Shias constantly claim that the Imams are inferior to the prophets, especially the <em>Uloo Al-Azm. (The main reason being is that Allah chose the messengers and prophets and \u00a0preferred them over everyone, so how can\u00a0the Shia claim their 12 saints are greater than the men Allah chose!?)<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>In conclusion<\/strong>, in order to be a Twelver Shia, you must believe according to Shia narrations that: The Imams control everything, The Imams know everything and The Imams are better than everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now the Shia excuse as usual to escape being branded as Mushrikeen is to add the words &#8220;With Allah&#8217;s permission&#8221; at the end of every sentence, so anything that may appear to be major Shirk will be deceptively masked with the addition of those words. For example, if someone says &#8220;Paul knows the unseen and what is in the heavens&#8221; that will be clear Shirk, but just stamp this expression at the end &#8220;With Allah&#8217;s permission&#8221; and you&#8217;ve masked it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you can see from the above, the heretic Shia scholars attribute everything to their Imams in the sense that their Shirk far surpasses that of even some pagans, but they will mask it deceptively. How do we solve this issue? Although this may require an independent research, yet we know from Allah&#8217;s book that the pagans of Quraysh used similar arguments against our Prophet (saw).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, the pagans of Quraysh did believe in Allah, they believe He created everything and He controls all:<\/p>\n<p>{Say, &#8220;Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?&#8221; They will say, &#8220;Allah,&#8221; so say, &#8220;Then will you not fear Him?&#8221;} [10:31]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet (saw) tells them to fear Allah and to stop taking partners besides him, to which they attribute powers, such as saying their stone idols will grant them blessings and make them closer to Allah and they swear oaths by them:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And they worship other than Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, &#8220;These are our intercessors with Allah &#8221; Say, &#8220;Do you inform Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?&#8221; Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.} [10:18]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book, [O Muhammad], in truth. So worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion. &#8211;\u00a0Unquestionably, for Allah is the pure religion. And those who take protectors besides Him [say], &#8220;We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position.&#8221; Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allah does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.} [39:3]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is based on this extremism and ignorance that Shia glorify their leaders and attribute all sorts of powers to them even though on the day of judgement they shall learn that to Allah belong all power and those men had no benefit nor harm for themselves or others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Evidence that Kamal Al-Haydari is a Mushrik &nbsp; Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem, &nbsp; This article is very unlike any of the other articles that we have posted in the past.
