However, the stubbornness of some has led us to writing a follow-up article that explains an aspect that is often overlooked by those that hold the opinion that A\u2019isha was a source of sexual perversion. Below, we shall provide some background for this issue for those that are unaware of the <em>fiqh<\/em> of the matter. This short article is written with the assumption, <strong>for the sake of the argument,<\/strong> that A\u2019isha did believe that this act was permissible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is known from the Qur\u2019an that suckling is only for two year old infants (2:233) and that such a matter leads to prohibition between a wet nurse (a women who breastfeeds infants) and whomever she is suckling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We find in the Qur\u2019an, \u201c<strong>Forbidden<\/strong> to you are your mothers and your daughters and our sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts and brothers\u2019 daughters and sisters\u2019 daughters <strong>and your mothers that have suckled you\u2026<\/strong>\u201d (4:23)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As it is clear from the verse, all of the above women are forbidden upon a man. It other words, if one suckles from a wet nurse, it then become impermissible for him to become married to her. In other words, suckling prohibits sexual activity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, one cannot claim that the view that is attributed to A\u2019isha is proof of sexual perversion. Rather, this view states that it is permissible for a man to get married and have intercourse with a woman EXCEPT IF he suckles from her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Hypothetical Scenarios<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To further illustrate the point, we provide a hypothetical scenario. The scenarios revolve around a man with some religious awareness who cares about Islamic law. Those that don\u2019t wouldn\u2019t even care about suckling laws let alone the laws of marriage before carrying out their desires.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Scenario 1<\/em><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A man wants to get married to a wet nurse. According to the traditional <em>fatwa<\/em> that does not hold that suckling makes a woman forbidden upon a man, the act of <em>suckling<\/em> is <em>haram<\/em>. However, he can get married to her after suckling since this has no affect on his marriage. In other words, he sins, but the marriage is intact.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Scenario 2<\/em><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A man wants to get married to a wet nurse. He decides to take the ruling that is attributed to A\u2019isha. He suckles from her, which in turn prevents him from ever getting married to her. In other words, the suckling is permissible, but any form of sexual activity<strong>, <u>including marriage<\/u><\/strong>, thereon out is prohibited.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the scenarios above in mind, it becomes clear that the opinion that has been attributed to A\u2019isha limits sexual activity more than the traditional opinion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We once again advise readers to refer to our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2013\/07\/20\/response-to-open-challenge-to-the-sons-of-aisha\/\">another article<\/a> which provides strong evidences that A\u2019isha did not hold this opinion. We hope that objective Shias can contemplate upon the basic argument that we have provided instead of emotionally accusing the wife of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 of sexual perversion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Background We have previously covered in another article that there is much doubt regarding whether A\u2019isha permitted the suckling of adults.
