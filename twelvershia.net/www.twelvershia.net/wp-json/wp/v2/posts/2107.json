Throughout shia history, the identity of who is the Mahdi has caused many disputes &amp; controversies among Imami followers. Shias often split and follow different imams after the previous one has passed away. If there were instructions or wills written then how could these disputes arise so often?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those disputes were recorded in detail by a 3rd century shia scholar, al-Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti in his book Firaq al-Shia (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Shia-Sects-Nawbakhti\/dp\/1904063268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow\">link<\/a>). He is one of the foremost respected early Shia scholar. Famous Shia rijali scholar, al-Najashi described him as &#8220;Our Shaikh, the Mutakallim, who surpassed his contemporaries before the year 300H and thereafter&#8221; and he went on to list over 40 of al-Nawbakhti&#8217;s works. al-Tusi also praised al-Nawbakhti as a pious Imami.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us see whom the early shias believe were their true Mahdis:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.
