There is no room for interpretation or reconciliation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So the question would now be,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why would any unbiased individual, who embraced Islam and accepted Allah and his messenger (saw) and believed in his holy book, why would this individual decide to choose the books of one group over the other?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obviously the matter cannot be left to desires and emotions, rather it should be based on evidence and proof,\u00a0since Allah most high criticized those who only follow desires and those who follow guesswork when He (swt) said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Say, &#8220;Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance.&#8221; If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper.} [2:120]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just.} [4:135]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{But those who wrong follow their [own] desires without knowledge. Then who can guide one whom Allah has sent astray? And for them there are no helpers.} [30:29]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for those who follow assumptions and guesswork, Allah has criticized them saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.} [10:66]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{They follow not except assumption and what [their] souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance.} [53:23]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And they have thereof no knowledge. They follow not except assumption, and indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all.} [53:28]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In summary, one should not follow a path just because it appeals to him if it contradicts clear evidence and truth, and one must not base his beliefs on hearsay and baseless assumptions unless he can back it with proof.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To achieve our aim in clarifying which of the two teams\u00a0is closer to truth Insha&#8217;-Allah, we decided to compare the books of both Ahlul-Sunnah and the Twelver Imamiyyah\u00a0to see with objectivity and without sectarian bias, which has the most reliable religious sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since both teams have a couple of books, we decided in order to shorten the research and make it easier for us and the readers, we decided to compare the best book of each group, for Ahlul-Sunnah it is al-Sahih al-Jami` of al-Imam al-Bukhari and as for the Twelver Imamis it is their big book al-Kafi written by al-Shaykh al-Kulayni.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below will be various researches and comparisons, not in any specific order, between both books, to see which is the better and more reliable source.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NOTES:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Research will be updated regularly Insha&#8217;-Allah with more data and additional information, check the time\u00a0of update next to each piece.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Research will be conducted from the point of view of an objective individual, neither Sunni nor Shia, based on what any convert would understand from the book of Allah (swt).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the name of Allah we begin,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/06\/02\/prophetic-narrations-numbers-and-authenticity\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">1-Availability of prophetic narrations, orders, sayings and instructions.<\/a>\u00a0(6\/2\/2014)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"The Teachers: Their reliability and variety\" href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/06\/04\/the-teachers-their-reliability-and-variety\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">2-The Teachers: Their reliability and variety.<\/a> (6\/5\/2014)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><a title=\"Oral transmission: The declaration of hearing from the scholars\" href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/07\/20\/oral-transmission-the-declaration-of-hearing-from-the-scholars\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">3-<\/span><\/a><a style=\"color: #727272;\" href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/07\/20\/oral-transmission-the-declaration-of-hearing-from-the-scholars\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Oral transmission: The declaration of hearing from the scholars<\/span><\/a>. <\/span>(7\/20\/2014)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Understanding &amp;
