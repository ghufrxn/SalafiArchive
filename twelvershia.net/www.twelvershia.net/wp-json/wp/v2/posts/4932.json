One of these conditions is that the\nImamate is exclusive to the progeny of Al-\u1e24usayn, which led to the elimination\nof Mo\u1e25ammad bin Al-\u1e24anafiyyah, the progeny of Al-\u1e24assan, and other Hashimites\nfrom the station of Imam. It was also quite useful for putting an end to those\nirritating lesser known non-Hashimites like `Abdull\u0101h bin `Amr bin \u1e24arb\nAl-Kind\u012b,<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a>\nwho sought after the Imamate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by the middle of the second century, pressure by other Shia sects increased, which may have looked something similar to what has been attributed to `Abdull\u0101h bin Al-\u1e24asan: \u201cWhy would it be in the progeny of Al-\u1e24usayn when both are the leaders of the youth of paradise and are equal in merit, except for that Al-\u1e24assan precedes Al-\u1e24usayn in age, and the Imamate is supposed to be assigned to he who is superior?\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the concept of the superiority of Al-\u1e24assan over Al-\u1e24usayn\nmay seem foreign to most Shias today, this was the view of the early Shias as\nrecorded by Al-Kar\u0101jik\u012b<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a>\nand is also supported by a report by that was attributed to Ja\u2019far Al-\u1e62\u0101diq.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to these circumstances, those that held the belief that the Imamate is restricted to the progeny of Al-\u1e24usayn required a justification for themselves and for their opponents. The height of this perhaps occurred in the second century during the times of Al-B\u0101qir and Al-\u1e62\u0101diq. This is obvious when realizing that Ibn B\u0101bawayh Al-Qumm\u012b, in his `Ilal Al-Shar\u0101`i`i, has a full chapter, with twelve narrations, entitled: The reason as to why the Imamate is in the progeny of Al-\u1e24usayn and not the progeny of Al-\u1e24assan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first nine reports in this key chapter offer nothing\nmore than an affirmation of the criterion. The last three narrations provide\nmore direct answers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narration #10 states, \u201cAllah is not asked about His actions.\u201d This would be sufficient to believers in the constriction, but it was most likely not satisfying to opponents. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narration #11 provides a very spiritualistic interpretation\nthat involves Mo\u1e25ammad (peace be upon him) and Ali being created as a pillar of\nlight, which split from within Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, into `Abdull\u0101h and Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib,\nthen to \u0100mina bint Wahb and F\u0101\u1e6dima bint Asad. Then \u0100mina gave birth to the Prophet\n(peace be upon him) and F\u0101\u1e6dima gave birth to `Al\u012b. Ultimately, the report ends\nwith the explanation that Al-\u1e24assan came from the light of `Al\u012b and Al-\u1e24usayn\ncame from the light of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which led to the\nImamate being transferred within the progeny of Al-\u1e24usayn alone. The report\ncomes through the path of Ibn `Ulayya, from\nAslam bin Maysara Al-`Ijl\u012b, from Anas bin M\u0101lik, from Mu`a\u1e0f bin Jabal. This\nreport does not go through Ahlulbayt, but through Sunni narrators, apparently\nin order to provide it more legitimacy. They could argue that Shias themselves\nshould not dispute the matter of the exclusivity for even the Sunnis are aware\nof this matter and narrate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narration #12 includes\na polemical response instead of an answer where Al-Rab\u012b\u2019 bin `Abdill\u0101h argues\nthat the line of prophets came through the path of H\u0101r\u016bn instead of M\u016bs\u0101 even\nthough M\u016bs\u0101 was superior to H\u0101r\u016bn. Al-\u1e62\u0101diq praises Al-Rab\u012b\u2019 for his sound\nreasoning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, none of the\nreports in the chapter provide a clear-cut answer, with the exception of\nnarration #11, which is a clear fabrication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>A Clear\nJustification<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely enough,\nthere is one report that Ibn B\u0101bawayh did not include in his chapter, but can\nbe found in early sources. Not surprisingly, the report comes in forms that are\nquite controversial and contradict what is seen as established Shia ideologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report, which\ncomes in the form of a dispute between Zayn Al-`\u0100bid\u012bn and his uncle Mo\u1e25ammad\nbin Al-\u1e24anafiyyah on which of them is supposed to be the Imam. Their dispute is\nsettled by the black stone which testified that Zayn Al-`\u0100bid\u012bn is the true\nsuccessor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narration can be\nfound in Ba\u1e63\u0101`ir Al-Daraj\u0101t,<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a>\nMukhta\u1e63ar Ba\u1e63\u0101`ir Al-Daraj\u0101t,<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a>\nAl-K\u0101f\u012b,<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]<\/a>\nAl-Im\u0101ma wal Al-Tab\u1e63ira,<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]<\/a>\nand Dal\u0101`il Al-Im\u0101ma.<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]<\/a>\nDuring the discussion, Zayn Al-`\u0100bid\u012bn states that \u201cYou should not dispute this\nmatter, for I fear for you that your life may be shortened and the deterioration\nof your condition.
