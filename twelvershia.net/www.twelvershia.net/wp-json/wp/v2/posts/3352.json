Some suggested that it is to be taken from all forms of income, while other narrations suggest that it is specifically for <em>ghanima<\/em>. Shia scholars did not reconcile these reports by saying that <em>ghanima<\/em> is referring to income as well, instead, they provided alternative explanations.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Tusi, when commenting on a narration in Al-Istibsaar 2\/392 said, \u201cThe meaning is that there is there is no <em>khums<\/em> except with it comes to <em>ghana\u2019im <\/em>only, which is the apparent meaning from the Qur\u2019an.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Sunni View<\/u><\/strong><strong><u> of Khums<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Ahlul Sunnah view <strong><em>khums<\/em><\/strong> payable on the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>War booty (<strong><em>ghanimah<\/em><\/strong>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buried treasure (<strong><em>rikaaz<\/em><\/strong>).

Therefore, to them, it becomes an income tax.<\/p>\n<p>Rizvi states that \u201cIncome means whatever you earn from business, wage or salary, dividend income, or by other means of possession recognized by the shari`ah. Is khums also wajib on <strong>gift, prize, legacy, charity, zakat and khums?<\/strong> According to most present mujtahids, it is precautionarily wajib to pay khums from such items also.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He explains, \u201cFor example, Ahmad&#8217;s annual expenditure is $ 10,000. He inherits $ 10,000 from his father, and he also earns $ 20,000 during that year. He has the option of either using the $ 10,000 inherited money for his expenditure and pay the khums from the entire $ 20,000 which he earned that year; or deducting the $ 10,000 for his annual expenditure from his income, and pay khums from the remaining $ 10,000 which is the surplus of the income. The $ 10,000 dollars which Ahmad inherited is not liable for khums.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shias also hold the belief that the amount is deductible from household expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Rizvi clarifies, \u201cFor example, if a person&#8217;s annual income is $ 20,000 and his needs and status require him to spend $ 10,000 on his annual household expenses, but he exceed his limit and spends $ 15,000 &#8212; then he must pay the khums on everything over $ 10,000.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Sayyid Rizvi\u2019s Arguments for Khums during the Times of the Prophet<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Rizvi provides three pieces of evidence that historically \u201cgains\u201d referred to <em>khums<\/em> instead of the spoils of war. He provides a narration from Saheeh Al-Bukhari about Bani Abdul Qais, a narration from Al-Amwal by Al-Qasim bin Salaam about the Khums of Yemen, and an order to Amr bin Hazm to collect it from Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>All three of these appear in the Arabic text along with the term <em>ghanima<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Shi\u2019ee Narrations about Khums<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The main evidence that the Shi\u2019a use for the implementation of <strong><em>khums<\/em><\/strong> as a tax are their books of hadith. To be blunt \u2013 Shia <strong><em>ahadith<\/em><\/strong> are not a <strong><em>hujjah<\/em><\/strong> (proof) upon Ahlul Sunnah, and we reject them completely as fabrications.<\/p>\n<p>However, there was one <u>authentic<\/u> narration that caught our eye that we choose to present to the Shia reader.<\/p>\n<p>Narrated al-Hassan bin Mahbub, from Abdullah bin Sinaan who said: \u201cI heard Abu Abdullah (peace be upon him) say &#8211; \u201cKhums is only on <em>ghanaa\u2019im<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Man La Yahduruhu Al Faqih by Al-Saduq 2\/273<\/p>\n<p>Al-Istibsaar by Al-Tusi 2\/392<\/p>\n<p>In the above authentic narration &#8211; Ja\u2019far as-Sadiq states that it is only payable on spoils of war. He offers no qualifications or conditions. The path from Al-Saduq and Al-Tusi to Al-Hassan bin Mahbub is authentic according to major hadith scholars like Al-Khoei. See Al-Mufeed min Mu\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadeeth (p. 152).<\/p>\n<p>This narration fits in with the apparent meaning provided in the Qur\u2019an as Al-Tusi has stated above. It also fits in with the Arabic language and the practices of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; .<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Shias may argue that there are other hadiths that contradict this hadith and that there are many in number, which means that <em>khums<\/em> does apply to income taxes and the like. In other words, they may argue that the Qur\u2019an may not contain the Shia understanding of <em>khums, <\/em>and yet, that understanding can be found in Shia hadiths. However, Shias pride themselves on holding steadfast onto the Qur\u2019an, for they claim to toss against the wall whatever conflicts with the Qur\u2019an. We have demonstrated clearly, in this scenario, that the Qur\u2019an only speaks of\u00a0it in regards to spoils of war, and by accepting narrations against this understanding is in reality going against the Qur\u2019an and favoring Shia hadiths that have been falsely attributed to Ahlulbayt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>The Original Khums Scam<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first scam occurred in the third century during the time of the Shia Imam Al-Jawad. The collector of his Khums in Qum, Salih bin Mohammad bin Sahl, confessed to stealing ten thousand dinars, instead of giving it to the Imam.<\/p>\n<p>A dinar of gold back then is equivalent to 4.24 grams of gold today. A gram of gold is worth $43 according to online markets. So, the ten thousand dinars spent by Salih bin Mohammad bin Sahl is the equivalent of $1,823,200 today.<\/p>\n<p>The narration can be found in Al-Kafi 1\/352 and it is an authentic narration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Modern Day Khums Scams<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/isa-qassim\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3353 size-thumbnail alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Isa-Qassim-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"khums\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Isa-Qassim-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Isa-Qassim-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Isa-Qassim-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Isa-Qassim-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>&#8211; Ayatollah <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-bahrain-cleric-idUSKCN0ZW11U\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Isa Qassim<\/a>, according to Reuters, was accused of money laundering, when $10 million was found in his bank account.
