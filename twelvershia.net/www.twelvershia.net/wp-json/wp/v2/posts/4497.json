A careful analysis of early Twelver biographical sources, however, is sufficient to dispel this inaccurate appeal often made by Shi\u2019i apologists and polemicists alike, and demonstrate that Shi\u2019ite scholarship at various points in history did, in fact, consider various Twelver hadith collections \u201cSahih\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2>Authentic Works<\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Tafsir of \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim Al-Qommi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2018Ali b. Ibrahim Al-Qommi, author of one of the most renowned Twelver exegeses of the Quran, is quoted saying, in the introduction to his tafsir: \u201cAnd we shall transmit what has reached us from our teachers and reliable transmitters regarding those whom Allah has made their obedience obligatory\u2026.\u201d (Al-Qommi 1:4 )<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Appealing to this statement of Al-Qommi, key Shi\u2019i scholars held the position that the default status of any hadith in his book is that it is authentic, unless proven otherwise.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grand Ayatollah, Al-Khoei, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this statement is a clear indication that he [Al-Qommi] only transmits from reliable transmitters in this book. In fact, the author of <em>Al-Wasa\u2019il<\/em>, concluded \u2013 in the 6<sup>th <\/sup><em>fa\u2019ida <\/em>mentioned in his book that the book is <u>Sahih<\/u>, after listing the testimony of many of our scholars regarding the validity of the mentioned books, their tawatur, their authenticity to their authors, and their authenticity to <em>Ahlulbait<\/em> \u2013 that any [transmitter] cited in reports of \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim back to one of the infallibles is reliable. He [author of Al-Wasa\u2019il] said: \u201cAnd \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim attested to the authenticity of the hadiths in his Tafsir, and that they are transmitted through reliable transmitters to the Imams (as).\u201d (Al-Khoei 1:49)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei then comments saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;His conclusion is valid, for \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim intended, in what he had said, to establish the authenticity of his Tafsir and that its reports are established and they were actually relayed from the infallibles.&#8221; (Al-Khoei 1:49)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei proceeds to elaborate on this statement, concluding that any report of \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim Al-Qommi in his Tafsir, ascribed to the infallibles and transmitted through uncriticized Shi\u2019ite transmitters is authentic by default.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shi\u2019ite scholar, Muhammad Amin Al-Astarabadi, described the book saying: \u201cIt is a Sahih tafsir that can be relied upon in the Shariah because it is all taken from the infallibles.\u201d (Al-Astarabadi 516)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many similar quotes exist; however, this shall be sufficient to demonstrate how major Shi\u2019ite scholars deemed the book authentic.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Book of Al-Hasan b. \u2018Ali b. Al-No\u2019man<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Najashi said: &#8220;He was a reliable <em>thabt<\/em>.

He has books that are authentic in hadith, such as: Kitab Al-Tawhid, Al-Mu\u2019min wal-Muslim, Al-Maqt wal-Tawbikh, Al-Imamah, Al-Nawadir, Al-Mazar, Al-Mut\u2019ah.&#8221; (Al-Khoei 7:24)<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Books of Yunus b. \u2018Abdurrahman <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Babuyah said: &#8220;I heard Ibn Al-Walid say: &#8216;The books of Yunus b. \u2018Abdurrahman that are transmitted with reports are all authentic books that can be relied upon, except what is exclusively transmitted from Muhammad b. \u2018Isa b. \u2018Ubayd, from Yunus and not corroborated by anyone else; that cannot be relied nor acted upon.&#8217;\u201d (Al-Khoei 21:211)<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Book of Sadaqah b. Bundar<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Najashi said: &#8220;He was a righteous reliable transmitter. He had a book known as <em>Al-Tajammul wal-Muru\u2019ah<\/em>. It is pleasant and authentic in hadith.\u201d (Al-Khoei 10:110)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Different Paradigm: The Akhbaris<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When addressing the issue of authenticity of Shi\u2019ite hadith collections, one cannot bypass the Akhbari school. Though most Shias today do not ascribe to this school, many of their major scholars from the Twelver tradition, such as Al-Majlisi, Al-Hurr Al-\u2018Ameli, Yusuf Al-Bahrani, Ne\u2019matullah Al-Jaza\u2019eri and many others, ascribed to the Akhbari school.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is noteworthy about the Akhbari school is that it held the position that ALL of the contents of the four hadith books of the Shia are authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei, in the introduction to <em>Mo\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith<\/em>, acknowledges the existence of this position among Shi\u2019ite scholarship, even though he vehemently disagrees with it. He said: \u201cA group of the muhaddithin held the position that all of the reports in the four books are relayed from the Imams with certainty.\u201d (Al-Khoei 1:22)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Hurr Al-\u2018Ameli, for example, in <em>Wasa\u2019il Al-Shia<\/em>, mentioned twelve arguments why he believed that all of the four books were authentic. (Al-Fadli 211)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In <em>Mir\u2019at Al-\u2018Uqul<\/em>, Al-Majlisi stated that the Akhbaris cited Al-Kulayni\u2019s preface to <em>Al-Kafi<\/em> to argue that the entire book was authentic (Al-Majlisi 1:21) . He then says: \u201cIn conclusion, the truth regarding this matter, in my opinion, is that the existence of a hadith in such relied upon collections is indicative of the permissibility to act upon it.\u201d (Al-Majlisi 1:22)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many similar sentiments are reported from Akhbari scholars, and it is important that they are not sidelined amidst the discussion on the attitude Twelver scholarship has had towards its hadith collections. The Akhbari school spans some of the most renowned scholars from the Shi\u2019ite tradition and various figures from the school explicitly stated that the classical Twelver canon (the four books) was authentic. Thus, it is inaccurate to claim that Shi\u2019ite Islam, across history, has never deemed a book wholly authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, Shi\u2019ite polemicists often demonstrate their ignorance when claiming that there are no \u201cSahih\u201d hadith books within Shi\u2019i Islam. Rather, there were several works that were labeled \u201cSahih\u201d by Shi\u2019ite scholarship at various points in history. Similarly, one cannot overlook Akhbari scholarship and their position on the matter, which preposterously claims that ALL of the four books are authentic. Either way, the claim that Shia Islam has never had Sahih hadith collections is a fallacious claim, and it\u2019s about time that this cop-out is abandoned and replaced with actual arguments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Allah is the best of witnesses,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Al-\u2018Abbas Al-Shami<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Astarabadi, Muhammad Amin.
