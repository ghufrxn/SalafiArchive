Indeed, the fact that `Uthman compiled the Qur&#8217;an into book form has turned many Shia away from it due to their hatred of Umayyads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to learn more about his belief, we turn towards a more specialized book. A treatise by the name of &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; written by al-`Amili.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you&#8217;re going to find it odd, that a person who believes in Tahrif would have a book aiming to prove the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an. The title of the book &#8220;Tawatur al-Qur&#8217;an&#8221; implies that the author wouldn&#8217;t be from those who believe in Tahrif, nonetheless let&#8217;s read what the researcher of the book al-Sayyid Muhammad Hadi Karami says in the introduction pg.21 while discussing the contents of the book:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Then the Shaykh (i.e al-`Amili) mentioned that the presence of deletion (in the Qur&#8217;an) does not oppose the fact that what&#8217;s present from it (today) is mass transmitted nor does believing in this\u00a0(i.e deletion) cause harm. What opposes the mass transmission (of the Qur&#8217;an) is the presence of additions and distortions.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There you have it folks! According to the researcher&#8217;s summary, al-`Amili\u00a0proves that the Qur&#8217;an is mass transmitted even though the Companions removed verses of `Ali&#8217;s merits. The deletion of verses does not constitute any harm when it comes to Tawatur, only additions are problematic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, when al-`Amili is talking about Tawatur, he isn&#8217;t talking about the mass transmission of the Qur&#8217;an as it was revealed to prophet Muhammad (saw). Since as you know he believes verses are missing, he&#8217;s mainly talking about the mass transmission of\u00a0`Uthman&#8217;s official Qur&#8217;an\u00a0after those verses were dropped and after the official version was spread in the lands.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researcher makes sure to highlight this point on the same page:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[It&#8217;s no secret, that the debate revolves around the mass transmission of this Qur&#8217;an from the Prophet (saw) not its mass transmission from those who had later collected it.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s move to al-`Amili&#8217;s own words and see if the researcher got it right, he says on pg.31:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Mixing both additions and deletion when discussing this matter is not good. Because the deletions, in case they did actually occur, do not oppose the mass transmission of what is present today. We are only discussing the amount that is found in the Book now, is it mass transmitted or not? Does it contain additions, distortions and alterations or not? No doubt it is mass transmitted today.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notice the author refuses to discuss deletions, he says they aren&#8217;t harmful and the discussion is only concerning the verses that survived today in the Qur&#8217;an, have they reached us through Tawatur or not? He says if they did, then it is evidence that no additions or\u00a0distortions took place in our Qur&#8217;an, yet he never mentions deletions as if it isn&#8217;t a big deal if our Qur&#8217;an lost verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-`Amili then quotes al-Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Damad on pg.40, al-Damad\u00a0quotes the verse about Allah promising to protect the revelation and comments that it is an evidence against those who believe the Qur&#8217;an contains additions or that parts may be corrupted and replaced with others, also its order and arrangement. However, when he reaches the part about &#8220;deletion&#8221; Damad says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Regarding verses being left behind, or being dropped after they were revealed, the majority of our companions allow this and a few of the commoners as well. The majority of the mainstream (Muslims) prohibit this completely although the narrations in our books and theirs are plentiful in stating that these deletion did in fact take place generally.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0650Al-`Amili then writes that the Muslims had unquestionably transmitted the Qur&#8217;an and that even if the Muslims had certain motivations to remove or hide certain verses, then this is restricted to a small portion of the Qur&#8217;an not all of it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-`Amili then quotes two narrations about how `Ali collected the full Qur&#8217;an and how the Companions rejected it. Then\u00a0`Umar began collecting the Qur&#8217;an by bringing at least two witnesses for every verse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-`Amili comments on the narrations pg.68:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I say: I\u00a0learned from these two narrations and their likes, that they (as) ruled\u00a0that this Qur&#8217;an is truthful, all of it is correct without any additions or distortion. However, what is understood from the two reports regarding the deletion, is possibly concerning the interpretation that descended alongside the revelation and there&#8217;s quite a few clues for this, Or it could be that it&#8217;s concerning the revelation that isn&#8217;t part of the Qur&#8217;an as al-Saduq previously stated. It is also possible that it refers to abrogation among other possibilities. What is apparent from the second report is that the deletion was related to what contained the scandals of those folks including the textual appointment of the Imams. The presence of those texts would have exposed their disobedience and so no doubt nothing more than these kinds of texts were dropped. This however does not negate the mass transmission of what was dropped (from verses) let alone what is still present. The reason that they (i.e Companions) requested two witnesses (for each verse) instead of one, was simply a ruse and a scheme on their part, due to the prevalence of Taqiyyah and the number of hypocrites who support them (i.e supported Abu Bakr and `Umar) as well as the small number of their opponents who were siding\u00a0with the chief of believers (as). It&#8217;s sufficient for you to know that they were followed by countless thousands\u00a0whereas the chief of believers (as) only had the support of four people, this makes things clear.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the above he lists various possibilities for what was dropped and that it might be interpretation or revelation. Then he says that the second narration hints that certain verses were indeed dropped and they would have exposed Abu Bakr and `Umar if they remained. This is why Abu Bakr and\u00a0`Umar, when collecting the Qur&#8217;an, placed a condition that any verse that must be written needs two witnesses. By doing so, they got rid of all verses related to the Imam&#8217;s appointment as he and his supporters couldn&#8217;t speak since they were in Taqiyyah, thus\u00a0those verses were not written due to the absence of witnesses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-`Amili states that the Qur&#8217;an was mass transmitted during the time of the Prophet (saw) and that the Companions had all\u00a0verses written, however he doesn&#8217;t mean that this proves that no verses were lost later, because he states right after that this was the case until `Uthman burned them as if to hint that it was mass transmitted until `Uthman destroyed the evidence by force.
