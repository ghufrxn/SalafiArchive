Of course, this was not their intention. Their intention was to prove that Mu\u2019awiyah has no positive merits, but in the process did Ahl Al-Sunnah a great service by shining light on their objectivity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA quoted that major scholars including Ishaaq bin Rahawaih, Al-Nasa\u2019ee, and Ibn Al-Jawzi all rejected that Mu\u2019awiyah has any positive merits in the prophetic tradition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA also quoted the opinion of Imam Ahmad that the enemies of `Ali fabricated narrations in praise of Mu\u2019awiyah. We say there&#8217;s ten tons of Hadiths fabricated in praise of `Ali by his own so called supporters, none of this matters though.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These statements, if one truly considers their weight, will realize that the criticisms towards the Hadith sciences, the scholars, and the narrators, are completely baseless. There is no shred of doubt that the scholars of Ahl Al-Sunnah want to find narrations in praise of Mu\u2019awiyah. If the Hadith sciences were as fragile as the Orientalists want us to believe, then we would have found tons of authentic narrations in praise of Mu\u2019awiyah. However, it is due to the rigidity of the sciences, that these narrations could not survive in the eyes of the objective Sunni scholars, for the vast majority of those Hadiths were immediately broken down as blunt fabrications of extreme Nawasib.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This not only demonstrates the objectivity of those scholars, but also demonstrates that they were God-fearing individuals. What is to prevent from authenticating such reports? What is to prevent them from strengthening those fabricators? What is to prevent them from creating narrations in order to praise Mu\u2019awiyah? It was the objective system and the fear of Allah that prevented these things. Truly, Allah has guarded His Deen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #003300;\"><strong>\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0646\u064e\u0632\u0651\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0651\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0644\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0638\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #003300;\"><strong>{We have sent down the remembrance and we shall surely guard it.}<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Dhikr in the verse according to many scholars of Tafseer includes both the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is actually a Hadith in praise of Mu`awiyah which is authentic <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/03\/17\/response-to-the-only-hadeeth-in-glory-of-muawiah-in-sihah-e-sitta\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cAny Sahih Hadeeth about Glory of Mawia?\u201d The article can be found here.
