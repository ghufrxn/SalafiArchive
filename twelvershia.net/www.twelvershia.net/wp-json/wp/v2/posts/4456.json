Even though he does not shy away from showing his Sh\u012ba tendencies by cursing companions like Uthm\u0101n, it seems as though he knew his boundaries and avoided crossing them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We find similar scenarios today. A scholar will criticize the caliphs, declare that Mu\u2019awiyah is out of Islam, show extreme love for Ahlulbayt, but would claim to be a Sunn\u012b. These are all major red flags. However, there are other certain views, if suppressed, could allow a closet Shia to win the hearts of Sunn\u012bs. These include, calling to the Imamate of the Twelve Imams, or the resurrection of the Im\u0101ms, or the distortion of the Qur\u2019an, among other exclusive Sh\u012ba views. Views like these would only expose one as a <em>taqiyyah <\/em>practitioner.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Early Sunni View of `Abb\u0101d<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The general view of `Abb\u0101d was a positive one.

This is quite a shock to those studying the character of `Abb\u0101d in the books of both sects, for how is it possible that both sects contradict one another by attributing a narrator to the other sect instead of embracing him as their own?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A solution to this dilemma can be found in Al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b\u2019s biography of `Abb\u0101d Ab\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd Al-`U\u1e63fur\u012b. He says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;`Abb\u0101d Ab\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd Al-`U\u1e63fur\u012b is a Kufan.

Al-U\u1e63fur\u012b is a job title for one who dyes clothes. Ab\u016b Sam\u012bna gave him this title in order to hide his identity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b may have been aware of this and gave a separate biogra<span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">phy for\u00a0`Abb\u0101d Al-`U<\/span>\u1e63fur\u012b, suggesting that there were two `Abb\u0101ds and not just one. This may have been due to his ignorance of the reality of `Abb\u0101d, or because he wanted to keep the charade on-going.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the greatest evidence that `Abb\u0101d is actually a full-fledged Twelver is the <em>asl<\/em> that he narrates, which is what we\u2019ll be exploring further.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It should be noted that `Abb\u0101d&#8217;s <em>asl<\/em> is the most important <em>asl<\/em> that we have access to today. It is the only <em>asl <\/em>that speaks about the appointment of the Twelve Im\u0101ms. The <em>usool, <\/em>according to Sh\u012bas, are the four-hundred works that were written by the companions of the Im\u0101ms. Sh\u012bas often argue that their Four Books are built upon the narrations of these four-hundred <em>usool<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Was `Abb\u0101d bin Ya\u2019qoub really `Abb\u0101d Al-U\u1e63fur\u012b?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no reason to assume that they are not one and the same, apart from the contradiction above about his sectarian leanings, for both were named `Abb\u0101d, were called Ab\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd, were from Kufa, lived in the same era, and shared the same teachers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Abb\u0101d\u2019s <em>asl<\/em>, only includes nineteen narrations, through seven teachers. Four of those teachers are also teachers of `Abb\u0101d bin Ya\u2019q\u016bb in Sunn\u012b books.

For instance, he narrates through the path of Sulaym\u0101n bin Qarm that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 and `Al\u012b will be resurrected together.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]<\/a> He also narrates from `Al\u012b bin `\u0100bis\u00a0 that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 gave F\u0101\u1e6dima Fadak while he was alive.<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]<\/a> He also reports from the path of Mo\u1e25ammad bin Salama that `Al\u012b was told by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 that his nation would betray him.<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, due to the weakness of each of those narrators that he narrates through, `Abb\u0101d would often get a free pass, and those narrators would receive the blame instead.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was on one occasion that `Abb\u0101d was called out. He narrates from Shar\u012bk from \u2018\u0100sim from Zir from Ibn Mas`\u016bd from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 that he said, \u201cIf you see Mu\u2019awiyah on my pulpit, then kill him.\u201d Ibn \u1e24ibb\u0101n accuses `Abb\u0101d for fabricating this report.<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-D\u0101raqu\u1e6dn\u012b, surprisingly, comes to the rescue of `Abb\u0101d, in his commentary of Al-Majr\u016bh\u012bn by claiming that `Abb\u0101d never narrated this hadith from Shar\u012bk, but rather, narrated it from Al-\u1e24akam bin \u1e92uhayr, and that the inclusion of Shar\u012bk in the chain is a mistake.<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]<\/a> Al-\u1e24akam was a known forger of reports.<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\">[19]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In short, it seems that `Abb\u0101d bin Ya\u2019q\u016bb may have indeed been truthful in Sunn\u012b works. He would serve his sectarian beliefs by reporting pro-Sh\u012ba fabrications. However, since he is not the origin of these fabrications, the blame would fall on others in the chain. It also seems as though `Abb\u0101d was careful with what he narrated. He would not narrate to Sunn\u012b audiences what he deemed to support his Twelver ideology.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Extreme Narrations of `Abb\u0101d in Sh\u012ba Books<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narrations of `Abb\u0101d bin Ya\u2019q\u016bb in his <em>asl<\/em> show another side in the character of `Abb\u0101d.

He said, \u2018The Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him and his household \u2013 exiled him to Dahlak, which is a part of Abyssinian land.\u2019 He said, \u2018When Ab\u016b Bakr came to power, he was spoken to about him, and he refused to let him back.\u2019 He said, \u2018When Omar came to power, he was spoken to about him, and he said, \u2018He was exiled by the Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him and his household \u2013 and Ab\u016b Bakr, how could I allow him back?\u2019 So he refused. When `Uthm\u0101n came to power, he said, `Omar and an old Muslim man.\u2019 He said, \u2018So he let him in and gave him a hundred thousand dirhams from the treasury of the Muslims.\u2019\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\">[25]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The same report can be found in Al-\u1e6cabar\u0101n\u012b\u2019s Al-Kab\u012br in which \u1e24u\u1e0fayfa said, \u201cWhen the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 passed away and Ab\u016b Bakr succeeded him, he was spoken to about Al-\u1e24akam bin Al-`\u0100s.
