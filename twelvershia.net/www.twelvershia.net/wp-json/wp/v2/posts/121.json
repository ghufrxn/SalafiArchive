Say: They are a hurt and a pollution: <b>So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by Allah<\/b>. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean (2.22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS concludes that this verse implies that husbands cannot approach their wives in any manner when during menses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, RTS quotes narrations in which A\u2019isha narrates that the Prophet (pbuh) used to fondle her during menses while he ordered her to wear an izar (clothing that is wrapped around the legs).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS quotes:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> We read in Saheeh Bukhari Volume 1, Book 6, Number 298: Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The Prophet and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in Itikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Saheeh Bukhari\u00a0Volume 1, Book 6, Number 299:\u00a0Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad:\u00a0(on the authority of his father) &#8216;Aisha said: &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to fondle anyone of us during her periods (menses), he used to order her to put on an Izar and start fondling her.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;None of you could control his sexual desires as the Prophet could.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS comments:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The Prophet (saw) has eight other wives to fulfil his needs, so why was he seeking to cleave to an unclean Aisha (la)? \u00a0Is it right that a wife notifies this sordid, filthy detail to others, and worse still a man? \u00a0What would the Sirah of the Prophet (saw) remain nebulous had it not been for this filthy narration?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no doubt in the minds of Muslims that Islam does not permit filthy acts. In other words, that which may be seen as filthy, in the eyes of a certain individual, may not be so in the eyes of another. In other words, determining what is filthy and what isn\u2019t, in many cases, is a subjective matter. However, there is no subjectivity in this specific matter since Islam allows for one to fondle his wife during menses, with the specific condition that he may not approach her vagina.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only is this ruling understood from the narration above that RTS quotes, but it is also the position of Twelver Shias.

He responded: She would wrap an izar around her legs, and would reveal her belly, and whatever is above that, is permissible.
