All will be exposed in our article for all to see.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The article has been divided into the following categories:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Personal Views Regarding the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Admission that some Shias Believed in <em>Tahreef<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Accusations against Ahlulsunnah Regarding <em>Tahreef<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Criticisms towards the Sunni Stance of the Compilation of the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Additional Important Points Raised by Al-Khoei<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before even getting to the refutations, we present the readers with the author\u2019s personal views regarding the Qur\u2019an:<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Personal Views Regarding the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1- Al-Khoei believes that the &#8216;Shia infallible&#8217; Imams taught <em>tahreef <\/em>Al-Qur\u2019an!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The examples provided by Al-Khoei to demonstrate his point that Sunnis believe in <em>tahreef<\/em> are extremely problematic, namely the narration which\u00a0states that there is a verse that speaks of the stoning of adulterers. Al-Khoei (p. 9) comments that <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>\u201cthere is nothing in the Qur\u2019an today which indicates the law of stoning the adulterers. And if the reports are to be considered true, then it follows that an ayah has definitely disappeared from the Qur\u2019an.\u201d<\/em><\/span> However, the narration itself can be found in Shia source Al-Kafi as well. Al-Kulayni 7\/1714 narrates that Abu Abdullah (as) said: Stoning is in the Qur\u2019an, it is Allah&#8217;s saying: \u201cIf the old man and woman fornicate, then stone them, for they have fulfilled their desire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Majlisi authenticates the narration in <em>Mir\u2019aat Al-Uqool<\/em> 23\/268. He also says: <em>This is one of the verses that was abrogated in recitation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei, of course, is aware of this narration in Shia books, which is why he did not comment on it in his Bayan. However, he did comment on this issue elsewhere. He states in the book\u00a0<em>Mabani Takmilat Al-Minhaj<\/em> 1\/195-196 from the narration of Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq that this is indeed authentic and that Al-Sadiq taught <em>naskh(Abrogation)\u00a0<\/em>out of <em>taqiyyah!<\/em>\u00a0Ayatullah Al-Milani in his Al-Tahqeeq fi Nafi Al-Tahreef (p. 164) confirms Al-Khoei\u2019s view and does not comment on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be aware that <em>naskh<\/em> according to Al-Khoei is <em>tahreef<\/em>. Therefore, Al-Khoei is saying that the Imams taught <em>tahreef, <\/em>but did this out of <em>taqiyyah<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, the &#8216;Shia infallible&#8217; Imams taught the people <em>kufur<\/em>, which is <em>tahreef <\/em>of the book of Allah!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2- Al-Khoei Believes that the Qu\u2019ran cannot be used for Religious Rulings!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This chapter was never translated by the Shia website but can be found in the original work on page 164. (Al-A\u2019alami Publishing House, Third Edition: 1974)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a lengthy chapter discussing the various recitations of the Qur\u2019an, Al-Khoei argues that none of them are reliable. This is extremely problematic since this refers to all the diacritical marks found in the Qur\u2019an and all that is left is the shapes of the letters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He explains:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>\u201cIn truth, the recitations hold no evidence and cannot be used for the extraction of religious rulings. The evidence of this is that each one of the\u00a0reciters\u00a0may have erred, and there is no evidence from the intellect or the\u00a0revelation that we should follow a specific recitation.\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei explains (p. 165 \u2013 Arabic edition):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>\u201cThe reason that the reciters varied in their recitations is because the masahif (copies of the Qur\u2019an) that have been to the lands did not include diacritical marks, and this strengthens it (the view that the reciters recited the Qur\u2019an from their own ijtihad.)&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also says (p. 124 \u2013 Arabic edition) after explaining that the reasons of preserving the Qur\u2019an are plenty and available, and that which is in such a condition needs to be <em>mutawatir <\/em>in its nature. He adds:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>\u201c\u2026and whatever arrives only from the path of ahaad surely cannot be from the Qur\u2019an.\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the above, we come to the conclusion that Al-Khoei firmly believes that the Qur\u2019an\u2019s diacritical marks have all been added to the Qur\u2019an by fallible men, and that there is no way of determining which recitation is correct. Due to this, one cannot extract rulings from the Qur\u2019an. Of course, Al-Khoei does not explain this, but one understands that the only way of extracting rulings from the Qur\u2019an is if the infallible Imam extracts the rulings from a verse, or speaks of a verse in a context in which a ruling can be derived.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei (p. 167 \u2013 Arabic edition) finally admits that the intellect would cause one to re-read the Qur\u2019an, one recitation at a time, in order to encompass every verse of a <em>surah<\/em>. However, Al-Khoei asserts, this is nullified by the narration of the Imams who says that it is permissible to recite with these Sunni recitations (even if they are flawed).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two above views that Al-Khoei shares regarding the Qur\u2019an are self-destructive. His purpose from writing this book was to defend the Shia view of the Qur\u2019an, but his slip-ups in a couple of paragraph have exposed his beliefs a.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3- When was the Qur\u2019an Compiled According to Al-Khoei?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said (p. 255 \u2013 Arabic edition) after three pages of evidences that the Qur\u2019an was compiled during the life of the Prophet peace be upon him:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>\u201cHow can anyone say that the Qur\u2019an was compiled as late as the caliphate of Abi Bakr?\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then (p. 503 \u2013 Arabic edition) to prove that Ali was a memorizer of the Qur\u2019an, he argued that after the death of the Prophet peace be upon him, Ali swore to not wear a cloak until he collected the Qur\u2019an!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Admission that some Shias Believed in <em>Tahreef<\/em><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said on (p. 7):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5; color: #ff0000;\">&#8220;<\/span><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Of course, there has been a small group of traditionalists, both among Shi\u2019as and Sunnis, who held that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with.&#8221;<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: The Shia translators have translated the word (\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629) in the original Arabic to a \u201csmall group\u201d instead of \u201cgroup\u201d, since they were in damage control mode.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We say: We are in agreement that this is the view of some Shias, but we disagree that this is the view of Sunnis. We shall examine the evidences that Al-Khoei provides.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also said (p. 26) when discussing narrations of <em>tahreef:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>&#8220;Of course, the abundance of certain reports from Masumin (peace be upon them) gives us enough reason to presume that they have been correctly attributed. Among them are traditions which have been reliably reported, and therefore we do not see any need to go into the details of their authenticity.&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Al-Khoei himself rejects these narrations personally, even though he believes that they are authentic (p. 31):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>&#8220;To them we say that they have to interpret such reports the same way as those concerning the elucidatory additions in the codex prepared by Amir al Mominin(\u2018a). And if that sounds improbable, then the reports must be rejected as false because they are against the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Most of the reports in this vein are weak, while falsehood of some of them is evident from their content.&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notice that Al-Khoei is referring to most reports and not all. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt that he accepts that there are authentic narrations from Shia books that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refer to our article on ten authentic narrations from Shia sources that prove that Shia sources endorsed the idea of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/07\/24\/authentic-shia-narration-declaring-the-corruption-of-the-quran\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><em>tahreef<\/em>.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Accusations against Ahlulsunnah Regarding <em>Tahreef<\/em><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei, after providing thirteen narrations about abrogation, rejects the view that the Prophet was the cause behind the abrogation of verses. He argues (p. 13):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>&#8220;If one says that the Prophet (\u2018s) himself recommended it, then it is a claim which calls for substantiation. All Ulama\u2019 are agreed upon the principle that the Qur\u2019an cannot be superseded or abrogated by an isolate report \u2011 i.e. a tradition which has been reported singly. The jurists have made this abundantly clear in their works on the principles of jurisprudence. In fact, Shafi\u2019i and many other scholars go further to say that the Book of God, (i.e. the Qur\u2019an) cannot be superseded or abrogated by even those traditions which have reached continuity and acquired wide spread currency. This has been confirmed by Ahmed b. Hanbal in one of the two traditions reported by him. Even those who proposed that a continuous and widespread Sunnah may potentially supersede the Qur\u2019an, have confirmed that such a situation has in reality never occurred. In view of the foregoing, it is incorrect to ascribe the abrogation to the Prophet (\u2018s). Even those reports which mention the omissions clearly say that it occurred after the Prophet (\u2018s).&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To summarize, Al-Khoei is arguing that one cannot affirm that a verse is abrogated with a solitary report. This is because the Qur\u2019an is <em>mutawatir<\/em> (consecutive), while the narrations are <em>ahaad <\/em>(solitary).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Al-Khoei is mistaken in the application of this ruling upon the verses, for Sunni scholars were only referring to the <strong>established Qur\u2019an<em>. <\/em><\/strong>They were not talking about abrogated verses that do not exist in our Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To simplify, Al-Khoei\u2019s quotes from Sunni scholars portray a cautious group that will reject a hadith if it suggests the abrogation of a verse, since the hadith has less weight. Established Qur\u2019anic verses include rulings and are read in prayer, thus, it is mandatory to be cautious with them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, a hadith that speaks of a verse that was once Qur\u2019anic is not the same as an established verse in the Qur&#8217;an that is unanimously agreed upon, recited in prayer, and is used for legislation. Hence, there is nothing problematic with accepting a narration that says, \u201cThis was once a part of the Qur\u2019an,\u201d if the verse is no longer there, even if it is from a solitary authentic report.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Khoei\u2019s Criticisms towards the Sunni Stance of the Compilation of the Qur\u2019an<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this section, we list Al-Khoei\u2019s arguments against the Sunni view of the compilation of the Qur\u2019an. His arguments were listed in a question-answer format. We have highlighted those in red and will include our responses in black below his answers. It is important to note that when Al-Khoei is criticizing the Sunni view, he is referring to the twenty-two narrations that he has quoted from Sunni sources about that subject. He listed those narrations on p. 32-39.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">1- When was the Qur&#8217;an compiled as a book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The second report says it was compiled during the rule of Uthman. The first, third, fourth and some of the later reports explain that it was in the era of Abu Bakr. And the seventh and twelfth report indicate that it was during Umar&#8217;s caliphate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The common Sunni stance is that the Qur\u2019an was collected twice. One during the time of Abu Bakr when it was simply gathered into one book, while the second was during the time of Uthman, when he eliminated the <em>masahif<\/em> and gathered the people upon one recitation (as Al-Khoei admits on p. 47). This action by Uthman was referred to as \u201cUthman\u2019s collection of the Qur\u2019an\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the narrations that state that Omar compiled the Qur\u2019an, then those are weak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei\u2019s first narration comes through Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Khalad, who is anonymous according to the editor of Masahif Ibn Abi Dawud (the origin of the report). See 2\/748.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second narration can be found in Kanz Al-Ummal #4767, but it is simply a quote from Ibn Al-Anbari\u2019s book Al-Masahif. The latter has been lost for centuries, so we do not have access to the chain that contains this quote.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">2- Who undertook to compile the Qur&#8217;an during the era of Abu Bakr?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The first two traditions and the twenty second say that it was Zaid b. Thabit, but the fourth report says it was Abu Bakr himself; and that he only asked Zaid to go through what he himself had collected. And the fifth report together with the others indicate that the task was undertaken by Umar and Zaid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fourth report can be easily reconciled with the first, second, and twenty second traditions. The only information that the fourth narration adds is that Abu Bakr had collected the Qur\u2019an in parchments. This does not mean that he necessarily had collected the whole Qur\u2019an, but fragments only. If he had collected the whole Qur\u2019an, there would be no need for Zaid to \u201cgo through what he himself had collected.\u201d For those that don\u2019t consider this report reconcilable with the others, then one may dismiss it, for it is disconnected since it comes through the path of Salim and Kharija, who were both not born at the time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fifth report is easily reconcilable, since it suggests that Omar was given the task of assisting Zaid. Zaid is mentioned alone in other reports since he was given the main task.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">3- Was Zaid given sole authority to compile the Qur&#8217;an?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The first tradition clearly states that Abu Bakr gave him sole authority. He told Zaid: &#8220;You are a young, intelligent man, and we find no fault in you. You were also a scribe, writing down the revelations for the Messenger of Allah (\u2018s). So attend to the Qur&#8217;an and compile it&#8221;. These words are explicit. But the fifth and other traditions reveal that the writing was substantiated by two witnesses, so much so that when Umar came with the verse of rajm, it was rejected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are also easily reconcilable. The answer is that Abu Bakr gave Zaid the sole authority to conduct the compilation of the Qur\u2019an, which led to the gathering of witnesses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei\u2019s statement that Omar\u2019s request to add the verse of Rajm into the Qur\u2019an being rejected is weak. Al-Khoei only mentions this from the path of Al-Layth bin Sa\u2019ad who was born at the end of the first century.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">4- Were there some verses which remained unrecorded till the time of Uthman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Most of the traditions say that no verses remained unrecorded, but the second report says that some of the verses remained unwritten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a mistake by Al-Khoei. The second report may seem to indicate such if we hold the view that Zaid bin Thabit relied solely on the first <em>mus-haf<\/em>. However, according to evidences provided by Dr. M. M. Al-Azmi in his \u201cThe History of Qur\u2019anic Text\u201d p. 91-93, the first <em>mus-haf<\/em> was only used as a secondary source to correct what was gathered by Zaid in his second collection. Al-Azmi provides a solid narration by Ibn Shabba to illustrate that this was the case.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">5- Did Uthman omit anything from what was compiled before him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Most of the traditions quoted above say that he did not exclude or omit anything. But the fourteenth report tells us that he struck off some parts from the previous compilation, and ordered the Muslim to do the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is false. The narration states that Uthman erased his personal copy of the <em>mus-haf<\/em>. It does not say that he omitted anything from the compilation of Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">6- From what sources did Uthman prepare a book copy of the Qur&#8217;an? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The second and fourth report say: he relied upon the notes and pages collected by Abu Bakr. Then the eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth traditions reveal that he relied upon two witnesses, and upon those who claimed to have heard the ayah from the Prophet (\u2018s).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is easily reconciled since both occurred. Uthman had his commission rely on witnesses and then cross-checked it with the previous compilation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">7- Who asked Abu Bakr to compile the Qur&#8217;an?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The first report says that Umar did it, and that Abu Bakr conceded after having first refused. Then he sent for Zaid who also conceded after having declined. But the tenth report tells us that Zaid and Umar jointly asked Abu Bakr to undertake the work, and he conceded after having consulted the Muslims.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei quotes Sulaiman bin Arqam. He is weak according to the author of Al-Tahtheeb and the earlier sources of Rijal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">8- Who prepared the master copy and sent its editions to various cities?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The second report says it was Uthman, while the twelfth tells us it was Umar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration can be found in Kanz Al-Ummal #4767, but it is simply a quote from Ibn Al-Anbari\u2019s Masahif. It has been lost for centuries, so we do not have access to the chain that contains this quote.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">9- When were the two verses added to the Surah of Bara\u2019ah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The first, eleventh and twenty second reports reveal that this happened during the time of Abu Bakr, and the eighth report together with others say that it happened in the era of Umar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reports that mention that this happened during the time of Abu Bakr can be found in Saheeh Al-Bukhari. The report that mentions that this occurred during the time of Omar was narrated by Yahya bin Abdulrahman bin Hatim who was not even born during the time of Omar. The first report is the correct one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">10- Who came up with those two verses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The first and twenty second reports say they were brought in by Abu Khuzaimah, while the eighth and eleventh reports say it was Khuzaimah. These are two gentlemen who had no relationship with each other at all, as reported by Ibn Abd al Barr.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The eighth report mentions that this occurred during the time of Omar was narrated by Yahya bin Abdulrahman bin Hatim who was not even born during the time of Omar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The eleventh report comes from the path of Mohammad bin Omar Al-Waqidi who has been classified as a liar by many classical scholars.

Some narrators may have no knowledge of the whole committee and simply include those\u00a0they knew of, while others perhaps had access to additional knowledge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei was correct in a couple of these sub-points for pointing out that they are indeed contradictions. The third and fourth points are clearly contradictions and the fifth is simply problematic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The third point is weak, since it comes from the path of Ziyad bin Abi Al-Maleeh, who was weakened by Abu Hatim Al-Razi. This narration can be found in Al-Masahif by Ibn Abi Dawud. It is also considered disconnected since Al-Maleeh never heard from Uthman.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the inclusion of Ubai bin Ka\u2019ab in the committee, then we know it is false simply due to the consecutive narrations in other books that clearly show that his recitation is different than the recitation of Zaid. The narration quoted by Al-Khoei can be found in 5\/312 in Tabaqat Ibn Sa\u2019ad and it is weak since it comes from the path of Mohammad bin Omar Al-Waqidi, who was condemned as a liar by many classical scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we can see, most of these contradictions are easily reconcilable, especially after looking into the reliability of these reports. Ironically, Al-Khoei would have a harder time reconciling his beliefs about the compilation of the Qur\u2019an since they are in direct contradiction with one another as we have demonstrated above in the section about Al-Khoei\u2019s beliefs regarding the Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Additional Important Points Raised by Al-Khoei<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- After quoting some narrations about certain companions (four or six) having had \u201ccollected\u201d the Qur\u2019an during the time of the Prophet peace be upon him. Al-Khoei (p. 42) argued:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201cOne might argue that the collection or compilation mentioned in these reports denote committing the Qur&#8217;an to memory, and not to the papers. This presumption cannot be corroborated. Besides, it is a known fact that there were numerous believers at the time of the Prophet (\u2018s) who knew the Qur&#8217;an by heart, so how can the memorising of the Qur&#8217;an be confined to four or six names?\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei may have a point if one believed that the memorizing of the complete Qur\u2019an was exclusive to four or six men. However, this stance is rejected by Ahlulsunnah themselves. Ibn Hajar, for one, indicates that the narration of Anas was simply referring to those that memorized it from the Khazraj time. Refer to p. 48-51 of Dr. Noor Al-Deen Itr\u2019s \u201cJam\u2019 Al-Qur\u2019an Al-Kareem wa Tawtheequhu fi Ahdi Al-Nabi\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Al-Khoei argued (p. 46) when discussing the details of the two witnesses:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201cSurprisingly enough, Ibn Hajar interprets two witnesses as &#8220;written evidence&#8221; and &#8220;evidence of memorization&#8221;. I believe he had to take recourse to this interpretation so as to avoid a conflict with the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is based on tawatur.\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <em>tawatur<\/em> of the Qur\u2019an has been established through the memorization of the companions, as indicated by Al-Khoei himself (p. 45), so Ibn Hajar\u2019s point has nothing to do with establishing <em>tawatur<\/em>. If one simply wanted to establish <em>tawatur<\/em>, then one may have simply gathered a group of men, had them sit down, and together compile the Qur\u2019an. However, the companions, as Al-Khoei quoted in several narrations, gathered parchments, leather, bones, rocks, and other materials that included the Qur\u2019an as an additional condition for the inclusion of a verse in the compilation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei then argued:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000; line-height: 1.5;\">\u201cIt becomes quite probable that certain parts of the Qur&#8217;an which, though current and widespread, were omitted because there was no written evidence.\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This did not occur, for Zaid bin Thabit himself said that he had the whole Qur\u2019an but was waiting for a witness for a final verse. Al-Khoei attempts to cast doubt into the hearts of readers has went a full circle and seems to have caused him to forget what he quoted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, Al-Khoei\u2019s book, which was supposedly praised by both Sunnis and Shias according to the jokers at the World Federation of KSI Muslim Communities, is nothing more than a conversion tool.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Khoei\u2019s attempts to prove that Sunni sources teach that the Qur\u2019an has been manipulated has blown up in his face, for those are the teachings of his infallibles according to him. May Allah give the man what he deserves for making such a statement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2026and praise be to Allah the Most Gracious Most Merciful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645 The following is a response to Ayatullah Al-Khoei\u2019s book Al-Bayan fi Tafseer Al-Quran, namely, the two chapters entitled: \u201cThe Collection and Preservation of the Quran\u201d.
