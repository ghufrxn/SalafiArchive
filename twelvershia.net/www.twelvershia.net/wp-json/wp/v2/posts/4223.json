We have included chapter headings for the sake of order and clarity. Chapters have also been reordered for the sake of clarity as well. This article includes some of Yazeed\u2019s crimes which led some Sunni scholars to permitting the cursing of Yazeed.

Then he sent a delegation to Yazeed bin Mu\u2019awiyah, which included: Abdullah bin Abi Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mugheera Al-Makhzoomi, Mohammad bin Amr bin Hazm Al-Ansari, a man from sons of Suraqa from the sons of Adi bin Ka\u2019ab, and a group of men from Quraish. When they got to Madinah, they cursed Yazeed, disavowed themselves from him, and relinquished their pledge to him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Khalifa said: Wahb bin Jareer said to us: Juwairiya bin Asma\u2019 said to me: I heard some sheikhs from Madinah said that from among the delegation to Yazeed bin Mu\u2019awiyah was Abdullah bin Hanthala, and he had eight of his sons with him. He (Yazeed) gifted him a hundred thousand and gifted each of the men ten thousand dirhams, as well as some clothes and goods. When Abdullah bin Hanthala arrived at Madinah, some men came to him and said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He said, \u201cI come to you from a man that I would fight, by Allah, even if I had nobody with me other than my sons.\u201d They said, \u201cWe were told that he gave you gifts and treated you well.\u201d He said: \u201cHe did, and I wouldn\u2019t have accepted, but I wanted to use it to gain strength against him.\u201d He then encouraged the people, and they pledged their allegiance to him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Khalifa said: Abu Yaqthan said: They called to an agreement and a consultation and placed Abdullah bin Mutee\u2019 Al-Adawi as the head of Quraish, Abdullah bin Hanthala Al-Ghaseel upon the Ansar, and Ma\u2019qil bin Sinan Al-Ashja\u2019ee as the head of the tribes of the Muhajireen. They then drove out Uthman bin Mohammad bin Abi Sufyan from Madinah, and he was placed in charge by Bani Umayyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Khalifa said: Wahb narrated to me, he said: My father narrated to me from Ayoub, that Ibn Abbas asked about them while he was in Al-Ta\u2019if, so he was told, \u201cAbdullah bin Mutee\u2019 was made the head of Quraish and Abdullah bin Hanthala upon the Ansar.\u201d He said, \u201cTwo leaders?

When the people of Al-Sham saw them, they felt awe and hated to fight them. Muslim then had a bed placed between both armies, then ordered his crier to say: \u201cFight them off me or push them back fiercely.\u201d The men engaged in battle and heard a <em>takbeer<\/em> from within Madinah, for Banu Haritha aided the people of Al-Sham in breaking through and were on the ground. The men (of Madinah) were defeated while Abdullah bin Hanthala was lying down asleep onto his son. His son then woke him up. When he opened his eyes and noticed what has happened, he sent his eldest son to fight, who did until he was killed, and they kept on fighting one after the other until all his sons were killed. He (Abdullah) then broke his sword holster and fought until he was killed. Muslim bin Uqba then entered Madinah and called the people to pledge allegiance as slaves of Yazeed bin Mu\u2019awiyah, and that he is to decide the fate of their family, blood, and wealth. Abdullah bin Zam\u2019a, who was a close friend of Yazeed bin Mu\u2019awiyah, was brought forward. He (Muslim) said, \u201cPledge that you are a slave of the Commander of the Believers and that he is to decide the fate of your family, blood, and wealth.\u201d He said, \u201cI pledge to you that I am the cousin of the Commander of the Believers and that he is to decide the fate of my blood, family, and wealth.\u201d He (Muslim) said, \u201cKill him.\u201d Mawran then leaped, hugged him, and said, \u201cHe will pledge in whichever way you want!\u201d He (Muslim) said, \u201cBy Allah, I will never let him take it back,\u201d and then said, \u201cHe will move away, or else, kill them both.\u201d Marwan then let him go and Ibn Zam\u2019a was killed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Khalifa said: Abu Al-Hasan said: Awana said: When Yazeed bin Abdullah bin Zam\u2019a was brought to Muslim, he said, \u201cPledge your allegiance.\u201d He said, \u201cI pledge to you on the book of Allah and the <em>sunnah<\/em> of His prophet.\u201d He (Muslim) ordered that he (Yazeed bin Abdullah) was to be killed.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Death of the sons of Zaynab bint Ali<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Khalifa said: Wahb narrated to us: My father narrated to me: Al-Hasan narrated to us: When the sons of Zaynab were killed on the day of Al-Harrah, they were brought to her. She said, \u201cWe belong to Allah, and to Him we return! What happened to them is such a tragedy for me, and what happened to him (a son) is a greater tragedy than what happened to him (the other son).

When they came to Ibn Al-Zubair and offered him what Yazeed ordered, Ibn Al-Zubair said, \u201cDo you order me to pledge to a man who drinks alcohol and avoids prayer while going out on hunting trips?\u201d Hammam said, \u201cThat description fits you more closely.\u201d A man from Quraish then punched him (Hammam).

He came to Ibn Al-Zubair who was sitting at Al-Abtah with Ayoub bin Abdullah bin Zuhair bin Abi Umayyah Al-Makhzoomi during the reign of Al-Harith bin Khalid bin Al-Aas bin Hashim bin Al-Mugheera over Makkah.
