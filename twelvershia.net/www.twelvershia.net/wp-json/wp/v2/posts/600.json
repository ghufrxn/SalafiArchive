Since this Shariah should serve as a guide to humanity till the end of the times, that is why Allah took the responsibility of preserving the Quran Himself, because it is the main source of Shariah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The beauty of our Islamic law or Shariah is that it guides us in all spheres of our life. And its message is not for one race only, but it is for the entire humanity. That is why Allah bestowed the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) with the best family members, and the best companions, as they were the ones who were responsible to teach the Shariah to the people after the death of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). We can&#8217;t expect that the ones who are responsible for teaching the Shariah would hide Quran or its divine interpretation as Shias claim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly the life of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) should also be sufficiently known to the people because the Holy Quran says:<br \/>\n{There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.} [Quran 33:21]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now a part of the life of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) can be known from his companions, but a part of his life which deals with how he lived inside his home can only be learned from his wives, because he had no sons, and his four daughters were married before the battle of Uhud, which happened in 3 AH. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) knew this very well, and hence he put special effort in teaching his wives too, besides teaching his companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ummul Momineen Ayesha&#8217;s narrations mostly deal with how the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would live inside his home, and how he behaved with his family members. The fact is that in the Shia books, we rarely find the narration of any wife of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). And when Ummul Momineen Ayesha narrated how the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) lived in his home, the ignorant started accusing her of mentioning immoral things. But little do they know that if this is to be considered immorality, than this &#8216;immorality&#8217; is present in the narration of their Imams as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Response:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS starts by mentionning a movie called &#8220;The innocence of Muslims&#8221;, he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">we have a question: &#8216;Is the film depiction at variance with the portrayal of Prophet (saw) in the main corpus of authority Sunni works?&#8217;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">If you ask the average Sunni Muslim on the street, he will provide an impromptu response that it is. It is unlikely that most Sunni Muslims would have ever consulted any of these books, they have simply taken to the streets at the behest of their Mullah\u2019s who have through their incendiary speeches duped the masses into assuming that the film depiction of Muhammad (saw) is alien to Islam, and that people should therefore vent their anger by way of violent protest. What these poor adherents are not told is the truth, that the very depictions, that formed the basis for this obscene piece of film making is not out of kilter with the Sunni Muslim depiction of Muhammad (saw) in the authentic Sunni world, on the contrary it concurs with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I watched the first ten minutes of the movie, and I can say very easily that it is so disgusting that even a neutral person will declare that it is complete misrepresentation of what is present in the Sunni books. I am amazed at how on earth have the RTS claimed this nonsense!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s begin with the arguments of Shias and lets see whether the same can be found in the Shia books as well or not.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">We read in Saheeh Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 18:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated &#8216;Urwah: The Prophet asked Aboo Bakr for &#8216;A&#8217;isha&#8217;s hand in marriage. Aboo Bakr said &#8220;But I am your brother.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You are my brother in Allah&#8217;s religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Note how the narrator of this tradition is Urwah the nephew of Aisha, not Aisha herself who is presenting the discussion as an eye witness, by the side of Aboo Bakr, clear as he did not attribute the tradition to anybody else, saying I heard from so and so, rather he states the Prophet (saw) asked for the hand of Aisha and grandfather said &#8220;But I am your brother.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0Now think carefully Urwah is the younger brother of Abdullah ibn Zubair, who was born in Madina, and this alleged incident occurred when Aisha was six years of age!<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A lesson can be gauged from, the tradition.\u00a0\u00a0Aboo Bakr was initially apprehensive at the proposal as the Prophet (saw) was his brother thus making Aisha his niece, hence making such a union invalid.\u00a0\u00a0The Prophet (saw) draws up a clear distinction between brothers in religion and brother through bloodline.\u00a0\u00a0Does this not evidence Aboo Bakr\u2019s lack of knowledge on the matter?\u00a0\u00a0Is this not disrespectful of Aboo Bakr?\u00a0\u00a0The reality is this was an attempt by Urwah to establish some familial link with the Prophet (s). Sadly we know the bonds of brother were made between the companions on two occasion, and on both the Prophet (saw) took Imam Alee (a.s) as his brother nobody else!<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0We shouldn&#8217;t expect the people to have known the whole religion from the day they are born. Especially in the case of the companions, who were in the era when Islam was in the process of completion, rather than being in a complete form. Hence, Abu Bakr definitely had a question as the Prophet (saww) had declared him his brother. So he had a definite question if it would have similar effect on his relations with the Prophet (saww) as a biological brother will have. The Prophet (saww) clarified to him that it was not the case, Abu Bakr agreed to it and married his daughter to the Prophet (saww). I don&#8217;t find anything wrong with this, but what the Shia Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Taqi Musawi Isfahani\u00a0says in his book \u00a0&#8216;Mikyal al-Makarim&#8217; is definitely worth reading.<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We read in the book of Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Taqi Musawi Isfahani:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;there is a traditional report mentioned in Mazar Bihar and other books quoting Azadi that he said: In Medina I came out to go to the house of His Eminence, Abu Abdullah Imam Sadiq (a). On the way I met Abu Baseer, who was in a state of ritual impurity (requiring bath), although I didn\u2019t know at that time. Both of us together came to the Imam and saluted him. The Imam raised his head and said to Abu Baseer: O Abu Baseer, do you not know that it is inappropriate to enter the Prophet\u2019s houses in a state of ritual impurity? So Abu Baseer returned and after he had bathed, we came back to the Imam.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><sub><strong>Reference :\u00a0<a title=\"External link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.maaref-foundation.com\/english\/library\/pro_ahl\/imam12_mahdi\/mikyal_al-makarim\/32.htm\" rel=\"nofollow external\">Mikyal al-Makarim p. 776<\/a><\/strong><\/sub><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The infallible Imam of Shias exposed Abu Baseer, who would enter the house of the Prophet (saww) in the state of ritual impurity, while fully knowing that it was not allowed to enter the Holy Mosque in the state of ritual impurity. So if we have to criticize anyone, it should be Abu Baseer rather than Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Sahih al-Bukhari we read that `Ali (ra) for example was ignorant of a specific Fiqhi ruling:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I used to get emotional urethral discharge frequently.

But since the Shias have a deep hatred against Abu Bakr, they would not stop making a hill out of it as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly you should not expect from the narration that everything would be mentioned. Hence we don&#8217;t know a lot of things about the marriage of Fatima from `Ali according to the authentic Shia narrations. For example, we don&#8217;t know how she went to her new home.

Why would the Prophet (saww) marry her, especially if he had no love for her, and if she had virtue or honor? Let RTS clarify why did the Prophet (saww) marry her?

If he had learnt this from his forefathers, then it means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told this to Ali.

Being a male doesn&#8217;t mean that you could mention the private life to everyone. But the case we read is an exception, and it is a religious matter which is necessary to mention to the people.

I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry on! O Bani Arfida,&#8221; till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, &#8220;Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">If one inspects the tradition carefully, it is clear that Aisha watched the entire display whilst seated upon the shoulders of the Prophet (saw). Our claim can be evidenced by the fact that we are informed from Aisha\u2019s (la) testimony that she was standing behind the Prophet (saw) so how was she then capable of observing the entire spectacle cheek to cheek with the Prophet (saw)? Did she take some growth hormone that enabled her to rise in height to such dramatic proportions, to the point that she was cheek to cheek with the Prophet (saw)? Or did she climb on to some cushions. Or was she riding on the back of the Prophet (saw)? Just contemplate the ages of the spouses. Aisha (was had not yet attained majority age) whilst the Prophet (saw) was in his fifties. Was Aisha taller, shorter or the same size as the Prophet (saw)? If Aisha was of the same height or shorter she would have only been able to observe the spectacle cheek to cheek with the Prophet (saw), unless of course if she was on his (saw) shoulders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The history books suggest that the middle aged Prophet (saw) was of medium height. Aisha (had not yet hit puberty so was bound to increase in height, but it is unlikely that at that time she would have been the same height as the Prophet (saw). This being the case, precisely how could her taller husband have enabled her to see the event by telling her to stand behind him (saw)? How was she then able to stand behind the Prophet (saw) and observe the event cheek to cheek? The only possible way that this could have happened was if she was watching the event on the shoulders of the Prophet (saw).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Since Salafis always insist that their married lives should be a mirror image of that of the Prophet (saw) and Aisha we would urge them to accordingly implement this Sunnah forthwith. It is essential they avers such traditions and accordingly accompany their wives to male displays of bravado and wrestling. Naturally to ensure complete compliance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw) the Nasbieees should ensure that their wives are raised either through physical carrying or via lift supports (for the heavier Salafi female) so that she is accordingly positioned cheek to cheek with her spouse, that way both spouses can enjoy the display and ensure complete conformity with the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw)!\u00a0\u00a0Now we have some questions that we would invite the Salafis to clarify for us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Our Questions:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">1.

The Shia claims that it could mean two things, either the Prophet (peace be upon him) while fasting, read morning prayers, and then broke his fast, and later did Ghusl. Or the Prophet (peace be upon him) would miss night prayers, and morning prayers and then awake in the morning in the state of Junub and then perform Ghusl.

Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet.

When it is mentioned that the Prophet (saww) thought or assumed that he was doing a thing which he was actually not doing, it doesn&#8217;t mean that it happened every time, and this is a very simple thing to understand because if we knew that a person often forgets, this doesn&#8217;t mean that he forgets all the time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, if RTS has read only the narration of Ayesha, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned this to Ayesha only. This only proves that the narration was narrated by Ayesha. This same incident was also narrated by Ibn Abbas and Zaid ibn Arqam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet (saww) untied the knots in the material and this untying was enough to remove the strength of magic. Hence there was no need to remove the object.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also the Prophet (saww) never said that he didn&#8217;t want this matter to be disclosed to his subjects, this is no where mentioned in the Hadith of Bukhari. Rather the Prophet (saww) mentions regarding the question of Ayesha &#8216;Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?&#8217; And if that was the case, than Ibn Abbas and Zaid ibn Arqam would also not have mentioned this to Dhahhak and Thumama respectively.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Source: Sahih Bukhari. Vol. 7, Book 71, H. # 658.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated A&#8217;isha: A man called Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam from the tribe of Bani Zaraiq worked magic on Allah&#8217;s Apostle till Allah&#8217;s Apostle started imagining that he had done a thing that he had not really done. One day or one night he was with us, he invoked Allah (swt) and invoked for a long period, and then said, &#8220;O A&#8217;isha! Do you know that Allah (swt) has instructed me concerning the matter I have asked him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. One of them said to his companion, &#8216;What is the disease of this man?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Who has worked the magic on him?&#8217; The other replied, &#8220;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;What material did he use?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;A comb and the hairs stuck to it and the skin of pollen of a male date palm.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;(That is) in the well of Dharwan.&#8217; &#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some of his companions went there and came back saying, &#8220;O A&#8217;isha, the colour of its water is like the infusion of Henna leaves. The tops of the date-palm trees near it are like the heads of the devils.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? Why did you not show it (to the people)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Since Allah (swt) cured me, I disliked to let evil spread among the people.&#8221; Then he ordered that the well be filled up with earth.<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">This and the previous tradition are at variance with one another despite the narrator being A&#8217;isha.<\/span><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition we are informed of the tribe of Labaid<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In previous traditions there is no mention of the Prophet (saw) being accompanied by anyone when attending Dharwan, but here we are informed that companions were with him. A&#8217;isha does not elaborate on who these individuals were, one is therefore unsure whether this was due to extenuating circumstances or for her dislike of certain individuals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In the previous Hadeeth, upon his return from Dharwan A&#8217;isha asks\u00a0<strong>&#8220;<\/strong>Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?\u201d, buy here she seeks clarity to ascertain whether the products were made subject to a public display \u201cWhy did you not show it (to the people)?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Our question is why was she keen to know whether the items in questions had been shown to the public?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It is indeed unusual that Ai&#8217;sha wanted to know if the items used for the black magic has been displayed publicly, when the second man had already identified them to the Prophet (saw). A&#8217;isha knew the products that had been used, so why was she curious as to whether or not others had also seen them? Surely someone must have given these items to Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A&#8217;sam, a comb used by the Prophet (saw) with his hair on it. One presumes Aisha was no doubt confused as to how this item reached the possession of Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A&#8217;sam when she personally combed his hair.\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt that Aisha was favoured for this task, to the point that she even performed this task whilst the Prophet (saw) was in the mosque. Clearly this must have truly perplexed A&#8217;isha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now this is called freestyle speculations, in which the Shias are masters. So the comb was provided to Lubaid by the wife of the Prophet (saww) to whom he revealed his dream. Perhaps the Prophet (saww) trusted his wife more than the Shias, and he was more aware of his wife than the Shias. In any case, just because Lubaid was not mentioned in the previous tradition, it doesn&#8217;t mean contradiction. For it would mean that many verses of Quran are also contradictory, because in some verses, one fact is not mentioned, while in another verse, it is mentioned. For example, we read in the Holy Quran [7:150] that Moses grabbed Aaron from his head on one occassion, and regarding the very same occassion, we read in Holy Quran [20:94] that Moses grabbed Aaron from his head as well as beard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[007:150]\u00a0\u00a0When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: &#8220;Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?&#8221; He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: &#8220;Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[020:094]\u00a0\u00a0(Aaron) replied: &#8220;O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard nor by (the hair of) my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, &#8216;Thou has caused a division among the children of Israel, and thou didst not respect my word!'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So only an ignorant, like the writers at RTS, can consider this as contradiction. And just because Ayesha didn&#8217;t name few individuals doesn&#8217;t mean that this was due to her dislike for certain people. This especially can&#8217;t be accepted if we know that `Aisha narrated authentic virtues of this person whom the Shia claim she hated. The un-mentioning of their names in a far lesser incident like this one can not be considered dislike for them, by any sane person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as the question of Ayesha regarding why the Prophet (saww) didn&#8217;t take out that material is concerned, it is obvious that she wanted that the people realize that the Prophet (saww) was affected by this magic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Source: Sahih Bukhari. Vol. 7, Book 71, H. # 660<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated A&#8217;isha:\u00a0\u00a0Then one day he said, &#8220;O Aisha do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?&#8217; The latter replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has worked magic on him?&#8217; The other replied Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam, a man from Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a hypocrite.&#8217; The first one asked, What material did he use)?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;A comb and the hair stuck to it.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Where (is that)?&#8217; The other replied. &#8216;In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan&#8217; &#8221; So the Prophet went to that well and took out those things and said &#8220;That was the well which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then that thing was taken out&#8217; I said (to the Prophet ) &#8220;Why do you not treat yourself with Nashra?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">This tradition conflicts with the previous two discussed. In those we are informed that the Prophet (saw) was unsure if he had done something, here Aisha elaborates what this meant at the ground level, providing an actual example that in many ways clarifies matters.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly this black magic\u2019s effect was linked to conjugal relations, and it must have reached the hand of\u00a0\u00a0Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A&#8217;sam from that individual that would have sought it useful that the Prophet (saw) assumed he had had conjugal relations with his wife when he had in fact not.\u00a0\u00a0If it worked, it would have meant the Prophet (saw) not visiting some of his wives, as he would have assumed that he (saw) had spent the night with them when he had not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Lubaid bin Al-A&#8217;sam is referred to as a hypocrite, ally of the Jews. If one analyses history it is not difficult to identify such a category of person. Aisha manages to identify Lubaid bin Al-A&#8217;sam, so which individuals did he frequent with? Did he survive the Prophet (saw) or not?\u00a0\u00a0If he outlived him (saw) which group of Muslims did he attach himself with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition we are told that the used item were removed whilst in the other traditions we are told the well was filled with earth.\u00a0\u00a0When the Prophet approaches Dharwan he states \u201cThat was the well which was shown to me (in a dream)\u2026\u201d but he does not state this in the other traditions. In this tradition the second man discloses the precise location wherein the materials can be located &#8216;In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan&#8217; &#8221; whilst in the others he simply states \u201cIt is in the well of Dharwan\u201d. This tradition concludes with the Prophet refusing treatment with Nashra, no such reference is made of this offer by Aisha (la) in the other traditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again these are outright speculations to defame Ayesha [ra], which is why they don&#8217;t even make sense, for why would a wife of the Prophet [saww] want to cast a black magic upon her husband!? Especially if it could make him err regarding whether he had performed his conjugal rights or not. Secondly, there is no conflict, just few facts are elaborated more in this narration than in the previous narration. Elaboration or &#8220;extra detail&#8221; is never considered a contradiction by any knowledgeable person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as the identity of Lubaid al-Asam is concerned, the fact is that Shias don&#8217;t have the biography of a lot of companions of the Prophet [saww], perhaps RTS meant the Sunni books. The Sunni books have documented the biographies of much more people surrounding the Prophet [saww] than the Shias, rather even a big Shia narrator like Zurarah is also a very less documented person as far as his biography is concerned.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, RTS is trying to disprove the Hadith only on the basis that it has a few more elaborations than the previous narrations, which as I mentioned is never considered a contradiction. But by using the same principle, I can prove multiple contradictions between (1) The identity of the mother of the 12th Imam (2) The Hadith of Ghadeer (3) The incident of the house burning of Fatima (4) The incident of <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/05\/08\/fadak-prophetic-inheritance-qa\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Fadak<\/a> (5) The Mushaf of Fatima, etc. But for the time being, we shall leave it aside for the convenience of the readers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He continues:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Sahih Bukhari. Vol. 7, Book 71, # 661.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated A&#8217;isha: Magic was worked on Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he began to imagine that he had done something although he had not. One day while he was with me, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period and then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Do you know that Allah has instructed me regarding the matter I asked Him about?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is that, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me; one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. One of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is the disease of this man?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Who has worked magic on him?&#8221; The other replied, &#8216;Labid bin A&#8217;sam, a Jew from the tribe of Bani Zuraiq.&#8217; The (first one asked), &#8216;With what has it been done?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair stuck to it and a skin of the pollen of a male datepalm tree.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Where is it?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;In the well of Dharwan.&#8217; Then the Prophet went along with some of his companions to that well and looked at that and there were date palms near to it. Then he returned to me and said, &#8216;By Allah the water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palms were like the heads of devils&#8221; I said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?&#8221; He said, &#8216;No! As for me Allah has healed me and cured me and I was afraid that (by Showing that to the people) I would spread evil among them when he ordered that the well be filled up with earth, and it was filled up with earth&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Further contradictions abound between traditions. In the second tradition Lubaid bin Al-A&#8217;sam is unknown, here we know his faith and his tribe. In the previous tradition Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A&#8217;sam is referred to as a hypocrite ally of the Jews whilst here he is a Jew.\u00a0\u00a0In this tradition he ventures to the well with companions whilst in two previous traditions no mention is made of him being accompanied by anyone.\u00a0\u00a0In the previous traditions the Prophet (saw) asks a rhetorical question and expands on what has been disclosed to him, before A&#8217;isha answers.\u00a0\u00a0But here A&#8217;isha is given the opportunity to respond and asks\u00a0<strong>,\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;What is that, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0His tribe has been mentioned in the previous narration as well, so that is a mis-statement by RTS itself. Secondly, as far as his religion is concerned, we know for sure that the hypocrites were not atheists, before apparently embracing Islam. They all had some religion, so Lubaid was a Jew, who apparently embraced Islam, and hence he was considered a hypocrite. As far as the other so called tradition is mentioned by RTS that in the two previous traditions, no mention is made of him being accompanied by anyone, then you can see in the tradition\u00a0<strong>Book 71, H. # 658\u00a0<\/strong>which has been mentioned earlier, that there it was mentioned that the Prophet [saww] <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&#8216;<em>along with some of his companions went there and came back<\/em>&#8216;.<\/span> Hence this is another mis-statement by RTS.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Saheeh Bukhari. Vol. 8, Book 73, # 89.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated A&#8217;isha: The Prophet (saw) continued for such-and-such period imagining that he has slept (had sexual relations) with his wives, and in fact he did not. One day he said, to me, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding a matter about which I had asked Him. There came to me two men, one of them sat near my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), &#8216;What is wrong with this man? The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;Who had worked magic on him?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;Lubaid bin Asam.&#8217; The first one asked, &#8216;What material (did he use)?&#8217; The other replied, &#8216;The skin of the pollen of a male date tree with a comb and the hair stuck to it, kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan.&#8221;&#8216; Then the Prophet went to that well and said, &#8220;This is the same well which was shown to me in the dream. The tops of its date-palm trees look like the heads of the devils, and its water looks like the Henna infusion.&#8221; Then the Prophet ordered that those things be taken out. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Won&#8217;t you disclose (the magic object)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has cured me and I hate to circulate the evil among the people.&#8221; A&#8217;isha added, &#8220;(The magician) Lubaid bin Asam was a man from Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition (unlike the previous) the Prophet (saw) makes no form of supplication that enables the reality to be revealed to him. The tradition from Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Number 66 informs us \u2018The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?&#8217; The latter replied the is under the effect of magic whilst this tradition informs us The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), &#8216;What is wrong with this man?\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact this tradition is very similar to the tradition of\u00a0<strong>Book 71, H. # 660.<\/strong>\u00a0There is only the mentioning of invocation in the words\u00a0<em>&#8216;<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">about which I had asked Him&#8217;\u00a0<\/span><\/em>just like in this tradition. And everyone can understand that this means invocation. So it is clearly mentioned in this narration. As far as the second contradiction is concerned, that is a contradiction but a minor one, and the narrations in such cases are not rejected, neither in the Sunni science of hadith, nor in the Shia science of hadith, and plenty of examples can be given from the Shia books, and the one with the better chain of transmission is given superiority in such case. Such minor contradictions arise in the narrations often in the transmission of the narration, since the narrators are humans who can err in the details, even if they are truthful.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Sahih Bukhari. Volume 8, Book 75, Number 400.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated &#8216;Aisha: that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion of Hinna, and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn and harm others with)&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Notice how in the very first tradition the Prophet (saw) keep all the items in the well, but here A&#8217;isha asks \u201c<strong>Why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?\u201d<\/strong>That suggests he removed the comb and hair!\u00a0\u00a0This question is not asked in the previous traditions.<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exact translation in this case should be &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you take it out?&#8217; since in the original Arabic text, the exact word for the skin of pollen has not been used, the translator has mentioned the words &#8216;the skin of the pollen&#8217; but they are not found in the Arabic text, and he might have considered it to be referring to the skin of pollen, but that can be his personal view. As far as the original text of the narration is concerned, we don&#8217;t find it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The entire notion of the Prophet (saw) becoming a victim of witchcraft is indeed a deeply shameless one! It makes a mockery of the doctrine of Prophethood, wherein the appointed one of Allah (swt) loses his thinking capability blurred by witchcraft, and is of the actions that he has performed. The difficulty is when A&#8217;isha has narrated it, then there is some need for him to find an appropriate place to record it, but where? What is the precise nexus between these traditions and their being placed in a Chapter that deal with the creation and good manners?\u00a0\u00a0What can one learn from good manners by reading a Hadeeth that discusses black magic being performed on the Prophet (saw)?<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The Prophethood would suffer if the Prophets can commit mistakes in matters dealing with the preaching of religious rulings and beliefs, although since they are divinely corrected if they commit mistakes, this also doesn&#8217;t cause problem in the prophethood. But as far as matters apart from the religion is concerned, they can forget and they can commit mistakes as well. If this is indeed a disgusting opinion, than this was the view of heavyweight Shia scholars such as Shaikh Sadooq, Shaikh ibn al-Waleed and a number of other major Shia scholars. And this is also evidenced by authentic Shia narrations. But as far as witchcraft is concerned, we read in the Holy Quran [20:66] that the rods and the ropes which the magicians threw appeared to be moving to Moses. So it means that the spell worked on the Prophets as well. But since they are divinely protected, hence Allah protects them. And that is what Allah did when he protected Moses from the magicians and that is what Allah did when he protected the Prophet [saww] from the magic of Lubaid ibn al-Asam. Rather in this incident is a virtue of the Prophet [saww] that Allah protected him and showed him the truth in his dream. If he was not a divinely appointed Prophet, he would not have been informed with how the plot was made.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS finally concludes:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">From this, one can only conclude that according to the Nasibi Aqeeda based on the Qur&#8217;aanic passages above and their most authentic books of Hadeeth the Prophet (saw) was not righteous and Allah (swt) therefore decided to hand him over to the power and control of Satan by the effects of magic, or Allah (swt) wasn\u2019t powerful enough to save his chosen Apostle (saw) from this.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0649 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650\u00a0\u0643\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064c \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062c\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u064a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627\u00a0\u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0638\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u00a0\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0651 \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0645\u064e\u0651\u0633\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat&#8221;\u00a0And the wrongdoers (disbelievers)\u00a0say: &#8220;You follow none but a man bewitched&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Holy Qur&#8217;aan\u00a0<\/strong><strong>(25.8)<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A&#8217;isha took a stand with the oppressive polytheists that accused the messenger of Allah (swt) of been bewitched.

As far as this verse is concerned, it doesn&#8217;t mean that those who say that the Prophet [saww] was bewitched are wrongdoers, and if that was the case, then does RTS believe that all the Shia scholars who agreed with the Sunnis are wrongdoers? The right interpretation of this verse is that the wrongdoers said that the Prophet [saww] is visited by the Satan, rather than an angel Gabriel, and Satan deceived him. The disbelievers never claimed that a true prophet was safe from magic, so we should understand this verse in its context rather than trying to misinterpret it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The first conclusion is that the articles of revisiting the Salaf are a waste of time, the only thing they&#8217;re good at is providing scans of pages from PDF books they download from online.
