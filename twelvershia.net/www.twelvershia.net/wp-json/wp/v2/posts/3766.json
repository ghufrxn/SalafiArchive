The time period that is placed under the microscope is the pre-Ghaybah era in which early Shias flocked in search of their Imams. The article aims to debunk myths about Imamate and to display to readers the sort of confusion that early Shias found themselves when it came to identifying the Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We will only be using <u>authentic<\/u> narrations from Shia sources in this article.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The Number of Imams<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Timing of Appointments<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams <\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The Secrecy of the Imamate<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The Number of Imams<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first misconception that we will find many Shias falling into is the assumption that Shias were known as Twelvers early on. Though, those that are familiar with the splits among the Shia communities of old, will be aware that this was not the case at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The early Shias were known as Al-Qat\u2019eeyah. They are those that affirmed that Musa Al-Kathim passed away, unlike many other Shias that disagreed and believed that he was still alive. The name Al-Qat\u2019eeyah was recorded in the books of Sa\u2019ad bin Abdullah Al-Asha\u2019ri and Al-Nawbakhti (p. 86) and was also recorded by Sunnis historians like Al-Malti (Al-Tanbeeh p. 26), Abu Hasan Al-Ash\u2019ari (Maqalaat p. 34), and Al-Shihristani (Al-Milal p. 111).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The name Al-Qat\u2019eeyah came into being after the passing of Musa Al-Kathim in the year 183 AH. \u00a0This suggests that the name: Itha Ashariyya, is a very late name. It is not possible to suggest that they were known as Twelvers before Musa Al-Kathim, since if that was the case, there wouldn\u2019t be a reason for a name change in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By returning to specific narrations, we find that the Qat\u2019eeyah themselves clearly did not know how many Imams there would be. Abu Jareer Al-Qummi asks Al-Redha if his father Al-Kathim went into Ghaibah, suggesting that he did not believe that the Imams were twelve, but they could have been seven. (Al-Kulayni 1\/237)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In another narration, Ayoub bin Nuh, one of the close companions of Al-Redha, after seeing that people have all pledged their allegiance to Al-Redha, came to the assumption that he was the Mahdi. (Al-Kulayni 1\/210)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Again, the very suggestion that the Mahdi is the seventh or eighth Imam shows that early Shias were not familiar with the belief that the Imams had to be twelve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another aspect that should be taken into consideration is that according to early Shia narrations, the Mahdi should have come much earlier, way before the time of the twelfth Imam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Al-Baqir said, \u201cAllah had deemed the year 70 as the time, but when Al-Hussain was killed He was so angered that He delayed it until the year 140. When we told you of this, you spread it the secret, and so Allah kept the time away from us.\u201d (Al-Kulayni 1\/229)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq said, \u201cThe time was going to come in the year 140, but we spoke of this to you, and you have spread this, so Allah delayed it.\u201d (Al-Nu\u2019mani p. 303)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The previous two narrations are clear that the \u201ctime\u201d was going to come way before the appointment of all twelve of the Imams. So it makes no sense that the Shias would be referred to as Twelvers in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Timing of Appointments <\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It goes without saying that if the number of the Imams weren\u2019t known, it is only natural to believe that their identities weren\u2019t known either. There are several cases in which we find some of the top companions of the Imams being completely unaware of who the next Imam was. This is clear evidence that the full list of who the Imams were was not known to anyone. According to a lengthy narration, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 made it known who some of Ahlulbayt were (i.e. Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain), but did not list all the Imams. (Al-Kafi 1\/172)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first and most straightforward evidence that affirms this is that whole list of Imams was not available to the Imams themselves was that Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq, in two separate narrations, says that the Imam does not pass away until Allah tells him who the next Imam will be. (Al-Kulayni 1\/166) The narration is clear that this information was not privy to him from the start of the Imamate, but rather, it becomes known to him towards the end of his life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This is even clearer in the narration of Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar, in which Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq tells him to accept Musa Al-Kathim as his next Imam, and that Ja\u2019afar was ordered by Allah to not tell anyone before Al-Faydh bin Al-Mukhtar. (Al-Kulayni 1\/188)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We also find that Ali Al-Hadi when asked about who the next Imam was, he told his student, Isma\u2019eel bin Mihran, to not fear for his safety. Years later, when asked again, he said, \u201cNow you may fear for my safety, the matter (of Imamate) is to my son Ali.\u201d (Al-Kulayni 1\/198)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Ignorance of the Top Companions of the Imams<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another fact that needs to be taken into consideration is that some of the top students of the Imams were not aware of the whole list of Imams. Not only that but some of them were not aware of who the Imam of their time was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Zurarah bin A\u2019ayan, the top Shia scholar during the time of Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq, according to Al-Najashi (p. 175), did not know the identity of the next Imam. When Ja\u2019afar died, his son Abdullah sat in his position and started to teach the Shias. Zurarah then sent his son Ubaid in order to find out who the Imam was. Zurarah passed away before accepting Musa bin Ja\u2019afar as the Imam. (See Al-Kashshi p. 117)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A similar scenario is that of Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Fadhal, who died in the year 224 AH. According to a narration, he accepted Al-Kathim while upon his deathbed. When asked about his allegiance to Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar, who Ibn Fadhal previous assumed was the Imam, he said, \u201cWe looked in the books and found nothing about Abdullah.\u201d (Rijal Al-Kashshi p. 400) It is important to note that Ibn Fadhal, who was considered to be one of the most pious Shias of his time, spent his whole life following a false Imam without evidence, nor was he aware of the appointment of Al-Kathim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When Salim bin Abi Hafsa, a Zaidi, asked Abu Ubaida Al-Hatha\u2019 who his Imam was, Abu Ubaida answered, \u201cMy Imams are the Aal of Mohammad.\u201d Salim responded, \u201cI see that you do not know your Imam.\u201d (See Al-Kashshi p. 172)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In an even stranger narration, Hanan bin Sadeer asked Al-Baqir if Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah was an Imam. (Ali bin Babawaih p. 193) This narration suggests that even followers of the Imams were not necessarily aware of the identities of the previous Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even though it is common knowledge that the Imamate is inherited through direct descendants, during the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> century, we find that Mohammad bin Isma\u2019eel bin Bazee\u2019 asked Al-Redha as to whether the successor of the Imam can be an uncle or a brother, which means that he wasn\u2019t even aware that Imamate was exclusive to sons. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 191)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is very important to be aware that the Twelver community of the fourth century was aware of the ignorance of the early Shias, which caused some of them to completely reject the notion that there are clear textual evidences for the appointment. (Al-Khazzaz p. 61)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Appointment of a Single Successor<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is very important to keep in mind that the Imams did not share the full list of Imams. When asked, they would either not provide them with the name of their successor, or they would only mention the name of the very next Imam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For example, Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq gives instructions to Abdula\u2019ala bin A\u2019yan, the brother of Zurarah, of the procedures to identifying the Imam when the previous Imam passes away. Al-Sadiq, instead of providing him with a list of names of the Imams, provides him with the procedures. (Al-Kulayni 1\/236) The same occurs with Mohammad bin Muslim Al-Thaqafi, one of Ja\u2019afar\u2019s closest companions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 225)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, as explained in another <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2017\/01\/07\/identifying-infallible-imam\/\">article<\/a>, the Imams often provided their followers with signs, instead of a list of whom the successive Imams were going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another example is when Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq was asked by Nasr bin Qaboos about who the next Imam was, he said that it would be Musa Al-Kathim. Then, when Musa was asked, Nasr asked him, and he said it would be Al-Redha. (Al-Kashshi p.322) Neither Al-Sadiq nor Al-Kathim provided Nasr with a list of Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It should also be known that those that accepted the Imams of their times do not show any knowledge of who the next succeeding Imams are going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Amr bin Huraith for instance, meets up with Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq, and lists out his beliefs. He then mentions his acceptance of the six Imams. Ja\u2019afar does not fill him in on the rest of the Imams, but rather, confirms his statements. (Al-Kashshi p. 299)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The same occurs with Mansoor bin Hazim (Al-Kashishi p. 301), Khalid Al-Bajali (Al-Kashshi p. 302), and Al-Hasan bin Ziyad (Al-Kashshi p. 303).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The Secrecy of the Imamate<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another matter that led to the confusion surrounding the Imamate of the Imams was that their lives were enshrouded in secrecy. The Imams was very secretive in nature. There are even cases in which the Imams would tell their students not to teach of their Imamate. This led to the ignorance of their students in regards to the identities of the Imams and the appointment of their successors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When asked about his Imamate, Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq completely denies that he is an Imam when approached by two Zaidi men. They then tell him that they heard this from some of pious followers in Al-Kufa. Al-Sadiq continued to deny it. (Al-Kulayni 1\/138\u00a0 \/ Al-Kashshi p. 305)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In one report, Hisham bin Salim met a man from Bani Makhzoom in Madinah. They discussed the topic of Imamate, so the man asked, \u201cWho is the Imam today?\u201d He replied, \u201cJa\u2019afar bin Mohammad <em>alaihi al-salam<\/em>.\u201d He said, \u201cBy Allah, I will tell him!\u201d Hisham reported that he was filled with fear upon hearing this and was afraid that the Imam would rebuke him or cast him away. (Al-Kashshi p. 200)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The secrecy involved in the Shiasm of the Imams was so deep, that the Imams would intentionally teach their own Shia followers from Iraq conflicting knowledge. (Al-Kulayni 1\/39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At times, the secrecy was so great that the Imams would not share knowledge with their followers in front of their very own children. This occurred between Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq and his son Abdullah when Abu Al-Baseer asked him questions. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 210)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The secrecy was so severe that even the <strong>children of the Imams<\/strong> were genuinely not aware of these appointments ever being made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah, the son of Ali bin Abi Talib, said to his nephew, \u201cYour father did not appoint an Imam.\u201d (Al-Kulayni 1\/215)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a clearer narration, Zaid bin Ali, in a conversation with Abu Ja\u2019afar Al-Ahwal about Imamate, claimed that he never heard such a thing from his father Zain Al-Abideen. He refuted Abu Ja\u2019afar Al-Ahwal by saying, \u201cMy father used to make the hot food warm out of pity for me, are you suggesting that he didn\u2019t have any pity over me going to hell?!\u201d (Al-Kulayni 1\/100)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The secrecy that surrounded the Imams prevented the message of Imamate to spread. At one point, in Makkah, only four people accepted the message of Imamate during the time of Al-Baqir. (Al-Kashshi p. 179) \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Alternative Methods of Determining Imamate<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2017\/01\/07\/identifying-infallible-imam\/\">previous article<\/a>, we have listed the methods as to how one would determine who the next Imam would be. However, upon investigation, we found that these methods were not always used.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hisham bin Salim, instead of seeking evidence for an appointment, resorted to testing Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar as the Imam by questioning him in basic arithmetic. Upon failing the test, he rejected Abdullah\u2019s claim to Imamate. (Ali bin Babawayh p. 209) The very fact that Hisham had to resort to this makes it clear that he and his companions never heard of an appointment from Ja\u2019afar for his son Musa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, as we have previously mentioned above, Ibn Fadhal accepted Abdullah as an Imam without hearing of an appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In one strange case, Al-Husain bin Omar, tells Al-Redha that he will accept him as an Imam simply because Al-Redha made that claim. He affirms that he did not hear of Al-Kathim making an appointment. He states that he will complain to Allah on the Day of Judgment if Al-Redha turned out to be a false Imam the same way his father will complain to Allah about Musa Al-Kathim, since he was initially a follower of Abdullah the brother of Musa. (Al-Kashshi p. 305)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the methods of finding out who the appointed Imam was is through the \u201cweapon\u201d, for the Imam is the one that inherits the weapon of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 according to some narrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The sons of Abi Al-Sammal respond to Al-Kathim by saying, \u201cWho knows the weapon anyhow?!\u201d (Al-Kashshi p. 338)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Indeed, the point they brought up is a fair one, for it was not possible for one to arrive at a conclusion as to whether an artifact was owned by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 simply by looking at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What about Narrations that Name all Twelve Imams?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From the above, we have established that early Imamis did not believe that the Imams were twelve, nor were they aware of their identities. At best, they were only notified during the time of the current Imam. This opposes the commonly held view that the companions of the Imams had full lists of who the Imams were going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, even with the overwhelming <strong>authentic<\/strong> evidence that we have provided, some stubborn Shias may still insist that the identity of the Twelve Imams were always known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Generally, they will provide two arguments for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">They will usually quote the hadith of Jabir bin Samura, which is found in the Saheehain, which suggests that the caliphs are twelve.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are other narrations that contain the number of the Imams, while other include the full list of the Imams. These narrations clearly contradict the narrations that are provided in this article.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Our response is as follows:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The existence of this Sunni narration did not faze any other early Shia sect that disagreed over the number of the Imams. Not only is Jabir bin Samura not reliable according to Shias, but Shiasm does not rely upon Sunni hadiths to establish its own views. Moreover, as we have proved earlier, the Twelvers themselves did not identify themselves with that name, but were known as Al-Qat\u2019eeya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Note: For a complete refutation of the Hadith of the Twelve Caliphs, please refer to this <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/12\/hadith-of-twelve-caliphs\">article<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In response to the second point, firstly, for the sake of clarity, we shall refer to narrations that affirm the Imamate of the Twelve by name or number as (Set B), while referring to the narrations that have been quoted in our article above as (Set A). It is not reasonable for any person that respects their own intellect to prefer Set B over Set A for the following reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For starters, it is historically accurate that Shias often differed in the numbers of the Imams. This is an irrefutable fact that is attested to by early historians. If Set B was accurate, then these sects wouldn\u2019t have existed in the first place. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, Twelvers would have been known as Twelvers, and not Al-Qat\u2019eeya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even the most famous narration that suggests that all the Imams were known \u2013 the narration of Abu Hashim Al-Ja\u2019afar &#8211; was doubted by Mohammad bin Yahya Al-Attar, the teacher of Al-Kulayni. He commented, \u201cI wish this narration came from the path of someone other than Ahmad bin Abi Abdullah, suggesting that it contradicts what is commonly known about the ambiguity of the Imamate. (Al-Kulayni 1\/337)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In some cases, a narration from Set A, would be transformed into a Set B narration. For example, a narration in Al-Kafi 3\/211 contains a supplication taught by Musa Al-Kathim which refers to the Imams without mentioning their names. However, the same exact narration can be found in Al-Saduq\u2019s Man La Yahtharhu Al-Faqeeh p. 158 with an addition of the explicit naming of all twelve Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Below we have included some of our favorite examples of fabrications in order to open the eyes of the doubting Shias:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Fabrication that Omar, Uthman, and A\u2019isha Narrated Hadiths of Twelve Imams<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 167) that Omar said: The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him and his household \u2013 said: \u201c\u2026my household are from the children of Ali, Fatima, Al-Hasan, Al-Hussain, and nine grand Imams from the children of Al-Hussain, they are my <em>itra<\/em> from my flesh and blood.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in his Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 169) that Uthman said: I heard the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him and his household \u2013 say: \u201cThe Imams after me are twelve, nine of them are from the progeny of Al-Hussain\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi narrates in Kifayat Al-Athar (p. 289) that A\u2019isha said, that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him and his household \u2013 heard Jibreel list out the names of each of the Imams, one by one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is needless to say that <strong>none<\/strong> of these narrations are authentic in Sunni nor Shia standards. However, it just shows the lengths taken by these fabricators. Al-Khazzaz Al-Qummi goes on to narrate such narrations from over twenty companions. However, we have hand-picked the above since they are seen by Shias as enemies of Ali. This shows that the fabrications are even more unbelievable since these \u201cenemies\u201d would never narrate such a thing since it would be used against them and their rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Leader of Jaroodiyya Zaidism<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another example that is worth mentioning is what Al-Kulayni has narrated in Al-Kafi 1\/342 from the path of Abu Al-Jarood from Al-Baqir from Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, that he saw Fatima with the whole list of the names of the twelve Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, this goes against the teachings of Abu Al-Jarood himself. Abu Al-Jarood is Ziyad bin Al-Munthir, to whom the Jaroodiyya Zaidi sect ascribes to. Al-Nawbakhti, when describing the teachings of the sect in his Firaq Al-Shia p. 31-32 affirms that the sect does not believe in the appointment of any of the Imams except for the first three. It also doesn\u2019t specify the number of Imams and believes that there can be more than one Imam at one time. It should be noted that Abu Jarood never believed in Al-Baqir or Al-Sadiq as Imams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Fabrication attributed to the Main Scholars of the Waqifi Sect<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Waqifi sect believed in seven Imams, with Musa Al-Kathim being the last of the Imams. However, that didn\u2019t stop Twelvers from attributing narrations to them that affirmed all twelve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some fascinating examples of Waqifi scholars that have fallen victim to such attributions include the creator of the sect, like Ali bin Abi Hamza. (Al-Ghaybah by Al-Tusi p. 63-64) Not only does the fabrications affirm the name and the number \u201ctwelve\u201d, but also includes that whoever rejects any of them is an unbeliever. (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Not surprisingly, if one were to return to Ali bin Ahmad Al-Musawi\u2019s \u201cFi Nusrat Al-Waqifa\u201d (via Al-Tusi\u2019s Al-Ghaybah p. 55, 56, 60), one would find that Ali bin Abi Hamza actually taught that the Musa Al-Kathim is the final Imam and that he never died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Other examples of this include Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Hamza (Al-Khazzaz p. 235-238) Hanan bin Sadeer (Al-Khazzaz p. 329), Mohammad bin Al-Hasan bin Shammoun and Sama\u2019a bin Mihran (Al-Kafi 1\/343), who are all established figures in the sect.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In conclusion, we are left with two scenarios in regards to the two sets of narrations, A and B. If Set B is authentic, then we must believe that the Imams hid away the names of the Imams from their closest companions and family members, while sharing this knowledge with their enemies who usurped the caliphate and created new sects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There shouldn\u2019t be a shred of doubt left that Set A is the orthodox Shia stance, since it is clearly not as ideologically loaded as the narrations of Set B.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even though we have presented powerful authentic evidences from Shia sources themselves, we know that it is up to the readers to choose to open their hearts. Selective retention and a forced skimming through the text, instead of an open-minded study of the text, could cause one to shrug off even the strongest of arguments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The evidences for the lack of clarity and the chaos of everything Imamate in the first centuries cannot be denied. However, as the centuries passed the chaos subsided, which led to generation after generation of Shias that did not question what they were upon, nor to look into the chaos from which they came. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">May Allah guide the truth-seekers among the Shia to His true path. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The article takes an depth look at aspects of Imamate in light of the understanding displayed by early Shia society.
