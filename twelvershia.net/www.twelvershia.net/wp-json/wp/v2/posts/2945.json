However, there is a statement that has caused confusion to many, and it is: \u201cHe calls them to paradise and they call him to hellfire,\u201d and we barely find explanations for these words. Most of those that have explained them simply stick to explaining what is meant by \u201cthe transgressive group\u201d and what went down between Ali and Mu\u2019awiyah, and they go into detail when explaining these things, but seldom do we find anything comprehensive for \u201cthey call him to hellfire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This narration appears twice in Saheeh Al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, in the Book of Prayer, from the path of Abdulaziz bin Al-Mukhtar from Khalid Al-Hatha\u2019 and so on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Bukhari said (427): Ibn Abbas said to me and to his son Ali, \u201cGo to Abu Sa\u2019eed and listen to what he narrates.\u201d So we went and found him in a garden looking after it. He picked up his garment, wore it and sat down and started narrating until the topic of the construction of the mosque reached. He said, \u201cWe were carrying one brick at a time while Ammar was carrying two. The Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; saw him and started removing the dust from his body and said, \u2018Woe onto `Ammar. He will he killed by the transgressive group. He will be inviting them to Paradise and they will invite him to Hellfire.\u2019 Ammar said, \u2018I seek refuge with Allah from affliction.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, he narrates it in the Book of Jihad, from the path of Abdulwahab Al-Thaqafi from Khalid Al-Hatha\u2019 and so on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Bukhari said (2601): Ibn Abbas said to me and Ali bin Abdullah, \u201cGo to Abi Sa\u2019eed and hear his hadith,\u201d So we came to him and his brother at a wall that they were irrigating, and when he saw us he wrapped his garment and sat, then said, \u201cWe used to move the bricks for the Masjid one at a time, while Ammar moved two at a time. The Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by and wiped the dust from Amma\u2019s head and said, \u2018Woe to Ammar, he will be killed by the transgressive group. Ammar calls them to Allah and they call him to hellfire.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, most contemporaries copy Ibn Hajar\u2019s understanding of the hadith from his Fath Al-Bari. He explains that Mu\u2019awiyah is the caller to hellfire and says: \u201cThey believed that they were calling to heaven and they weren\u2019t in reality, but they are excused due to what appeared to them in their <em>ijtihad<\/em> and cannot be blamed, so their calling to go against Ali is actually a call to hellfire, but it doesn\u2019t necessitate hellfire since they were <em>mujtahideen<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/islamqa.info\/en\/201963\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Refer to this article for more on this possible interpretation.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Al-Kashmiri in his Al-Faydh Al-Bari 2\/72 responded to this popular interpretation: \u201cI do not find this interpretation satisfying, because these wordings are taken from the Qur\u2019an and are used for the disbelievers, and I do not wish to apply this upon the Sahaba may Allah be pleased with them, Allah has said (upon the tongue of a follower of Musa): \u2018How is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the hellfire?\u2019 (Ghafir: 41) He also said, \u2018Those are callers to hellfire and Allah calls to paradise.\u2019 (Al-Baqara: 221).\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He (Al-Kashmiri) then stated that Mu\u2019awiyah is who is meant by the \u201ctransgressive group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He continues: \u201cAs for him saying, \u2018he calls them to heaven,\u2019 then it is a continuation of how he is with the disbelievers and Quraish, and a signal to what he faced from Quraish and their torture, and their forcing upon him to disbelieve, but he would only say: \u2018Allah is one\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Kashmiri was correct in this but he left out the strongest evidence for his opinion, and he was beaten to it by Ibn Battal in his explanation of Saheeh Al-Bukhari 5\/27 who said something similar: \u201cTo \u2018call them to Allah\u2019 is \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 about the people of Makkah that caused him to leave his home and tortured him for the sake of Allah due to him calling them to Allah. It is not possible for this to refer to Muslims at all since they have entered the call of Allah, and Allah only calls those that are out of Islam. As for \u2018they call him to hellfire\u2019, then it is another evidence of that, for the polytheists in Makkah attempted to bring him back to their religion, which is hellfire. If someone were to say, \u2018That <em>fitna<\/em> was during the early days of Islam, and he said, \u2018they call him,\u2019 in future tense.\u2019 This is responded to by saying, \u2018The Arabs may refer to the past by speaking in future tense.\u2019 So, \u2018To call them to Allah,\u2019 is about Ammar\u2019s known times in Makkah, and he (peace be upon him) spoke of this because of the intensity of Ammar in lifting the bricks was like the intensity in the times in Makkah and his patience while being tortured, and this is a merit for Ammar and a sign of his patience and strength for the sake of Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be aware that Ibn Battal did not go on to explain the meaning of \u201cthe transgressive group\u201d, and that is due to a reason that has been hidden for many, and it is because this line is not in Saheeh Al-Bukhari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Hajar said: \u201cIt is possible that what is meant by \u2018call him to hellfire\u2019 are the disbelievers of Quraish, as stated by some commentators, however, the addition in Ibn Al-Sakan\u2019s, Kareema\u2019s, and Al-Saghaani\u2019s copy, which he checked with Al-Firabri\u2019s, clarifies that it is referring to his killers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can understand from Ibn Hajar here that the inclusion of both statements in Al-Bukhari is enough to hold the view that these two are connected, but there is an issue with this conclusion, which is that they were definitely not said by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 at one occasion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The First Evidence: The Combining of both Terms cannot be found in Any Other Paths Except this one<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hadith: \u201cHe will be killed by the transgressive group\u201d is authentic and <em>mutawatir<\/em> from a group of companions, and has been narrated from:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Um Salama<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Abu Huraira<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Amr bin Al-Aas<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Mu\u2019awiyah<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- Khuzaimah bin Thabit<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- Abu Qatada<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- Ali<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- Huthaifa<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10- Amr bin Hazm<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11- Abu Ayoob<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">12- Zaid bin Abi Awfa<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">13- Abu Al-Yasr<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">14- Anas<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">15- Ammar<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">16- Uthman<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">17- Abu Mas\u2019ud<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">18- Ibn Abbas<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">19- Abu Rafi\u2019<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">20- Jabir bin Abdullah<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">21- Jabir bin Samura<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">22- Ibn Mas\u2019ud<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">23- Ka\u2019b bin Malik<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">24- Abu Umama<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">25- A\u2019isha<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">26- Usama bin Shareek<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And <strong>NONE<\/strong> of these narrations include the statement: \u201cHe calls them to heaven and they call him to hellfire\u201d. Is it possible for all these people to simply narrate one portion of the narration and leave the rest?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps even more surprising is the narration in Saheeh Muslim through the path of <strong>Abi Nadhra<\/strong> from Abi Sa\u2019eed (#5192) that does not include: \u201cHe calls them to heaven and they call him to hellfire\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An additional piece of evidence against the combining of both terms is in Imam Ahmad\u2019s Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahaba (1546) through an authentic chain from Mujahid but disconnected from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 that he said: \u201cWoe onto Ammar, he calls them to heaven and they call him to hellfire, and that is the way of the wicked.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for Mujahid, not combining \u201che will be killed by the transgressive group\u201d with the other first statement is evidence that this is how he heard it, and Mujahid did not fall into a mistake of combining the two statements.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Second Evidence: Abu Sa\u2019eed\u2019s admittance that he did not hear the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 say: \u201cHe will be killed by the transgressive group.\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad (#10588) from Ibn Abi Adi, from Dawud, from Abi Nadhra, from Abi Sa\u2019eed that he said: My companions narrated to me, and I did not hear it from the Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , that he wiped his head and said: \u201cWoe onto you Ibn Sumayya (Ammar), you will be killed by the transgressive group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is clear proof that Abu Sa\u2019eed did not hear this statement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Saheeh Muslim (#5192) Abu Sa\u2019eed mentions the same hadith while saying, \u201cI was told by he who is better than me, Abu Qatada.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did these two narrations get combined though?!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That is the first question that will come to the mind of the reader after reading the above. In reality, these two narrations were not combined in Saheeh Al-Bukhari. As stated previously, the term \u201che will be killed by the transgressive group\u201d was not explained by Ibn Battal because it wasn\u2019t in his copy of the Saheeh.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2958\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2958\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/20160116_120056-e1452936711877.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2958\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/20160116_120056-e1452936711877-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Copy of a modern Saheeh Al-Bukhari with brackets around &quot;he will be killed by the transgressive sect&quot;.

The same was said by Abu Mas\u2019ud too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Nu\u2019aym Al-Hadded mentioned it in his <em>mustakhraj<\/em> 4\/467 through Abdulaziz bin Al-Mukhtar from Khalid without adding: \u201che will be killed by the transgressive group\u201d. He then included this addition without a chain, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Al-Bukhari included this statement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add: This is explicit evidence from Abu Nu\u2019aym that Al-Bukhari was not the only person to narrate it in this manner.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Bayhaqi stated in his Dala\u2019il Al-Nubuwa 2\/548 that it isn\u2019t in Saheeh Al-Bukhari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Al-Muhib Al-Samit said in Tarteeb Musnad Ahmad p. 354 after mentioning the paths of Al-Bukhari: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t include \u2018he will be killed by the transgressive group.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Thahabi said in his Tareekh: Al-Bukhari mentioned it without: \u201cHe will be killed by the transgressive group\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Qastalani mentioned in Al-Irshad that this statement cannot be found in Abu Thar Al-Harawi\u2019s copy of Saheeh Al-Bukhari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These statements from these scholars contradict the opinion of Ibn Hajar, and there is no doubt that they have seen copies of Saheeh Al-Bukhari with the additions, but rejected that it was included by Al-Bukhari himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, one should know that these statements were combined in other sources, other than Al-Bukhari. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in his Dala\u2019il 2\/547 with a chain from Abdulaziz bin Al-Mukhtar from Khalid Al-Hathaa\u2019, and he stated that this is how others have narrated from Khalid Al-Hathaa\u2019.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (#10740) narrated from Ghundar, from Shu\u2019ba, from Khalid, the same narration, without: \u201che calls them to heaven and they call him to hellfire.\u201d Al-Hakim narrated in Al-Mustadrak (#2605) in the same way from Abdulaziz bin Al-Mukhtar from Khalid, and Al-Bayhaqi in his Dala\u2019il 2\/547 too, with an authentic chain from Abdulwahab from Khalid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We understand from the above that this narration came to us from Khalid Al-Hathaa\u2019 in three variations; with the first statement on its own, with the second on its own, and with both statements together. It is clear that the confusion here is from Khalid himself. However, it was copyist errors that allowed the combining of both variations into Saheeh Al-Bukhari, when Al-Bukhari only included one statement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, we can tell from the above that the narration speaks of the reality of the time. Ammar did not call Mu\u2019awiyah or the \u201ctransgressive group\u201d to heaven, nor did Mu\u2019awiyah call Ammar to hellfire. Rather, Ammar called the disbelievers to heaven and they called him to the hellfire. There is no evidence at all that what is meant by the \u201ccallers of hellfire\u201d is the \u201ctransgressive group\u201d other than the combining of both terms in this one single hadith, and this article has clarified that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 said these two statements at different times.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And praise be to Allah the most gracious and most merciful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem The narration: \u201cWoe onto Ammar, he will be killed by the transgressive group,\u201d is a narration that has been graded as Mutawatir by the people of knowledge.
