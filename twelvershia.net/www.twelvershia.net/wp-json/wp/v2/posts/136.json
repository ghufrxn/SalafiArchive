The narration is not, in any way, contradictory to what RTS quotes in Al-Kafi in his article. Nor does the narration state that he woke up after the Fajr (sunrise) period. On the contrary, in one narration in Saheeh Al-Bukhari, we find the exact timing being determined, it states:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0631\u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u062c\u0646\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0644\u0647 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u063a\u062a\u0633\u0644 \u0648\u064a\u0635\u0648\u0645<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The (time of) Fajr would come upon him, while he was in a state of Janaba due to his family (his wives), he would bathe, and fast. (Saheeh Al-Bukhari, p. 309, Dar Alsalam, 1419, 2<sup>nd<\/sup> edition)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS also says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A&#8217;isha has ascribed a lie to the holy Prophet (saw) by suggesting he would waken in that state which could me either two things:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> A) The Prophet (saw) was fasting read mourning prayers (At this point his fast was closed) then broke his fast by intentionally sleepin with his wive(s) then later performing Ghusul which would mean the Prophet (saw) broke his fast!?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> or<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> B) The Prophet (saw) would miss night Prayers and Mourning prayers awake in the mourning in the state of Janub then performed Ghusul in the morning?!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A third possibility that wasn\u2019t included by RTS is that he could have had sexual intercourse after his night prayers, then woke up and bathed at sunrise.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also strange that RTS quotes this narration, which is also attributed to Um Salama, but then states that it is a fabrication by the brother of A\u2019isha. RTS argues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In one tradition the brother of A&#8217;isha (la) seek to include Umma Salmah (r.a) as a narrator.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, firstly, the brother of A\u2019isha is nowhere to be found. The event is narrated by Abdulrahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham, whose full name is found in the narration itself. It is possible that RTS confused this narrator with Abdulrahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Siddeeq, A\u2019isha\u2019s brother. Either way, Abdulrahman is not the sole narrator of this narration from Um Salama, others have narrated the same from her, like Sulaiman bin Yassar (Saheeh Muslim, p. 496, Dar Al-Ma\u2019rifah, 2007, 2<sup>nd<\/sup> edition) Nafi\u2019 (Sunan Ibn Majah, p. 243, Daralsalam, 1420, First edition), and Amir, the brother of Um Salama. (See Musnad Ahmad, 28\/287, Dar Al-Hadith, 1416, First edition.) Each and every single one of these narrations is authentic, of course.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, this narration is not specific to A\u2019isha, and was also narrated by Um Salama, who the Shias hold in a positive light.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This is a response to the article by RevisitingTheSalaf.org entitled: The Prophet (saw) Would Indulge Himself In Romantic Pursuits While Fasting, which was published on the 29th of January, 2012, which can be read here.
