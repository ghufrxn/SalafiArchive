In this article, we will take a look at the actions of Habeeb bin Al-Muthahir, Zuhair bin Al-Qain, Yazeed bin Al-Muthahir, Nafi\u2019 bin Hilal, a man from the tribe of Kalb, Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel bin Abi Talib, Awn bin Abdullah bin J&#8217;afar bin Abi Talib, a man from the tribe of Ghifar, Al-Hur bin Yazeed, Al-Qasim bin Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, and their actions at the battle of Karbala.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like our previous articles on the actions of Muslim bin Ali, Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas, Ali Al-Akbar, and their actions at the battle of Karbala, we will be comparing two books that have been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya. The first book is the original and accurate rendition of Abi Mikhnaf\u2019s book on the battle of Karbala, while the second is a forgery that has been attributed by him.

(See p. 99)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B (p. 118) includes the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAbu Mikhnaf said: Then Umar bin Sa\u2019ad (la) gathered his troops in right and left flanks. He placed Al-Shimr bin Thi Al-Jawshan (la) on the right with 20,000 knights, and Khawli bin Yazeed Al-Asbahi (la) on the left with 20,000 knights.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In total, the number of the army of Umar bin Sa\u2019ad was 80,000 knights. (Refer to p. 97.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Habeeb bin Al-Muthahir<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Version A of his actions in the battle of Karbala (p. 131-132), we find Abu Mikhnaf saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHu\u1e63ain bin Tameem then attacked them and Habeeb bin Muthahir came forth to him. He (Habeeb) struck his horse\u2019s face with his sword, which caused it to raise both legs from the ground and he (Hu\u1e63ain bin Tameem) fell. His companions came to him and dragged him away.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Habeeb then recited:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we were high in number \u2013 Or half of you then you would have fled \u2013 Ye worst of men in lineage<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also recited on that day:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am Habeeb and my father is Muthahir \u2013 A knight of war and a flaming war<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are more prepared and more in number \u2013 We are more loyal and more patience<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are upon truth and clarity \u2013 We are more fearful (of Allah) than you and excusable<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then fought fiercely. A man from Bani Tameem then came up to him and struck him on his head and killed him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Version B (p. 124) we find him reciting a very similar set of poetry. However, after reciting it, we find him doing the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe then attacked Al-Hu\u1e63ain (bin Tameem), struck him on his head, and cut off his horse\u2019s nose, causing it to fall. He then attempted to go for his head. However, his (Ibn Tameem\u2019s) companions came to his rescue. Then a man from Bani Tameem came and killed him, but he (Habeeb bin Muthahir) continued fighting until he killed thirty-five knights. However, they were too much for him, and they killed him.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Zuhair bin Al-Qain<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not much is known about the final moments of Zuhair bin Al-Qain at the battle of Karbala in Version A (p. 133). Abu Mikhnaf reports:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe (Al-Hur) and Zuhair bin Al-Qain fought together fiercely, and if one got exhausted, the other would help him out, and they did that for a while.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following verse of poetry is also attributed to him:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI am Zuhair and I am Ibn Al-Qain \u2013 I protect with my sword Al-Hussain\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also would hold Al-Hussain\u2019s shoulder and recited:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMove on forth guiding and guided \u2013 For today you meet your grandfather the Prophet<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Al-Hasan and Ali Al-Murtadha \u2013 And the young man with two wings<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And the lion of Allah the martyr\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B of Zuhair bin Al-Qain\u2019s actions at the battle of Karbala are a lot more dramatic. Abu Mikhnaf reports (p.126):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe attacked the men and kept on attacking until he killed fifty knights. Though, he feared that the time of prayer would pass by him, so he returned to Al-Hussain and said, \u2018My Mawla I fear missing the prayer, so please lead us in prayer.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, after rallying the troops and reciting the poetry that has been attributed to him in Version A (with some variances), he attacks and kills seventy more knights.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Yazeed bin Al-Muhasir<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very little is known about Yazeed bin Al-Musahir. Abu Mikhnaf in Version A (p. 138) records:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI am Yazeed and my father is Musahir \u2013 Braver than a lion in a filled forest<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My Lord, I will bring victory to Al-Hussain \u2013 and I will turn my back to Ibn Sa\u2019ad\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yazeed bin Ziyad bin Al-Muhasir was one of those that came out with Umar bin Sa\u2019ad to (fight) Al-Hussain. Though, when they rejected Al-Hussain\u2019s conditions, he joined him, then fought until he was killed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B of the report of Yazeed bin Al-Musahir adds a couple of more lines of poetry. It also refers to him as Yazeed bin Al-Muthahir and not Al-Musahir. Abu Mikhnaf (p. 129) allegedly says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe then attacks the men and continued to attack until his kills fifty knights. They he was killed, may Allah be satisfied with him.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nafi\u2019 bin Hilal Al-Jamali<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nafi\u2019 bin Hilal Al-Jamali\u2019s actions in the battle of Karbala were documented in Version A as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cNafi\u2019 bin Hilal fought on that day and would shout: \u2018I am Al-Jamali. I am upon the religion of Ali.\u2019 Then, a man named Muzahim bin Huraith came out to him and said: \u2018I am upon the religion of Uthman.\u2019 He (Nafi\u2019) replied: \u2018You are upon the religion of the devil.\u2019 He (Nafi\u2019) attacked him and killed him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B though refers to him as Hilal bin Nafi\u2019 Al-Bajali. The narration states that: \u201cHe was raised by the Commander of the Believers and used to me an archer. He would write his name on the arrows and shoot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration continues: \u201cHe then fought the men and killed them, defeating their heroes, and continued to kill until he killed seventy knights. He was then killed, may Allah have mercy upon him.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel bin Abi Talib<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version A of what occurred to Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel is a very summarized one. Abu Mikhnaf (p. 140) only states:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAmr bin Subaih Al-Sadda\u2019I shot an arrow at Abdullah bin Muslim bin Aqeel, which caused his palm to stuck on his head. He was then unable to move his hand. He (Amr) then shot him with another arrow into the heart. They were then attacked by men from all sides.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for version B, it includes several lines of poetry attributed to Abdullah bin Muslim in which he praises Bani Hashim, Al-Hussain, and his bravery. It then includes (p. 137):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHe then attacked them and continued fighting until he killed ninety men. Then an accursed man shot him with an arrow in the head.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Awn bin Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar bin Abi Talib<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version A of Awn bin Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar\u2019s actions at the battle of Karbala was originally short. The narration (p. 140) states nothing more other than Abdullah bin Qutba bin Al-Ta\u2019ee Al-Nabhani attacking Awn bin Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar and killing him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B is somewhat lengthier due to the attribution of the following poetry (p. 138). The narration then continues by stating that he attacked the men and continued to attack until he killed eighty knights. Then he was killed.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Man from the Tribe of Ghifar<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version A (p. 134) of the report states that two men, Abdullah and Abdulrahman, the sons of Azra Al-Ghifari, came to Al-Hussain. They said to him: We wish to be killed in front of you by protecting you. Al-Hussain accepted them and allowed them to fight beside him. One of them began to recite poetry in praise of their bravery and their tribe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B (p. 138-140) uses similar poetry with some variances, though it only speaks of one man and not two. The narration refers to him as Jabir bin Urwa Al-Ghifari and it states that he was an old man that witnessed the battle of Badr with the Messenger \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , as well as other battles. The narration describes him of one that has long eyebrows and that he had to push them away from his eyes. However, this didn\u2019t prevent him from killing eighty men at the battle of Karbala.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Hur bin Yazeed<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version A of Al-Hur bin Yazeed\u2019s actions at the battle of Karbala includes his attempts to reason with the army. It also includes (p. 126) him reciting the poetry of the Jahili poet Antara and that he was victorious in a duel. It also includes (p. 133) more poetry from him later on within the battle, as well as his partnership with Zuhair bin Al-Qain in the midst of battle, as we have included above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version B of Abi Mikhnaf\u2019s report is a lot more detailed. It starts off (p. 146) with Al-Hur approaching Al-Hussain and asking him permission to enter battle, and to die for Al-Hussain. He then recites several lines of poetry before throwing himself in the midst of his enemies. He then defeats their heroes and kills a hundred knights before returning to Al-Hussain. He then recites some more poetry and curses the people of Kufa for betraying Al-Hussain and preventing him from drinking water, while allowing Jews, Christians, dogs, and pigs. He then recites some more poetry (p. 150) before killing another eighty or so knights. Umar bin Sa\u2019ad then ordered his men to shoot arrows at him. They do as they are told, and he is filled with arrows, until he looks like a hedgehog, as the narration says. They then took him in as a prisoner of war, but cut off his head and tossed it to Al-Hussain.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Qasim bin Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Version A (p. 141) of the report depicts Al-Qasim bin Al-Hasan as a weak young man that is attacked by Amr bin Sa\u2019ad bin Nufail Al-Azdi. He is struck on the head and immediately falls to the ground while calling out his uncle Al-Hussain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Version B, of the report (p. 152) makes him out to be quite the warrior, as it includes that he was able to kill seventy knights. However, he is ambushed by an accursed man who strikes him on the head, and thus, his actions at the battle of Karbala come to an end.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above mentioned points are but a few of the exaggerations that we find in <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/10\/24\/history-karbala-study-sources\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Version B<\/a> of the battle of Karbala. We purposefully did not include all what we deem to be fabrications in order to not cause this article to be too large in length. For more material similar to this, again, refer to our articles on Muslim bin Aqeel bin Abi Talib, Ali Al-Akbar bin Al-Hussain bin Abi Talib, and Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas bin Ali bin Abi Talib.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May Allah punish those that have fabricated these <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/01\/29\/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">tales<\/a>.
