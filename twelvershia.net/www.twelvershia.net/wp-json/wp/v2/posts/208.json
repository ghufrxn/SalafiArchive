Yet, if his blood was permissible, like the disbeliever or the apostate or the adulterer, and one has the ability to kill him, before his repentance, then he is like the Mayta (dead food that wasn\u2019t killed), and can be eaten because his blood is Halal.

It is against human nature and the body of the dead needs to be respected whether Muslim or not, so one should refrain from doing so even if he risks dying of starvation as a result.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- In the case of dire need, when a Muslim fears for his life if he did not eat, it is allowed to consume the meat of any dead non-Muslim you can find laying around, its ruling would be the same as the ruling of the Maytah (dead animal). If the Muslim is accompanied by an enemy (such as an enemy soldier), or by a criminal (a man\u00a0deserving\u00a0of the death penalty in Islamic law) then it is permitted to kill him and eat from his meat in extreme cases when the Muslim&#8217;s life is in danger. It is not permissible to eat the meat of a dead Muslim as respect for its sanctity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- In case of dire need, one is able to consume the meat of any dead Muslim or non-Muslim laying about, it will have the ruling of eating the meat of a dead animal (Maytah), and all that is prohibited will become permissible in times of extreme need.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">source:<\/span> &#8220;Abhaath Hay&#8217;at Kibar al-`Ulama'&#8221; volume 2, 1425 hijri, by The general presidency of scholarly research and Ifta in Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to the article on RevisitingtheSalaf.org entitled: They\u2019re Coming to Get You\u2026 The article was published on the 31st of March, 2012, and can be found here.
