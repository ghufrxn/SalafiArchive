When she would meet Holy Prophet (asws), He would stand up, kiss her, and make her sit at his place. And When Holy Prophet (asws) would meet her, She would stand up, kiss him and make him sit at her place. When Prophet (asws) got ill, She met him, and fell on him, and then raised her head and cried, then fell on him, raised her head again, and laughed. I used to think she is the most intelligent in women, but she was a women. When HE died, I asked her that I had seen you laying on him, raising head and crying; and then laying on him, raising head and laughing; what made You do this? She replied that Holy Prophet (asws) had told her that He would die in this illness, so She cried; and then He told her that She would be the first of AhluBait to meet Him, so She laughed\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA comments:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> \u201cSo, We see that there was a particular reason for the way Bibi Fatima (asws) behaved, but Ayesha doubted her intellect without asking her the reason at that time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I respond:<br \/>\n\u201cDoubted her intellect?\u201d What does that even mean? Is that a suggestion that A\u2019isha believed that Fatima was mentally deficient? The correct criticism towards A\u2019isha is that she referred to Fatima as \u201ca woman\u201d, since she believed that Fatima\u2019s emotions were getting the best of her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThis is a desperate attempt by the Shias to defame A\u2019isha and her position towards Fatima. Is it not enough for the Shias to find A\u2019isha claiming that there is nothing who is similar in her habits to the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 than Fatima? Is it not enough for the Shias to find A\u2019isha narrating that Fatima is the mistress of the believers of paradise as per Saheeh Muslim #4488?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to Karbalai Hussainiyya\u2019s (translated by SlaveOfAhlubait) \u201cAyesha doubting the Intellect of Bibi Fatima (a.s)?\u201d The article can be found on SoA\u2019s blog and the Wilayat website.
