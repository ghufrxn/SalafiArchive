Nevertheless, the existence of these schools gives rise to a serious problem that casts doubt on the authority of Twelver hadith collections. I like to call this problem &#8220;The Zaidi Dilemma&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">The Zaidi Dilemma<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When debating Sunnis, Twelver polemicists often argue for the superiority of their hadith sources on the basis that their collections are transmitted through\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait<\/em>. Such appeals stem from the Shi&#8217;ite presupposition that the Prophet&#8217;s family members are superior interpreters and transmitters of Islam. Nevertheless, this claim may ironically end up undermining the reliability of Twelver hadith sources.<\/p>\n<p>Why is that the case?<\/p>\n<p>The problem faced by the Twelver sect is the fact that the Zaidi school also is a claimant to\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait&#8217;s<\/em>\u00a0legacy. Zaidis similarly possess their own hadith collections that consist of reports ascribed to\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait. <\/em>These collections, however, present a vastly different religious narrative than that of the Twelver sect. Since the beliefs of both schools are mutually exclusive in multiple regards, there are only 3 possibilities behind this phenomenon:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Zaidi school is representative of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait&#8217;s\u00a0<\/em>teachings.<\/li>\n<li>The Twelver school is representative of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait&#8217;s\u00a0<\/em>teachings.<\/li>\n<li>None of them are representative of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait&#8217;s\u00a0<\/em>teachings.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The observer is thus able to observe how arbitrary many of these claims to\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait\u00a0<\/em>truly are, especially when one takes into account the tens of other extinct schools that made the exact same claim.<\/p>\n<p>Asides from weightless appeals to authority, the Twelver polemicist, in reality, has no actual reason to dismiss Zaidi hadith sources. When inviting Sunnis to accept Twelver hadith sources, Twelver polemicists will often cite hadiths on the virtues of &#8216;Ali and <em>Ahlulbait<\/em>, such as Hadith Al-Thaqalayn and Hadith Al-Kisaa&#8217;. The ultimate aim of such appeals is to substantiate the validity of the Twelver hadith corpus, which is allegedly based on transmission from <em>Ahlulbait<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>These appeals don&#8217;t actually substantiate the reliability of Twelver sources. This reality becomes apparent when a Twelver makes these appeals with a Zaidi. The Zaidi, unlike the Sunni, already believes in the\u00a0<em>Imamah<\/em> of &#8216;Ali and his superiority to all companions of the Prophet.<em>\u00a0<\/em>He also believes in the superiority of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait.<\/em>\u00a0Thus, the usual Twelver appeal to substantiate the authority of Twelver sources is absolutely worthless in this context. The Zaidi can, in fact, redirect all of these appeals back to the Twelvers and argue for the authority of Zaidi hadith collections.<\/p>\n<p>Zaidi sources may actually prove to be more reliable claimants to the legacy of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait\u00a0<\/em>than Twelver Sources.<\/p>\n<h2>A List of Zaidi Hadith Collections<\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1.

Ironically, &#8216;Amr was declared to be a reliable transmitter of hadith by Twelver authorities (Al-Khoei 14:103). Thus, the collection is further binding upon Twelvers. This becomes even more apparent when one recognizes that Musnad Zaid predates all Twelver hadith collections as well. The Sunnis, on the other hand, are not bound by this text, as its author was identified as a forger in Sunni biographical sources.

It should be noted that the authors of many Zaidi hadith collections actually were from\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait<\/em>, unlike the authors of Twelver collections.

That claim, however, is challenged with the presence of Zaidi hadith collections, which similarly claim to inherit the legacy of\u00a0<em>Ahulbait<\/em>. The Twelver, in reality, has no objective reason to dismiss Zaidi hadith sources. In fact, there are several indicators that may allow one to argue that Zaidi hadith collections are generally more reliable than Twelver hadith collections.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, &#8220;The Zaidi Dilemma&#8221; is a problem that is yet to be solved by Twelver polemicists. This dilemma, along with a plethora of other arguments and observations, further demonstrates the defective nature of the Twelver hadith corpus. It is unfortunate that some Muslims will still hold onto these problematic sources after being made aware of their defective nature.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>They have no knowledge therein.
