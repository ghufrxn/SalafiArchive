It is not a common act for one to speak of their own faults, and in this narration, A\u2019isha confesses that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 reprimanded her for backbiting.<\/p>\n<p>We do not find any other narrations in which A\u2019isha backbites others, so one cannot say that this was her nature. We also do not find others narrating similar events, which leads us to the conclusion that if A\u2019isha never admitting that she sinned, then it would not have been known.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to keep in mind that narration illustrates an A\u2019isha that is in her later years, perhaps in her fifties or sixties, who is looking back at her actions as a teenager, and sharing the words of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 as a lesson to all, while using herself as an example of the culprit.<\/p>\n<p>For more on the merits of A\u2019isha, refer to our article: The Praise of pro-Ali Companions for A\u2019isha.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s \u201cayesha mocking others: sahih sanad\u201d.
