Yet, there is nothing in the text that indicates the permissibility of this action. The quote describes the validness of the pilgrimage of someone that performs such an action, and the scholar here is suggesting that the pilgrimage would only be invalid if there was direct contact between the sexual organs of the female and the male organ. The cloth prohibits direct contact, heat, and enjoyment, and thus, this is not considered to be proper sex.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scholar is not saying that such an act is permissible, but rather, that it doesn\u2019t break one\u2019s pilgrimage, since it is not considered proper intercourse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, some major Shia scholars like Al-Hilli share a similar opinion.
