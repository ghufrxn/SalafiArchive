According to historical facts, Sahlah only had one child with Aboo Hudhayfah who was called Muhammad ibn Abi Hudayfah, born during their stay in Abyssinia. After migration in the 5 A.H. The couple later returned to Makkah around a month later, the same year they remained there until the Prophets (saw) emigration to Madinah eight years later. The occurrence of the breast-feeding event as reported, took place in Madinah, which means\u00a0there was a gap of around 8-10 years between the birth of Sahlah&#8217;s child and her breast-feeding Salim. Normally a woman may continue to secrete milk for a few years after childbirth. This being so, it would be impossible for Sahlah to have been lactating at the time that she was\u00a0supposed to have breast-fed Salim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2355\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no evidence that Abu Hudhayfah had no children other than Muhammad.

The Saheeh Muslim, which is from the narration of Malik, shows no indication of verses of the Qur\u2019an being lost, and that a goat ate some scripture that was already abrogated in the past. The narration found in Muslim is supported by other narrations that include the same meaning about the abrogation of the verse about suckling ten times, and these have come through the paths of Sulayman bin Bilal (in Muslim) and Hamaad bin Salama (Sunan Ibn Majah). Each one of these three men are more trustworthy than Ibn Ishaaq if taken individually, and therefore, their narrations combined make it more certain for us to declare that Ibn Ishaaq erred in this narration.<\/p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2449\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues by collecting more quotes, then mistranslating them:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2452\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2457\">Ibn Hazim:<\/b><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b>Narrated A&#8217;isha: &#8220;The verse of stoning and of suckling an adult ten times was revealed, and they were (written) on a paper and kept under my pillow.

The said author is alleging that A&#8217;isha of her own volition breastfed a slave. Our readers should not forget that the tradition under discussion is that set out under the chapter of Saheeh Muslim titled, \u2018Suckling a Young Lad,\u2019 wherein we learn how Salim, a grown bearded man was suckled by Sahla the mother of the household upon the orders of the Prophet (saw), so that he could become her foster son and negotiate his way through her home without the need for the type of rigid rules of contact placed on a non mahram. During the course of commenting on this very tradition, the author\u00a0argues that A&#8217;isha suckled a Ghulam (servant). Umm Salam (r.a) disliked this young boy entering upon the wives of the Prophet (saw). (Source: Saheeh Muslim. Vol. 2, Pg. # 664, H # 29.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2540\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In order to breast-feed, A&#8217;isha would have had to expose her breast, in other words uncover her (Awrah), something which Allah (swt) has clearly made unlawful for the believers. Breast-feeding involves physical contact between two persons; the woman and the child. If the servant of A&#8217;isha had been breast-fed, physical contact would most certainly have taken\u00a0place, breaking yet another Islam&#8217;s ruling.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1374320200648_2548\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We at twelvershia.net, like the rest of Ahl Al-Sunnah only accept reports that include evidence.
