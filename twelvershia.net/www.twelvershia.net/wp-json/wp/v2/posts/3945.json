Believing otherwise is simply preposterous!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So is this verse useless or random? No, this verse is honoring Ibrahim (as) and informing him that instead of being a prophet that leads his own community or tribe, he shall be leading &#8220;the people&#8221; in general. Thus Ibrahim (as) is a leader to be followed by all humanity, this is why in the Qur&#8217;an we are ordered to follow the example of our leader Ibrahim (as) not of Yunus (as) or any other divine guide.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Then be patient for the decision of your Lord, [O Muhammad], and be not like the companion of the fish (Yunus)} [68:48]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The examples are many and we list the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself.} [2:130]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Say, &#8220;Allah has told the truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of the polytheists.&#8221;} [3:95]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate with Allah.} [16:123]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>SOME SHIA ARGUMENTS:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What if Shia argue and claim that all leaders in the Qur&#8217;an are divinely appointed and thus it is the rule and non-appointed leaders cannot be accepted?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia like to argue &#8220;Bring us a verse of the Qur&#8217;an where Imams were not appointed by God.&#8221; To which we counter and say &#8220;Bring us a verse from the Qur&#8217;an where a non-prophet was appointed as Imam&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from the verses talking about evil Imams and the above-mentioned verse of prophet Ibrahim (as) being an Imam. We have the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{We gave him, in excess, <strong>Isaac<\/strong>, and <strong>Jacob<\/strong> (for a grandson); and We made each righteous &#8211;\u00a0and appointed them <strong>Imams<\/strong>\u00a0to guide by Our Command and We revealed to them to do good deeds, and to establish the prayer, and the giving of charity, and they were for Us worshipers.} [21:72-73<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are the only verses that specify by name individuals who were called\u00a0&#8220;Imams&#8221;, what they all have in common is that they were all prophets.
