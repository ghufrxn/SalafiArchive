The allegation that Hadith documentation was banned is one that is often repeated by Shias in order to disregard the Sunni Hadith library. In the following articles, we will examine these claims by studying the strongest Shia books that have supported this theory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, before even presenting these articles, we briefly quote the Shia scholars on their view on what motivated the first three Caliphs to ban the documentation of Hadith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Jalali in his Tadween Al-Sunnah Al-Shareefa (p. 415) states that this was done to \u201chide the prophetic narrations that were evidences of the caliphate of Ali \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 and his <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/11\/22\/ahlul-bait-a-linguistic-term-or-a-shariah-term\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Ahlul bait<\/a> \u2013 peace be upon them \u2013 after the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; .\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also says (p. 421) that \u201cwhat supports our belief about the benefit of prohibiting the documentation of Hadith is to hide the prophetic narrations that point towards the succession of Ali and his Ahlulbayt \u2013 peace be upon them \u2013 is that the leader (i.e. Caliph) did not only prohibit documentation, but also narrating Hadiths and transmitting them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hashim Ma\u2019rouf Al-Hussaini (p. 22) in his Dirasat fi Al-Hadith wa Al-Muhaditheen also states that he could not find for the prohibition of Hadith documentation any reason except \u201cthe spreading of the narrations of the Messenger in praise of Ali and his progeny \u2013 peace be upon them &#8211; .\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Shihristani in his Prohibition of Recording Hadith (p. 57) admits that the view shared above is the view of most Shia authors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above can all be simply refuted with one of the most famous narration that Shias love to quote:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 on the day of Khaibar, \u201cI will give this flag to a man that loves Allah and His messenger, and Allah will bring victory upon his hands.\u201d Omar said, \u201cI never wanted leadership except that day,\u201d He said, \u201cSo I put my head forward since I wanted to be called out,\u201d He said, \u201cAnd the Messenger of Allah \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 called upon Ali bin Abi Talib and gave it to him.\u201d (Saheeh Muslim #6172)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Omar was against the idea of banning narrations for the sake of not sharing the merits of Ahlulbayt as a whole, then he would have not made this major blunder of narrating a merit of Ali that the whole world has come to know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact it was the Shia Imams themselves that insisted on secrecy and kept their narrations hidden as stated in many locations in their books. For example in al-Kafi 2\/242, is a Hadith judged as \u201cHasan kal-Sahih\u201d by Majlisi in \u201cal-Mir\u2019aat\u201d 9\/286:<\/p>\n<p>[From ibn Ri\u2019aab that he heard abu `Abdullah (as) say to abu Baseer: \u201cBy Allah, if I were to find among you three believers who keep my narrations secret, I would not have allowed myself to keep\u00a0my narrations a secret from you.\u201d]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia authors, however, proceeded to discuss these allegations through hundreds of pages, analyzing the evidences for the prohibition of documentation, and then dissecting any narration that could support their views. However, they all failed in proving the key points:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) That Hadith documentation was banned<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">and<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) That the narrating of Hadiths was banned.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below, we list the articles on this subject, categorized in order to make it easier for readers to arrive to the truths that they are searching for:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/02\/abu-bakr-and-the-prohibition-of-documenting-hadiths\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Abu Bakr and the Prohibition of Hadith Documention<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/04\/omar-and-the-prohibition-of-hadith-documentation\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Omar and the Prohibition of Hadith Documentation<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/07\/omar-and-the-prohibition-of-hadith-narration\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Omar and the Prohibition of Narrating Hadiths<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/10\/uthmans-limitations-on-the-narrating-of-hadiths\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Uthman\u2019s Limitations on the Narrating of Hadiths<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/10\/muawiyahs-limitations-on-the-narration-of-hadiths\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Muawiyah\u2019s Limitations on the Narration of Hadiths<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/05\/02\/writing-of-prophetic-narrations-and-knowledge-during-the-days-of-the-companions\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Early Documentation of Hadiths by the Sahabah<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article examines ones of the more dangerous accusations upon the Caliphs of Islam that Muslims have ever known.
