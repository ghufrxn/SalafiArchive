The name Khalid bin Al-Waleed is also synonymous with the title the \u201cSword of Allah\u201d. ShiaPen do not even attempt to provide any refutation to the fact that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) gave this title to Khalid. Ignoring this aspect of his biography is perhaps the best they can do after all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are no doubts that Khalid bin Al-Waleed was given such a title, and this was documented through authentic chains from Anas bin Malik in Al-Bukhari, Abdullah bin Ja\u2019afar in Musnad Ahmad, and Abdullah bin Abi Awfa in Mustadrak Al-Hakim. The hadith was also narrated through Abu Bakr Al-Sideeq and Abu Huraira, as well as through other Tabi\u2019een, but those are weak in strength, and the previous three authentic narrations are sufficient for all Sunnis with an objective heart to accept it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carrying on, in the article published by ShiaPen, we find several accusations pointed towards Khalid bin Al-Waleed. These are accusations of rape, brutality, and general brutality. We have these accusations on one side, in the form of narrations, and on the other side, we have this authentic report from the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam), giving Khalid a most grandiose title. This reason alone is sufficient to cast doubt upon the narrations that ShiaPen has provided. However, Ahl Al-Sunnah are proud of their objectivity, which is why we have taken the time to study these texts in order to come to a more complete conclusion of Khalid bin Al-Waleed\u2019s character.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Accusation #1 \u2013 The Killing of Malik bin Nuwaira<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen state the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">We know that the filthy Nawasib try their best to legitimize the brutal killing of people by their hero Khalid bin al-Walid on the premise that those killed were Murtad (apostates) and the legitimate Shari penalty was exercised on them. We will counter this particular \u2018allegation\u2019 later in the chapter but in case the Nawasib make any attempt to pollute the \u2018past\u2019 of Malik bin Nuwayrah and his brother Mutammim bin Nuwayrah and suggest they were mere common Muslims who (allegedly) became Murtad after the Prophet\u2019s death, we deem it appropriate to shed some light on them. The reality is that both individuals were not common Muslims, but were like all other companions of Holy Prophet (s) who had entered the pale of Islam.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">It would be relevant to mention the Shi\u2019a view of Malik bin Nuwayrah, so that after reading the entire article, all knowledge seekers (amongst both Sunni and Shi\u2019a) can make a more informed conclusion. Ibn Shazan records in Al-Fadael, page 75:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Al-Bara bin Azeb said: When we were sitting with Allah\u2019s Messenger (s) a delegation from Bani Tammim (tribe) came to Him (s). Malik bin Nuwayra said: \u2018Oh Allah\u2019s Messenger, teach me faith (Iman). Allah\u2019s Messenger said: \u2018To testify that there is no god but Allah only, and I\u2019m the messenger of Allah, pray the five prayers, fast during the month of Ramdhan, pay Zakat, perform pilgrimage to (Allah\u2019s) house, and follow my Wasi after me, and he (prophet) pointed his hand to Ali. And don\u2019t shed blood, don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t betray, don\u2019t eat orphan\u2019s money, don\u2019t drink alcohol and follow my laws, permit what is lawful and forbid what is unlawful, give the rights from your own self to the poor and strong, to the old and young. Till (the prophet) mentioned to him the Islamic laws. (Malik) said: \u2018Oh Allah\u2019s messenger, I\u2019m a man who quickly forgets, please repeat again\u2019. Then He (s) repeated, then he (Malik) left pulling his cloth and saying: \u2018By the God of the house, I learnt faith (Iman).\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">When he (Malik) went far away from Allah\u2019s messenger, He (s) said: \u2018Who ever wants to see a man of heaven, he should look at this man.\u2019 Abu Bakr and Umar said: \u2018Oh Allah\u2019s messenger, who are you referring to?\u2019 He (s) looked down to the earth, then they (Abu Bakr &amp; Umar) followed him (Malik) and said to him: \u2018Good news from Allah and His messenger to you to have been promised Paradise.\u2019 He (Malik) replied: \u2018May Allah bless you if you are testifying by what I testify, because you learnt what Prophet Muhammad taught me. But if you don\u2019t, then may Allah not bless you.\u2019 Abu Bakr said: \u2018Don\u2019t say that, I\u2019m the father of Ayesha, the wife of the prophet.\u2019 He (Malik) said: \u2018What do you want ?\u2019 They (Abu Bakr &amp; Umar) said: \u2018You are from the people of Paradise, so ask for forgiveness for us\u2019. He (Malik) said: \u2018May Allah never forgive you, you leave the Messenger of Allah who owns intercession and ask me for forgiveness!\u2019 Then they returned back and signs of sadness appeared on their faces, when Allah\u2019s Messenger saw them, He smiled and said: \u2018Is their sadness because of truth?\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">When Allah\u2019s Messenger died and Bani Tamim (tribe) returned to Madina with Malik bin Nuwaira being with them, he went to see as to who became the successor after Allah\u2019s messenger, he entered the mosque on Friday and Abu Bakr was giving an address on the pulpit. He (Malik) looked at him and said: \u2018Oh brother of Taim\u2019. (Abu Bakr) said: \u2018Yes\u2019. He (Malik) said: \u2018Where is the Wasi of Allah\u2019s messenger, who ordered I was ordered to follow?\u2019 They (people) said: \u2018Oh you desert Arab, things have changed.\u2019 (Malik) said: \u2018By Allah, nothing has changed, but you betrayed Allah and His messenger.\u2019 Then he (Malik) got closer to Abu Bakr and said: \u2018Who allowed you to climb onto the pulpit while the Wasi of Allah\u2019s Messenger is here?\u2019. Abu Bakr said: \u2018Throw out this desert Arabian who urinates on his heels from Allah\u2019s Messenger mosque.\u2019 Qunfud and Khalid bin al-Walid went to him and kept pushing him until they removed him from the mosque.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Then he (Malik) rode on his camel and said (poem): \u2018We obeyed Allah\u2019s messenger as long he was amongst us, Oh people, what I have to do with Abu Bakr\u2026.\u2019 When every thing was under Abu Bakr\u2019s control, he sent Khalid bin al-Walid and said to him: \u2018You heard what Malik said in front of the people, I\u2019m worried that he would cause a crack we wont be able to fix. Kill him.\u2019 When Khalid arrived (to Malik\u2019s land) he (Malik) rode on his horse and he was a knight equal to thousand knights, hence Khalid was scared of him, therefore he (Khalid) gave him oath, and then when (Malik) dropped his weapon, Khalid betrayed him he killed him, placed his head in a cooking pot, and married his wife the same night, raping her like a donkey.\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Also according to the Shia source al-Estighatha by Abu al-Qasim al-Kufi (d. 352 H), Volume 1 page 7, Malik\u2019s tribe refused to submit Zakat to Abu Bakr because they believed that they were supposed to submit it to Ali bin Abi Talib (as).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond to all of the above with this:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahl Al-Sunnah do not take narrations from liars, let alone late Imami Rafidhi historians.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen continue by providing a narration where in which Khalid purposefully kills Malik while knowing that he is a Muslim:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abdulrazaq \u2013 Mu\u2019amar \u2013 al Zuhari \u2013from- Aba Qutadah said: During Reda (days), we marched to Ahl Abyaat and reached there at sunset, then we raised our spears, hence they asked: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 We replied: \u2018We are slaves of Allah.\u2019 They said: \u2018We are slaves of Allah too.\u2019 Then Khalid arrested them and when it was morning he ordered their beheading. Then I said: \u2018Oh Khalid! Fear Allah, this is not allowed for you.\u2019 He (Khalid) replied: \u2018Stay (back); this is not your business.\u2019 Then Abu Qutadah swore by Allah never to march with Khalid for any war. Qutadah said:\u2018The desert Arabs encouraged him (Khalid) on killing them for the sake of booties and that was Malik bin Nuwayrah\u2019s case.\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Al-Musanaf, Volume 10 page 174 Tradition 18721<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond:<br \/>\nThe narration is disconnected, since Al-Zuhri only heard narrations from the Sahabah that died very late, like Anas bin Malik. Abu Qatada however, died before that by decades, and this is common knowledge to all students of Hadith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen also provide another Hadith in attempt to prove that Malik\u2019s family received some blood money, implying that he is a Muslim:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Ali bin Muhammad \u2013 Abi Daeb \u2013 al-Zuhari \u2013 Salim \u2013 his father that he said: Abu Qutada came to Abu Bakr and informed him of the murder of Malik and his companions, hence he (Abu Bakr) became extremely aggrieved. Abu Bakr then wrote (a message) to Khalid, and he (Khalid) came to him. Abu Bakr said: \u2018Can it be more than Khalid interpreted and made a mistake? Then Abu Bakr sent Khalid back and paid blood money for Malik bin Nuwayrah and returned the booty.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Tarikh Ibn Asakir, Volume 16 page 254<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration is weak since Ibn Abi Dhi\u2019ib is weak in his narration from Al-Zuhri. This is the position stated by Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ali bin Al-Madeeni. See Mizan Al-I\u2019itidal 6\/229.<br \/>\nShiaPen also make the argument that Abu Qatada and other witnessed Malik bin Nuwairah performing prayers, however, this too cannot be found in any authentic chains. See Tareekh Khalifa bin Khayyat p 53.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen then argue that Malik bin Nuwairah made an oath, which implied that he was a Muslim:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Imam Tabarani records the following words of Mutammim in Muajam al-Kabeer, Volume 8 page 294:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abu Khalifa al-Fadhl bin Habab narrated from Muhammad bin Salam al-Jumahi from Abu Ubaida, who said: Dharar bin al-Auwzor the one who killed Malik bin Nuwaira, therefore Mutammim bin Nuwaira said a (poem) in that case condemning Khalid bin al-Walid :\u2026 \u2018you gave him an oath in the name of Allah and then you killed him? Surely if he (Malik) gave you an oath, he would never betray\u2026\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Imam Abi Bakr al-Haythami also recorded this tradition from Tabarani and stated:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cThe narrators are reliable\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Majm\u2019a al-Zawaed, Volume 6 page 222 Tradition 10391<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">These words of Mutammim clearly allude to the fact that prior to the murder of Malik, Khalid and Malik exchanged oaths and that too, in the name of Alah (swt). This proves that Mailk was a Muslim, not a Murtad. Moreover, the condemnation of Khalid by Mutammim also proves the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration is weak since Mohammad bin Salaam Al-Jumahi is from a very late level of narrators and his shaikh, Abu Ubaida, presumably Ma\u2019amar bin Al-Muthana, died around the year 200 AH. So, between him and the events of the narration is a very wide gap, which makes the narration weak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen continue by providing a statement from Ibn Hajar, in an attempt to prove that Malik bin Nuwairah was a companion of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">It is indeed unfortunate that the shameless Nawasib try to excommunicate a Sahabi to cover up the heinous crime committed by their hero Khalid bin al-Walid, backed by the caliph of the time. Now, let us prove Malik bin Nuwayrah\u2019s faith from a different angle and for this, allow us to introduce the father in law of Malik namely al-Minhal al-Tamimi.

He made decisions that contravened those of Abu Bakr, he killed Malik bin Nuwayra and married his wife. He made peace with the people of Yamama and married the daughter of Maj\u2019a bin Marara. These were met with disapproval by Abu Bakr and he issued Diyat (blood money) to Mutammim bin Nuwayrah and ordered Khalid to divorce Malik\u2019s wife\u2026.\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Tarikh Ibn Asakir, Volume 16 page 274<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond:<br \/>\nMus\u2019ab Al-Zubairi died in the year 236 AH, and was not an eye witness of the events, which makes the narration not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen then quote another similar narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abu Bakr al-Ansar from al-Hassan bin Ali from Abu Umar bin Haywiyah from Ahmad bin Maroof from al-Hussain bin al-Fehm from Muhammad bin Saad from Muhammad bin Umar from Muhammad bin Abdullah from al-Zuhari from Handala bin Ali al-Aslami who said: \u2018\u2026When Khalid arrived at Madina, he entered the mosque of Allah\u2019s Messenger wearing rusty armor and with his sword. There were some arrows in his turban, he passed by Umar but didn\u2019t talk to him, then he came to Abu Bakr, and he heard from Abu Bakr what pleased him, he then left happy. Umar therefore knew that Abu Bakr had pleased him, therefore he didn\u2019t talk to him (Khalid).

The follow it up with an accusation that Sunnis have distorted Al-Tabaqat Al-Kubra as well:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Imam of Ahle Sunna Mullah Muttaqi Hindi (d. 975 H) in his famed work Kanz ul Ummal quoted a tradition from the esteemed Sunni work \u2018Tabaqat al Kubra\u2019 by Imam Ibn Saad which was sufficient to unveil the actual role of Khalid in the case of Malik bin Nuwayrah but the Sahabah worshippers could not tolerate this and tampered with \u2018Tabaqat al Kubra\u2019 and removed it. But, the presence of this tradition in Kanz ul Ummal shall make our readers realize why it was essential that the children of Muawiyah delete the primary source. We read the following tradition in Kanz ul Ummal, Volume 5 page 619 Tradition 14091:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Ibn Abi Aun and others narrated that Khalid bin al-Walid claimed that Malik bin Nuwayrah had become Murtad according to the information that he (Khalid) had received. Malik denied this and said: \u2018I am a Muslim, I never changed.\u2019 Abu Qutada and Abdullah ibn Umar testified that (Malik is Muslim) but Khalid ordered Dharar bin Al-Auzwar to behead him (Malik). Then Khalid took his (Malik\u2019s) wife. (Umar) said to Abu Bakr: \u2018He (Khalid) has performed adultery, you have to stone him\u2019. Abu Bakr said: \u2018I can\u2019t stone him; he interpreted hence made a mistake\u2019. (Umar) said: \u2018Then dismiss him\u2019. He (Abu Bakr) said: \u2018I cannot put the sword back in the sheath which Allah has pulled out on my opponents.\u2019(Ibn Sa\u2019ad).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration exists in a separate work called Al-Juz\u2019 Al-Mutamim li Tabaqat Ibn Sa\u2019ad since the older published edition of the book was based on an incomplete manuscript. The narration is #231 and includes Al-Waqidi again, which makes the narration weak.<br \/>\nShiaPen then decide to list the opinions of scholars that supported some of the claims, like Ibn Abd Al-Barr, Al-Zamakhshari, Ibn Katheer, Mohammad bin Salaam Al-Jumahi, Ibn Al-A\u2019atham, and Al-Diyarbakri.<br \/>\nIn response to this, we quote the original article by Ansar.org, who correctly argue:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Sh\u00ee\u2018\u00ee authors have the habit of supplying incidents like this with multiple references. In order to fully convince the uninformed Sunn\u00ee reader, they will quote not only at-Tabar\u00ee as the source for the incident, but also Ibn Kath\u00eer\u2019s al-Bid\u00e2yah wan-Nih\u00e2yah, Ibn al-Ath\u00eer\u2019s al-K\u00e2mil, etc. They conveniently forget that Ibn Kath\u00eer and Ibn al-Ath\u00eer, and like them, most later historians, draw directly from at-Tabar\u00ee, and have stated as much in their respective introductions. It is thus of no benefit to quote them as separate references, since all they do is quote at-Tabar\u00ee. And as for at-Tabar\u00ee himself, he has never claimed all the material in his huge work to be the truth. On the contrary, he states very clearly in his introduction:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\">Whatever is to be found in this book of mine as quoted from some past source, which the reader finds unacceptable or the hearer deems repugnant for the reason that he does not see any authenticity in it or does not find real meaning in it, let it be known that we are not responsible for it.

We for our part have only reproduced what has been transmitted to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, we provide our final verdict regarding this incident, and it is that there are no authentic reports on this matter. Most of the narrations regarding this matter are disconnected or come to us through the report of Al-Waqidi the liar. It is due to this that we find Khalid bin Al-Waleed innocent of the accusations regarding the killing of Malik bin Nuwairah. We furthermore add that we do not believe that Malik bin Nuwairah died as a Muslim, for if this was the case, then he would have been at least included in the earlier books that list the names of the companions. The main four books in the field are the ones that Ibn Al-Atheer based his book Usd Al-Ghaba upon, which are the works of Ibn Mandah, Abu Nu\u2019aim, Ibn Abd Al-Barr, and Ibn Al-Madeeni, and yet, none of them mentioned him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Al-Atheer, was left confused by this (see 4\/178), he named him as one of the Arabs who renegated from Islam alongside Musaylamah al-Kazzab in the bio of Khalid, then mentioned that some people said that he died a Muslim after hinting towards the reports we dealt with above, he also does the same \u00a0in the bio of ibn Nuwayrah, but it is obvious, when studying the evidences, that there is no authentic proof that Malik bin Nuwairah died as a Muslim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Accusation #2: Khalid Legitimizes his Junior Officer\u2019s Rape of a Woman Captured in War.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Imam Bayhaqi records the following incident involving the two best mates, Khalid bin Walid and Dharar bin al-Auwzwar:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abu al-Hussain bin al-Fadhl al-Qatan narrated from Abdullah bin Jaffar bin Darestweh from Yaqub bin Sufyan from al-Hassab bin Rabee from Abdullah bin al-Mubarak from Kahmas from Harun bin Al-Asam who said: Umar bin al-Khatab may Allah be pleased with him sent Khalid bin al-Walid in an army, hence Khalid sent Dharar bin al-Auwzwar in a squadron and they invaded a district belonging to the tribe of Bani Asad. They then captured a pretty bride, Dharar liked her hence he asked his companions to grant her to him and they did so. He then had sexual intercourse with her, when he completed his mission he felt guilty, and went to Khalid and told him about what he did. Khalid said: \u2018I permit you and made it lawful to you.\u2019 He said: \u2018No not until you write a message to Umar\u2019.

We read in Sahih al Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 628:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Narrated Salim\u2019s father:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the tribe of Jadhima and Khalid invited them to Islam but they could not express themselves by saying, \u201cAslamna (i.e. we have embraced Islam),\u201d but they started saying \u201cSaba\u2019na! Saba\u2019na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another).\u201d Khalid kept on killing (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive. When there came the day then Khalid ordered that each man (i.e. Muslim soldier) should kill his captive, I said, \u201cBy Allah, I will not kill my captive, and none of my companions will kill his captive.\u201d When we reached the Prophet, we mentioned to him the whole story. On that, the Prophet raised both his hands and said twice, \u201cO Allah! I am free from what Khalid has done.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">It should be noted that Khlid was sent by the Prophet (s) to invite people to Islam not to kill them. Despite this Khalid personally killed those he was unable to convince to embrace the faith, and asked his collegues to likewise kill those that they had captured, and on what grounds? Just for fun! Thank god his colleagues adopted sense and opted to ustilise their humanity, and rejected these orders that later on turned out to be the correct decision as the Holy Prophet (s) in automatically distanced himself from the brutality committed by Khalid. Are these the types of acts these Nawasib evidence as the \u2018bravery\u2019 of Khalid? Ofcourse Ansar.Org put this tragedy down to a mere mistake, they state:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">When the news of their execution reached Rasulullah r he lifted his hands and said, \u201cO Allah, I dissociate myself from what Khalid has done.\u201d8 Although Rasulullah r dissociated himself from the haste Khalid made himself guilty of, he did not punish him, since it was an error in judgement on his part. A very regrettable error it was, but it was still an error.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">The reality is this was more than just an error of judgement, it was a calculated cold blooded murder of Muslims, merely to settle some old scores. We shall seek to evidence this through the testimony of the Sahaba themselves\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By going through the narration, we find no evidences that suggest that his actions were a calculated murder. Not only that, but if these actions were calculated, then why did the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) let Khalid bin Al-Waleed continue to lead armies? This is common knowledge found in the books of Seerah and the Saheehain. More specifically, he sent Khalid to Yemen during his last years, way after the incident of Bani Jathima.<br \/>\nShiaPen though, provide the following narration in order to make their theories sound more reasonable:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cAbu Bakr Muhammad bin Abdulbaqi from al-Hassan bin Ali from Abu Umar Muhammad bin Abbas from Abdulwahab bin Abi Haya from Muhammad bin Shuja from Muhammad bin Umar from- Abdullah bin Yazid from Eas bin Salamah narrated from his father that when Khalid bin al-Walid came to the Prophet (s) after what he had done to the tribe of Jadhima, Abdurrahman bin Auf discredited Khalid on his deed and said: \u2018Oh Khalid, you adopted the manner of Jahiliyah and killed them to avenge your uncle al-Fakeh, may Allah curse you.\u2019 Then Umar bin al-Khatab supported him against Khalid. Khalid said: \u2018I avenged your father.\u2019 Abdulrahman ibn Auf said: \u2018By Allah, you have lied, I killed the killer of my father with my own hands and Uthman bin Affan is witness to that\u2019. Then he (Abdulrahman) looked at Uthman and said to him: \u2018I appeal to you by Allah, do you witness that I killed my father\u2019s killer?\u2019 Uthman said: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Then Abdulrahman said: \u2018Oh Khalid, shame on you, even if I didn\u2019t kill the killer of my father, would you kill Muslims to take avenge my father?\u2019 Khalid said: \u2018Who told you that they were Muslims!\u2019 (Abdulrahman said): \u2018All the soldiers testify that you saw them building mosques and testifying that they were Muslims, and then you struck them with the sword.\u2019 (Khalid) said: \u2018I had received a message from Allah\u2019s messenger to invade them, therefore I attacked them on the orders of the Prophet (s)\u2019. Abdulrahman said: \u2018You have attributed a lie to Allah\u2019s messenger.\u2019 Then (Khalid) became rude with Abdulrahman and Allah\u2019s Messenger became angry and turned his face from Khalid because of what he did to Abdurrahman\u2026\u201d <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"> Tarikh Ibn Asakir, Volume 16 page 234<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again though, ShiaPen have relied on Al-Waqidi the liar for information, which is why the narration goes against the authentic and logical position of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) that we have provided above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Accusation #6: Khalid bin Al-Waleed Mulatilates Malik bin Nuwairah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Previously we just shed light on the fact that Khalid bin Walid unjustly killed the Sahabi Malik bin Nuwayrah by alleging that he was a Murtad.
