We would like to ask what Abdullah ibn Umar meant by this. Was he implying Allah (swt) and our beloved Prophet (saw) would accept a man like Yazid to be a ruler of the Muslims?\u00a0 Abdullah ibn Umar made a very bold claim\u00a0directed at\u00a0those who went against Yazid\u00a0as being\u00a0faithless and ignorant. According to this theory, what would that make Imam Hussain (a.s) who went out to defend the pure religion of Islam\u00a0against this rapist? Astaghfirullah! Why do we find Sunnis often rejecting such hadith when they are clear as crystal in\u00a0their own books. It may be that\u00a0Sheikh Mumtaz was unaware of the existence of these hadith\u00a0in the Sihah as Sittah and so\u00a0claimed whatever was being narrated as, &#8220;Bogus, Da&#8217;if and Fabricated&#8221; and thus vouched his life against it.

An apostate, on the other hand, is one that is taken out of the fold of Islam and into the hellfire.

When Yahya bin Ma\u2019een was asked if he was trustworthy, he replied, \u201cHow can the killer of Al-Hussain be trustworthy?!\u201d Even though there seems to be a contradiction between the two views, we can reconcile these by stating that the term \u201ctrustworthy\u201d cannot be used for someone who is seen as a <i>fasiq<\/i> (immoral\/unjust). However, there is no evidence that Omar bin Sa\u2019ad ever lied in a narration, which is why some scholars have regarded him as truthful in his narration. This can be seen when we examine the narration that RTS quoted from Musnad Ahmad that Omar bin Sa\u2019ad narrated from his father that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said, \u201cI am amazed by the judgement of Allah upon the believer: If good happened to him, he would thank his Lord, and if evil occurred, he would thank his Lord and be patience, and the believer is always rewarded, even when he raises the food for his wife to eat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first portion of the hadith is the famous hadith of Suhaib Al-Rumi, which can be found in Saheeh Muslim. As for the second part of the hadith about received rewards for feeding one\u2019s wife can be found in the narration of Amir bin Sa\u2019ad from his father in the Saheehain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, Omar bin Sa\u2019ad barely has any narrations.

Sheikh Mumtaz may admit to Yazeed having &#8216;certain elements of responsibility&#8217; but in reality, the drunkard was\u00a0completely and utterly responsible for the killing of Imam Hussain (a.s) and not a single excuse should be of acceptance!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As much as we admire the zeal demonstrated by RTS, we must admit that we do not find evidence in the claims of a ninth century scholar.

It is a well known and established fact that the earlier Sunnis were known as Shi&#8217;as and later adopted the name, &#8216;Ahl ul Sunnah Wal Jamaah.&#8217; According to the Sheikh,\u00a0this is not the case. Let us now prove otherwise as was done in the discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are in agreement with RTS here that the early Shias were mostly members of Ahlulsunnah. There were other groups that fell under the vast umbrella of <i>tashayyu<\/i>, however, those were a minority. In fact, if RTS wanted to argue that no Twelver Al-Hussain then RTS would be correct, since the Twelver faith was not established until the middle of the third century after the death of Al-Hasan Al-Askari.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, what Sh. Mumtaz seemed to be implying is that there were those from the Kufans who were \u201cextreme\u201d in their <i>tashayyu\u00b8<\/i> who held practices that are similar to those that are held by contemporary Shias today, like <i>taqiyyah<\/i>, the ascription of divine attributes for the Imams, and <i>raj\u2019ah<\/i>. People with such beliefs did exist in Kufa. However, as we have said, they were a minority, and shouldn\u2019t hold the full blame for the death of Al-Hussain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>Section 3<\/b><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> We will now show you the references quoted in the discussion pertaining to ibn Abbas advising Imam Hussain (a.s) not to go to Kufa since his (a.s) followers were but\u00a0few and that this move from Makkah\u00a0to Kufa\u00a0was not at all politically motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS is not clear about the significance of this opinion. There is no denial that the intention of receiving support from the people of Kufa implies some sort of political intent though.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the next section of the article, RTS tries something creative:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>Section 4<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Now we come to the issue of the letters received by Imam Hussain (a.s) and whether the letters received were from the Shi&#8217;a of Imam Hussain (a.s) or those who had no regard for the Imam (a.s). While Sheikh Mumtaz denies letters and says they can easily be forged, we shall now see what we have in the books of history and what the scholars have narrated. We find that some of these very letters were written by single individuals, others contained two, three or four signatures, all requesting\u00a0Imam Hussain (a.s)\u00a0to go\u00a0to Kufa\u00a0because they did not have an Imam. Many letters were delivered to him (a.s), so much so that he (a.s) received a total of as many as twelve thousand letters. He (a.s) did not answer any of them. The last letter he received was sent by Shabath ibn Rab&#8217;i, Ijar ibn Abjar, Yazid ibn Al-Harith, Izrah ibn Qays, Amr ibn Al-Hajjaj, and Muhammad ibn Ummayr ibn Utarid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As objective academics, we do not hold the view that those that invited Al-Hussain are his killers. However, we do believe that they let him down. This view is conforms with the Shari\u2019ah as well, since one cannot be put to death for letting someone down, nor is such an action equivalent to murder.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shabath bin Rib\u2019ee is the focus of this section of the article. RTS quotes several statements from the scholars of hadith, in an attempt to show that he was an important hadith narrator. However, RTS has failed to provide any statements from the scholars regarding his reliability. Furthermore, there is only one narration from him in the six books, which can be found in Sunan Abi Dawud in which the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) teaches Ali about a method of <i>tasbeeh<\/i>. The narration itself, from the path of Shabath is weak, since he is not considered reliable, and the narrator from him, Mohammad bin Ka\u2019ab did not hear from him (Al-Bukhari said: We do not know that Mohammad bin Ka\u2019ab heard from Shabath. See Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb). Furthermore, the narration is authentic through other paths, like through Ibn Abi Layla in the Saheehain, and it also narrated by Abu Dawud through Ibn A\u2019abad. So, either way, Ahlulsunnah did not rely on Shabath for his narrations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, RTS\u2019 final argument:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Section 5<\/span><\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> We will now highlight that Sulayman bin Surad was infact a Sahabi who, along with his Shi&#8217;a, failed to\u00a0aid Imam Hussain (a.s) after sending him letters and inviting him (a.s) to Kufa.
