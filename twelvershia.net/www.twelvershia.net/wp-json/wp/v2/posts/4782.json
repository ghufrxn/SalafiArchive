This debate has now become a fundamental aspect of Sunni-Shia polemics. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Abu Hurayrah never participated in a battle against &#8216;Ali, the Shia today seem so adamant about his incrimination as a forger. I thus found myself asking: &#8220;Did the Imams authentically say anything about Abu Hurayrah?&#8221; This question sparked my interest and led me to several surprising conclusions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Imams Said NOTHING About Abu Hurayrah<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As desperate as the Shia are today to prove that Abu Hurayrah was a liar, the Imams are not authentically quoted saying anything about the status of this man as a transmitter of hadith in the Twelver tradition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only two baseless traditions cited by Shi&#8217;ite polemicists today. These traditions, surprisingly, are extremely weak according to Twelver standards, let alone Sunni standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first report is a tradition transmitted by Al-Saduq in <em>Kitab Al-Khisal<\/em>. He said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><span style=\"color:#fc0202\" class=\"color\">Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Ishaq Al-Talqani<\/span> informed us, he said: &#8216;Abdulaziz b. Yahya informed us,  he said: Muhammad b. Zakariyya informed us, from <span style=\"color:#f50606\" class=\"color\">Ja&#8217;far b. Muhammad b. &#8216;Umarah<\/span>, from his <span style=\"color:#fb0202\" class=\"color\">father<\/span>, I heard Ja&#8217;far (as) say:<\/p><p>&#8220;There were three individuals who used to lie upon the Prophet: Abu Hurayrah, Anas b. Malik and a woman.&#8221;<\/p><p><\/p><cite>Al-Khisal pg. 190 <\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This report is extremely weak and worthless for several reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Ishaq is unknown. (Al-Jawaheri 483)<\/li><li>Muhammad b Ibrahim&#8217;s exclusive transmission from &#8216;Abdulaziz b. Yahya.<\/li><li>Ja&#8217;far b. Muhammad b. &#8216;Umarah is unknown.<\/li><li>Ja&#8217;far b. Muhammad b. &#8216;Umarah&#8217;s exclusive transmission from his father<\/li><li>His father, Muhammad b. &#8216;Umarah is unknown as well.<\/li><li>Muhammad b. &#8216;Umarah&#8217;s exclusive transmission from Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This report clearly is not authentic according to Twelver standards: it contains three unknown transmitters who all exclusively transmitted this report at various points in the isnad. Similarly, Muhammad b. Zakriyya b. Dinar was a suspect of forger in the Sunni tradition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next alleged report is not even a hadith. The 5th century Twelver polemicist, Al-Tabari (d. post-411), in his book <em>Al-Mustarshid<\/em>, simply said: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>And the Commander of the faithful said regarding him (Abu Hurayrah): The most prolific of liars upon the Messenger of Allah is this young man from the tribe of Daws (Abu Hurayrah). <\/p><cite>Al-Mustarshid pg. 170<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this report too is a fabrication. Al-Tabari does not list an isnad for it, and there is a 350+ year-long disconnection in its transmission. It is worthless according to Twelver standards, let along Sunni standards of hadith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These literally are the only two texts where the Imams are quoted implicating Abu Hurayrah. Other than these two forgeries, there is not a single authentic quote where one of the Imams is quoted addressing Abu Hurayrah&#8217;s reliability as a transmitter of Prophetic traditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than these two clearly inauthentic reports, Shi&#8217;ite polemicists primarily appeal to fallacious reasoning and dishonest appeals in a desperate attempt to implicate Abu Hurayrah, as we have demonstrated in our article: &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/05\/abu-hurayrah-the-mirage-of-lies\/\">Abu Hurayrah &amp; The Mirage of Lies<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the process, Twelver polemicists similarly uphold a double standard as they attempt to slander and implicate Abu Hurayrah, as we have demonstrated in the following article: &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/26\/shia-double-standards-with-abu-hurayrah\/\">Shia Double Standards with Abu Hurayrah<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is evident that there is not a single authentic text from any of the 12 Imams regarding the status of Abu Hurayrah as a transmitter of hadith. What is further surprising is that Abu Hurayrah never participated in a battle against &#8216;Ali. In fact, Abu Hurayrah transmitted several merits of Ahlulbait, as demonstrated in this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/05\/abu-hurayrah-the-mirage-of-lies\/\">article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality of the matter is that the early Shi&#8217;ite community did not necessarily have a negative view of Abu Hurayrah. Rather, these &#8220;anti-Abu Hurayrah&#8221; sentiments only emerged in the late 2nd century, which explains the incidence of a few Twelver fabrications from this era regarding Abu Hurayrah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who insincerely slander Abu Hurayrah today will one day regret their transgression against this innocent companion of the Prophet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p> And on the Day of Resurrection you shall see those who lied about Allah; their faces are blackened. Is there not an abode in hell for the arrogant? <\/p><cite>Quran 39:60<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"text-align:center\"><u class=\"remove-format\">Sources<\/u><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Jawaheri, Muhammad.&nbsp;<em>Al-Mufid Min Mo\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith<\/em>. 2nd ed., Al-\u2018Ilmiyyah, 1424.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Tabari, Muhammad b.
