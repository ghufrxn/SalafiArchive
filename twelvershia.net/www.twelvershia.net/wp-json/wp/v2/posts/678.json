It was the close companions of the Prophet (saws) such as Abu Bakr (ra) and `Ali (ra) and Bilal (ra) who fought these deserters who changed their faith, which makes it really silly for some modern day Shia to come and claim that it was those close companions who changed and were rejected at the fount.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From\u00a0<a title=\"External link\" href=\"http:\/\/sunnah.com\/muslim\/2\" rel=\"nofollow external\">Saheeh Muslim<\/a>\u00a0we find the Hadiths of Abu Huraira (ra) and Hudhaifa (ra).

If he knew who they were, he wouldn&#8217;t need the indicator of their Islam (i.e. the markings from their ablution). Secondly, it is obvious that this narration is talking about people who left Islam as they would no longer pray and do ablution, so this purity and whiteness that comes from ablution and prayer would disappear from them. There is no mention of `Ali&#8217;s (ra) leadership being the cause as he\u00a0(salalahu alaihi wa salam) would have said something like: &#8220;I would recognize you by your love for `Ali&#8221; or &#8220;Your faces would shine from your deep love and loyalty to `Ali&#8221; or something of this nature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add: This narration shows that the Prophet (saws) does not know what the people of this earth are doing nor does he know their condition, this is why he asks his Lord what they did and the angel replies &#8220;They changed after you&#8221;. It is by consensus of Muslim scholars that any person living in those times who had changed his religion or rejected a fundamental part of Islam like Salat or Zakat has indeed left the folds of Islam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For more on this, refer to:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/02\/14\/response-to-hadeeth-of-lake-fountain\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Response to Hadeeth of Lake-Fountain<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also what confirms that this matter has nothing to do with `Ali&#8217;s Imamah or even the accusation that a certain someone beat-up Fatimah (as), we refer to this clear narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Musnad `Umar by abu Yusuf Ya`qoub al-Hafiz (d. 262h), with an authentic chain from the path of Umm Salamah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\u0641\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0648\u064e\u062f\u064f \u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0631\u064d\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u062b\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0634\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0643\u064c\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0635\u0650\u0645\u064d\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0644\u064d\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0642\u064d\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0651\u0650 \u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064e\u060c \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u062a\u0652: \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 : &#8221; \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u064a \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u062a\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627 &#8221; \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0636\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u0646\u064e\u0634\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064f\u061f \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064f: \u0644\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0651\u0650\u0626\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n[We were told by al-Asawad bin `Amir, he said: Shareek told us, from `Asim, from abi Wa&#8217;il, from Masrouq, from Umm Salamah, she said: The messenger (saw) said: &#8220;From my companions are people I will not meet nor shall they meet me after death.&#8221; So `Umar may Allah be pleased with him came to her and said: &#8220;By Allah I ask of you, am I one of them?&#8221; She said: &#8220;No, and I shall not clear anyone after you.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Hadith is authentic, graded as &#8220;Hasan&#8221; because of Shareek and `Asim, the narration is connected, the only matter one might argue is that Shareek is a Mudallis.
