On the other hand, if he had some feminine softness in his limbs and his tongue, as a result of him being created this way, and he does not desire women, and he is not effeminate in the sense of committing lewd actions, in this case some of our scholars have allowed them to be left with women.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>source: al-Mabsout 12\/382.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mukhannatheen in the Maliki Madhab:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Mukhannath is not necessarily one who is known for lewd acts, al-Mukhannath means having a strong femininity in his features which make him resemble the woman in her softness and speech and looks and tone and thinking and actions, regardless if he had lewdness or not.

Various &#8220;mukhannathun&#8221; appear in several books of Rijal\u00a0and Hadeeth. It is said these transexuals accepted Islam however lived in the boundaries of Medina and Makkah.\u00a0We wish to make it clear that we are in no way attacking hermaphrodites for they are a creation from Allah (swt). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We say: The term \u201cMukhannath\u201d in the Arabic language refers to three types of people. It refers to a hermaphrodites, those with two reproductive organs and demonstrates no interest in the opposite sex, it refers to transvestites, who attempt to look like women, and it also refers to those men who are born\u00a0effeminate\u00a0or who are brought up in a way that they may cause them to be effeminate. The hermaphrodite is a creation of Allah and there are no verses or narrations that criticize this form of Mukhannath. The \u00a0transvestite Mukhannath, is the form that it criticized by the Messenger (pbuh) in the prophetic narrations. As for the last type, it depends if they commit any unlawful acts, so there is nothing special about them. It is important to differentiate between the three in order to understand the correct position towards them in the eyes of the Shari\u2019ah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">There is however evidence that points to hermaphrodites possessing acts such as buggery which if why the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw) has always been to keep a distance with such persons in that they should not live within the family unit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If RTS is suggesting that Mukhanathoon are having sexual intercourse with males, then this is completely incorrect. The Messenger (pbuh) had legislated the death punishment for acts of Sodomy. To \u201ckeep a distance\u201d from those that perform such an action would be an understatement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Just like nowadays, hermaphrodites existed during the lifetime of the Prophet (saw) and their coming into contact with him (saw), taking the Shahada and dying on that faith automatically places them within the definition of Sahabah (Companion). \u00a0We wish to reiterate that the fact that certain hermaphrodite companions existed in no way gives us the right to mock these individuals but we see some effeminate behaviors they exhibited, swayed towards their being inclined towards transvestism, as we shall evidence in this article.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no immediate connection between a person who is born as effeminate and a person who goes out of his way to look and act like a woman. As for hermaphrodites they are a medical condition. A person who is effeminate since childhood is accepted in society as long as he does not try to appear like a woman or in other words becomes a transvestite.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Now since the Bakri\u2019s have the same nauseam rant that each and every aspect of the lives of the Sahabah should be an inspiration for today\u2019s Bakri community then we invite these Bakri\u2019s to desist from attacking effeminate males and\u00a0 transvestism\u00a0\u00a0and suggesting they are plagues of a kuffar society, they should instead wholeheartedly embrace these forms of sexuality and fashion sense, and adopt these styles, whether that be at home, the workplace or during their Islamic study circles so that it is known to all asunder that the Salafis are those who have no shame in following the Sahabah of the Prophet (saw) no matter how they behaved or dressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, nobody should attack hermaphrodites, for they are the creation of Allah.

One suggests that it is Mati\u2019, the other says that it is \u2018Annah, while the narration in the Saheeh refers to him as Heet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, there are no authentic narrations that suggest that the Mukhannath should be expelled from society, in the case that he is asexual to women or in the case that he dresses normally or tries to act normally and does not voluntarily dress like women and act like them. The Mukhannath, in the narration in Saheeh Al-Bukhari was only separated away from the women because he showed sexual interest towards women, and because he described \u00a0the sexuality of another woman to a foreign man, and the Prophet (pbuh) forbade that a woman should describe the sexuality of another woman to a man. Moreover, it is absurd for RTS to suggest that Ahl Al-Sunnah should follow the path of hermaphrodites or transvestites; the former because man does not have a hand in his own creation, and the latter because the action of imitating women is condemned by the Prophet (pbuh).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">InshaAllah we succeeded in explaining the matter of &#8220;Takhneeth&#8221; for the readers and InshaAllah they\u00a0benefit\u00a0from our articles and refutations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Response to: The Queer Sahaba The following is a response to the article on RevisitingtheSalaf.org entitled: The Queer Sahaba, which was published on the 5th of April, 2012, and can be found here.
