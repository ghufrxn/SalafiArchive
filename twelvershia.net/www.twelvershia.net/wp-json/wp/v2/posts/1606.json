The revised content is more or less entirely based upon our own original work on Ibn Saba\u2019, which can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/09\/18\/abdullah-ibn-saba-the-book\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>, in other words Toyib wished\u00a0to correct big\u00a0mistakes which we exposed in his original work and he also attempted to refute some of the solid arguments we put forth but to not avail as you shall see.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is highly recommended that readers who are not familiar with our previous book to first refer to that for the sake of clarity in regards to the upcoming comments and refutations. It is also recommended for those that have read Olawuyi\u2019s revised edition to also refer to our original refutation since some of his new responses are so terribly weak that they do not warrant a reply in the first place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus we shall address only\u00a0what is worth addressing and in the name of Allah we begin,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Olawuyi Takes Back Two Critical Accusations:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Upon reading our refutation, Olawuyi indirectly conceded two points:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Point -1:<\/span> He took back his accusation against Ibn Katheer on p. 31-32 of his original book in which he accused Ibn Katheer of \u201cmanipulating\u201d a report. He went on to say in his original work:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cOur Sunni brother will never be able to trace what Ibn Kathir has attributed to Abu Ya\u2019la in any of the latter\u2019s works or reports!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then after reading our response, he wrote in the footnotes on p. 22-23 of his revised version that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201c\u2026upon further researches, we accept the possibility that he had only used a now extinct version of the book of Abu Ya\u2019la. He has been corroborated by al-Hafiz.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olawuyi is sadly too proud to admit that these \u201cfurther researches\u201d were a consequence of the refutation by twelvershia.net.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Point -2:<\/span> His accusation against Al-Barqani of attempting to authenticate a narration mentioning Ibn Saba\u2019. Refer to p. 17-18 of his original book in which he accuses Al-Barqani of being \u201c<span style=\"color: #800000;\">fallacious<\/span>\u201d and attempting to play a \u201c<span style=\"color: #800000;\">fast one<\/span>\u201d. These accusations were omitted in his revised edition due to our response to his accusation (Refer to p.22-23 in our book).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olawuyi on p. 21 of his book also took back a new Hadith sciences rule that his own <em>Ijtihad<\/em> led him to invent. This no longer exists in his revised edition! To understand what caused him to omit this point, refer to our refutation on p. 24-25 in our book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Olawuyi\u2019s personal stance towards Ibn Saba\u2019:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olawuyi (p. iv) emphasizes that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201c\u2026 at this point that we, the Sh\u012b\u2019ah Im\u0101m\u012byyah, do NOT deny the existence of \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Sab\u0101. Those of us who do that are in error, and their opinion does not bind our madhhab. It is only the Qur\u2019\u0101n and our authentic a\u1e25\u0101d\u012bth that do that. There indeed was once a man with that name, as our \u1e63a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 reports establish. However, the only statement that is true about him \u2013 from all that the Ahl al-Sunnah claim \u2013 is that he considered Am\u012br al-M\u016bmin\u012bn to be a god. Everything else is false, as nothing else is established in any reliable Sunn\u012b or Sh\u012b\u2019\u012b riw\u0101yah.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though Olawuyi is correct in asserting that the narrations about Ibn Saba\u2019 are mostly weak, it is problematic for him to act as if his views represent the Shi\u2019ee school. His personal view that Ibn Saba\u2019 was nothing more than a person that claimed godhood for Ali, contradicts the views that we have shared in our refutation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refer to p. 32 of Firaq Al-Shia by the top Shia classical historians Sa\u2019ad Al-Ash\u2019ari and Al-Nawbakhti. They have stated clearly that there is a sect called the Saba\u2019ee sect and that they are the followers of Ibn Saba\u2019. They also include that they are the first exaggerators, and that Ibn Saba\u2019 used to curse Abu Bakr and `Umar, believe in Raja\u2019ah, believed in Imamah, and was originally a Jew.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though Olawuyi can claim that these opinions hold no weight without a chain of narrations, we can safely say that the opinions of these experts have more weight than the opinion of a contemporary author. Refer to Fihrist Al-Najashi p. 63 and p. 177 for his major praise of these two scholars. Al-Najashi refers to Al-Asha\u2019ri as the Shaikh of the Ta\u2019ifah (the group), which is a title that Shias today reserve for Al-Tusi, one of the most reputable and high stationed scholars in Shia history.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; The Existence of the Saba\u2019ee Sect and their Beliefs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olawuyi (p. iv) carries on:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cWe have seen efforts by some Sunn\u012b brothers to prove all the Sunn\u012b claims about \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Sab\u0101 by mentioning the existence and doctrines of a group called al-Sab\u0101iyyah. In their opinion, if they can prove that a sect which attributed itself to Ibn Sab\u0101 existed, then they have already proved the existence of the man himself. Moreover, if they are able to establish the doctrines of this sect, then they have established the original doctrines of the man. This is however a very poor methodology, which is based upon clear logical fallacies. The fact that a group of people attribute themselves to an individual or an entity does NOT necessarily prove that he\/she\/it existed. Qur\u2019\u0101n 7:71 and 53:19-23 give vivid examples. AlL\u0101t, al-\u2018Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t were three Arab idols which existed only in \u201cnames\u201d. They had no real existence. A lot of the other idols are like that. However, it is possible to find people who attribute themselves to such imaginary idols, and who even spread weird legends about the idols\u2019 \u201cachievements\u201d and \u201cteachings\u201d! Besides that, it is quite possible to find people who have attributed themselves to a real being, but who do NOT truly or accurately represent him at all. Examples of these kinds of adherents abound in our midst. For instance, there are Christians who attribute themselves to the Christ, Prophet \u2018\u012as\u0101 b. Maryam, \u2018alaihim\u0101 al-sal\u0101m. Would it be accurate to determine the existence and true doctrines of the Christ through the existence and doctrines of Christians? On a more specific note, is it correct to claim that the Christ believed in his own divinity, or that he was the Son of God, simply because Christians make these claims? Of course, that would be very wrong!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">In the same manner, it is wrong to try to prove the existence and doctrines of \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Sab\u0101 through the claims and doctrines of al-Sab\u0101\u012byyah, who attributed themselves to him. Rather, separate authentic reports must be provided to independently and directly establish the existence of the man himself and his personal doctrines, beliefs and teachings.\u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By the grace of Allah, the above comments provided by Olawuyi do not cause a dent on the evidences brought forth in our previous book. Please refer to (p. 12-19) for more on the existence of the Saba\u2019ee sect and their beliefs. In fact, what he wrote above makes no sense as the man did exist according to reliable Sunni and Shia reports, so the example of the non-existent \u201cal-Laat and al-`Uzza\u201d is not accurate, also his example of `Isa (as) also isn\u2019t accurate since `Isa (as) was a pious prophet as is established and his followers attributed falsehood to him, Ibn Saba\u2019 on the other hand is not only proven to exist but also it is established that he was an early deviant, exaggerator and liar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We add to the above that the existence of the Saba&#8217;ee sect is accepted by late Shia scholars like Mohammad Zaid Al-Deen Al-Amili in his book Al-Shia fil Tareekh. See pages 38-39 (second edition).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Was Hujayyah Al-Kindi referred to as Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to weaken an authentic narration about Ibn Saba\u2019, Olawuyi attempted to cause readers to believe that Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019 is a weak narrator named Abdullah bin Hani\u2019, instead of the reliable Hujayyah Al-Kindi. He (p. 18) then pointed readers to the following sources: Tabaqat Ibn Sa\u2019ad, Thiqat Al-Ijli, Al-Jarh wal Ta\u2019deel by Ibn Abi Hatim, Thiqaat Ibn Hibban, Tahtheeb Al-Kamal by Al-Mizzi, and Mizan Al-I\u2019itidal by Al-Thahabi, and Taqreeb Al-Tahtheeb by Ibn Hajar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olawuyi (p.20) then claimed that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201c\u2026many top Sunni rijal scholars contradicted the suggestion that Hujayyah had the nickname \u201cAbu Al-Za\u2019ra\u2019.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is false. None of the scholars above \u201ccontradict\u201d this suggestion. A contradiction would be a direct dismissal of this nickname, or the affirmation of another nickname.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, a scholar would say, \u201cHujayyah is not Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019,\u201d or \u201cHujayyah is Abu Ahmad.\u201d These could be considered contradictions. However, the sources that Olawuyi provides do not include a nickname for Hujayyah. They simply do not mention anything about his nickname. How can this be considered a contradiction?!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Would referring to Mohammad bin Isma\u2019eel Al-Bukhari instead of Abu Abdullah Mohammad bin Isma\u2019eel Al-Bukhari be also considered a contradiction?! Perhaps Olawuyi will soon argue that Sunni scholars do not know Al-Bukhari\u2019s name since they are contradicting each other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Incompetence or Deceptiveness of Olawuyi in Quoting Narrations:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, in order for Olawuyi to strengthen his case that Hujayyah is not Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019, he quotes the narrations by these \u201ctwo men\u201d (who we maintain is one and the same person), then bolds and capitalizes the main differences in order to show that the narrations are different.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He quotes Ali via Hujayyah (p. 19) as saying: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cWho will excuse me of this<strong> evil black CONTAINER<\/strong>, who tells lies upon Allah?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then quotes Ali via Abu Al-Za\u2019ara\u2019a as saying: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cWhat does this <strong>evil black MAN<\/strong> want from me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from the fact that his translation is incorrect, Olawuyi argues that the narrations are different and that they have nothing in common and no similarities. He says: <span style=\"color: #800000;\">&#8220;Where is the similarity? Do they even resemble in any way or by any means?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, we maintain that Olawuyi was deceptive in his argumentation since he knows that the word <strong>\u062d\u0645\u064a\u062a<\/strong> (container) is similar in writing to (evil) <strong>\u062e\u0628\u064a\u062b<\/strong>, which is why Olawuyi had to resort to quoting two different sources in order to make these narrations appear as different. The first source he quotes is from Tareekh Ibn Abi Khaythama, while the second source is Lisan Al-Mizan. Once this is understood, one can easily come to the conclusion that these are mistakes by editors, which Olawuyi either purposefully used to his advantage, or simply was careless as we have known him to be.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Lisan Al-Mizan, we find that both the narration of Zaid bin Wahb and the narration of Abi Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019 and Zaid bin Wahb both include the term \u201cevil black man.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, in Tareekh Ibn Abi Khaythama, both Zaid bin Wahb and the separate narration from Hujayyah refer to him as \u201cblack container\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, in Tareekh Dimashq 16\/309, we have four narrations, two from Zaid, one from Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019, and another from Hujayyah (who is Abu Al-Za\u2019araa\u2019), and all four refer to Ibn Saba\u2019 as \u201cblack container\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; `Umar and Raja\u2019ah:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In regards to a narration in which `Umar says that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) will be sent to cut off the hands and legs of those that claimed he was dead, Olawuyi (p. 59) argues:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cThe alternative translation \u2013 \u201csend\u201d \u2013 which is offered by our Sunn\u012b brother makes no sense. For instance, \u2018Umar\u2019s words would look like this: \u201cVerily! All\u0101h will SEND him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.\u201d But, All\u0101h has already sent His Prophet decades before that period!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The translation of the word Ba\u2019atha is \u201cto send\u201d in all cases. Depending on the context one can derive what is meant. Allah (subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala) \u201csends\u201d people from their graves. He \u201csends\u201d prophets to the people. He \u201csends\u201d people to battle.
