However, SoA does not seem to be aware that this was because slave girl trade was similar to other trades, in which buyers had to rely on their senses, and not solely on the word of the salesperson. It is in this light that Ibn Umar saw it as permissible to touch slave girls (not directly, but with clothes as a separation) in order to inspect if they meet his requirements. If Ibn Umar\u2019s actions were purely sexual, then he may as well have touched her from under her clothes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One should be aware that slaves were bought and sold and that some matters that surrounded them were seen as permissible when they usually would not be.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSimilar to the above, we find that Ali, the first infallible imam, in an authentic Shia chain, did the same thing:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n[Mohammad Al-Baqir narrated from Ali (alaihi al-salam) that when he wanted to buy a slave girl, he would expose her legs and look at her.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nShia source: Qurb Al-Isnad (p. 103) by Al-Himyari.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: Ibn Umar Buying Slave Girl.
