Besides that, they were impressed by my strong arguments and asked me from which university I had graduated from. I used to answer them proudly that I graduated from al-Zayt\u016bnah University<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And on the same page, he said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Some of them even told me that my place was there, i.e. at al-Azhar\u2026 I sat on the VIP rostrum between father Shnudah and the Azhari Shaykh.

In fact I felt weak before him and wished that I had gone with my friend instead of staying with the young boys. I was not able to answer any question related to jurisprudence or history that they asked me.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: He is sought by the scholars of al-Azhar University and he boasts about it. Then suddenly, he turns incapable when facing Sh\u012b`ah boys in Najaf and tries to run away. This whole story is just an attempt by Tijani to show that Sh\u012b`ah boys are more knowledgeable than the scholars of al-Azhar. Interestingly, he wouldn\u2019t mention the name of these Azhari scholars nor the date and location of this meeting or even the names of those who invited him to al-Azhar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are not statements by a man who respects his readers and himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s look at Tijani himself, after he learned from the scholars and boys of Najaf, what did he become? A compulsive liar, who throws thoughtless accusations and invents stories to trick his readers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dear reader, what we\u2019ll include throughout the pages of this book will show you how much of a deceitful liar\u00a0and\u00a0transgressing oppressor he is,\u00a0in addition to\u00a0his deviance from the academic methodology. It will expose his ignorance and his bad intentions, and we will see what becomes of him in the near future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>2- Tijani says on pg.25 [Then I was Guided \/ In Egypt]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Didn\u2019t He (i.e All\u0101h) say in the sacred (Qudsi) narration: \u201cMy slave, give Me and you shall become like Me.

As for the moderate ones among you, they worship All\u0101h but they don\u2019t believe in the messege of Mu\u1e25ammad but curse Jibril and accuse him of betraying the trust.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Tijani then claims he received this information from history books such as Fajr-ul-Islam, Duha al-Islam and Dhuhr-ul-Islam by A\u1e25mad Amin.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This is an explicit lie for A\u1e25mad Amin never mentioned these statements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, we do believe some Sh\u012b`ah sects believe in `Al\u012b\u2019s god-hood such as the Saba\u2019iyyah. However, A\u1e25mad Amin mentioned in his books the Twelver Sh\u012b`ah sect and never attributed to them `Al\u012b\u2019s god-hood, the rejection of the message of Mu\u1e25ammad or cursing Jibril.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He attributed to them however, other blasphemous sayings that they\u2019re proud of, like the return of their Imams to life after death<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a>, that their Imams know the unseen<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a>, they revive the dead<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a>, that the Qur\u2019\u0101n is corrupted<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a>, that all Companions are apostates except three<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]<\/a>, among other clear blasphemy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>4- Tijani wrote on pg.29 [Then I was Guided \/ A Meeting on Board the Ship]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Sh\u012b`ah Mun`im said: \u201cA\u1e25mad Amin himself visited `Iraq and I was among the professors who met him in Najaf. When we reproached him about his writings regarding the Sh\u012b`ah, he apologized saying: I know nothing about you folks, I\u2019ve never been in contact with Sh\u012b`ah before this day.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This is a lie attributed to A\u1e25mad Amin. If this was true why did he not retract these statements from his books? Furthermore, al-Amin had quoted these beliefs from their relied upon books so how can he say he knew nothing about the Sh\u012b`ah!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A\u1e25mad Amin himself writes in his book, after listing their deviancies: \u201cThis, in summary, is the view of the Sh\u012b`ah concerning the Imams. It is taken from their most reliable of books based on the words of their Imams without any commentaries or footnotes.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why didn\u2019t Tijani bring this up during the life of A\u1e25mad Amin so that he could be confronted about it!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add, A\u1e25mad Amin\u2019s books are readily available. He quotes the words of al-Kulayni from al-Kafi and refers to Nahj-ul-Balaghah, Wasa\u2019il-ul-Shi`ah, Bihar-ul-Anwar and Waqfat-ul-Za\u2019irin by al-Majlisi among other Sh\u012b`ah books. I ask: Is reading these books and quoting from them not sufficient for him? Why then would he say: \u201cI know nothing about the Sh\u012b`ah\u201d!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>5- He wrote on pg.30[Then I was Guided \/ A Meeting on Board the Ship]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>I found his opinion to be good and I accompanied him to a secluded place, away from people.

His feet are on the necks of all the saints, and it was him who said, &#8220;Everyone goes around the house seven times, while the house circulates around my tents.&#8221; I tried to convince him (i.e. Mun`im) that Shaykh `Abdul-Q\u0101dir came to see his followers and treat them if they were ill and comfort them if they were depressed.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This paragraph shows a deep deviancy that Tijani had before he embraced Tashayyu`<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]<\/a>, (assuming he\u2019s telling the truth in the first place). This also shows the strong resemblance of Sufism and Tashayyu`<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]<\/a> which are two sides of the same coin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the people of Sunnah, anyone who believes that al-J\u012bl\u0101n\u012b or anybody else from among the dead, can come to his seekers and lovers openly and heal their illnesses or relieve their distress, is a disbeliever who left the folds of Islam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All\u0101h most High said: {To Him is the call of truth; and those upon whom they call, apart from Him, answer them nothing, but it is as a man who stretches out his hands to water that it may reach his mouth, and it reaches it not.

They sacrifice for them and even the moderate ones among them say, \u2018They are our means to God. We only sacrifice for All\u0101h but offer the reward for His close-friend\u2019. It is no secret, that their first words resemble those of the idol worshippers who argued {We only serve them that they may bring us nigh in nearness to God} [39:3]<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shaykh Ab\u016b Bakr al-\u1e24anbali said: \u201cGreater polytheism is six kinds: Calling on other than All\u0101h &#8211; such as prophets and saints &#8211; to provide: Livelihood, health or other matters.

The history books of our scholars are great in number, describing the lives of our pious predecessors, but if Tijani wants a dark history then he may want to check out the history of the Sh\u012b`ah. The Sh\u012b`ah have never achieved a victory for Islam at any point, nor did they conquer, nor did they resist an enemy. On the contrary, their fight was always against Ahlul-Sunnah, and history repeats itself today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the past, we do not know them for their Jihad in the name of Islam, but we do know is as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a- Their support of the Mongols who invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.

He came as part of the escort for the (Mongol) Sultan to Baghdad in order to guide the servants of God and attempt to reform the lands and extinguish tyranny and corruption by removing the capital of the kingdom of Banu al-`Abb\u0101s and causing a mass slaughter directed at the followers of those oppressors until their filthy blood spilled to form rivers.

He said, \u201cIf the circumstance of Taqiyyah forced any of us (i.e. Sh\u012b`ah) to be from the servants of the Sultans, then we must refrain from doing so even if it leads to our death. Unless, presenting oneself as an apparent follower will lead to a real victory for Islam and Muslims, such as what `Al\u012b bin Yaqt\u012bn and Nas\u012br-ul-D\u012bn al-Tus\u012b did.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We learned what Nas\u012br-ul-Din al-Tus\u012b did, so what did `Al\u012b bin Yaqt\u012bn do?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their Sh\u012b`ah scholar Ni`matullah al-Jaza\u2019ir\u012b writes: \u201cIn the narrations, `Al\u012b bin Yaqt\u012bn was the minister of (`Abb\u0101si Caliph) al-Rasheed, when a group from the opponents (i.e Sunnies) were gathered in a prison he was in charge of. Ibn Yaqtin ordered his servants to demolish the ceiling on their heads and he managed to kill around five hundred of them. He then wished to rid himself of the blood on his hands, so he sent a letter to the Imam, our master Musa al-Kadhim who told him: \u201cIf you had asked me before then you wouldn\u2019t have had their blood on your hand but since you didn\u2019t then repent for each one by sacrificing a goat and the goat is more valuable than they are.\u201d So look at this good way of offering blood-money, it is less than that the blood-money paid for their younger brother, which is the blood-money price of a hunting dog (twenty Dirhams), and less than that of their elder brothers, the Jews and Zoroastrians (eight hundred Dirhams).

We don\u2019t comprehend what modesty was there in Persia at the time, when it was part of their culture for a brother to marry his sister!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Would a Muslim say this? This is the main reason for the Sh\u012b`ah\u2019s hatred towards `Umar, it is that he destroyed the Persian Empire. It is also the same reason that they glorify al-\u1e24usayn\u2019s children rather than those of al-\u1e24asan, for al-\u1e24usayn\u2019s children are the Persian uncles from his wife Shahrabanu bin Yezdagirt<a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\">[28]<\/a>.

Our Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (peace be upon him) for example is protected in transmitting both the Book and the Sunnah {Nor doth he speak of (his own) desire.

They also believe that he is divinely protected from all major sins and character flaws. However, they differed on minor mistakes and the truth is that prophets do commit minor mistakes but do not insist upon them as evidenced by the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- {And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so he erred} [20:121]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- {O Prophet, why forbiddest thou what God has made lawful to thee} [66:1]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- {He frowned and turned away that the blind man came to him.} [80:1-2]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- {And he cast down the Tablets, and laid hold of his brother&#8217;s head, dragging him to him} [7:150]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- {It is not for any Prophet to have prisoners} [8:67]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- {Fearing other men; and God has better right for thee to fear Him} [33:37]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- {Now had he not been of those that glorify God, he would have tarried in its belly until the day they shall be raised} [37:143-144]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- {And Dawud thought that We had only tried him; therefore he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down, bowing, and he repented} [38:24]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- {God pardon thee!

There is no difference on them being protected from withholding the message or failing to convey it properly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the minor mistakes, a group from the predecessors and others permitted them for the prophets. Another group of researchers and speculative theologians deemed them infallible in both major and minor sins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of our religious leaders said: Either-way, there must be no difference that they do not insist on committing those minor mistakes or falling into many of them. Nor would they commit a minor mistake that drops their modesty and virtue or causes them to lose their reputation as these are all forbidden for prophets by consensus.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref35\">[35]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also said: \u201cYou have seen O\u2019 observer that what we established is truth and that he is infallible, peace be upon him, from ignorance regarding All\u0101h and His attributes, and that he was in a state of ignorance when it comes to these matters after prophet-hood, according to intellect and consensus, or before it, according to the texts and reports. Nor is he ignorant about any matter from what he propagated from religious laws or conveyed from his Lord from revelation according to intellect and law. Furthermore, he is protected from lying or changing his statements from the time All\u0101h sent him in his mission, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and that it is impossible for him to do so according to law, consensus, observation and evidence. We surely elevate him from this before his prophet-hood and we elevate him from major sins by consensus and from repeatedly falling into forgetfulness, error and mistakes in religious matters he established for the nation.

The people at the house then differed and quarreled amongst themselves, some of them said they should prepare the document so that the Prophet could write so they wouldn\u2019t stay, while others supported `Umar&#8217;s view.

We ask the Sh\u012b`ah, is this book a part of the message that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was ordered to deliver or not?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If yes, then he had to deliver it, but still never did so. This constitutes an attack on the Prophet (peace be upon him) and a rejection of All\u0101h\u2019s words: {Today I have completed your religion for you.} [5:3]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can also ask them another question: Where was `Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib on this event, was he present or not? Why didn\u2019t he take the initiative and write the book?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is because Imam A\u1e25mad reported in his Musnad, that `Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib said: \u201cThe Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered me to bring him a tablet so he may write for the Nation a thing that will prevent their misguidance after him. I feared he may pass away while I did that, so I said: I can memorize, I am aware. He said: He willed for us to guard the prayer, offer charity and to properly treat what our right hand possesses.\u201d A\u1e25mad Sh\u0101kir said \u201cThe chain is good\u201d.<a href=\"#_ftn76\" name=\"_ftnref76\">[76]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So `Al\u012b was the one ordered to write, why then didn\u2019t he obey and write!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer (2): They said the Prophet (peace be upon him) wished to write a will for `Al\u012b\u2019s appointment! This is false as proven by what the Prophet (peace be upon him) dictated above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer (3): The narration does not declare that the Prophet (peace be upon him) never delivered the message. `Al\u012b\u2019s \u1e25ad\u012bth shows that he did announce what he wished to have written.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer (4): Regarding the Companions\u2019 success in preventing the Prophet (peace be upon him), we say that wasn\u2019t their intention as the Prophet (peace be upon him) didn\u2019t write it down but he just said it verbally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer (5): The anger of the Prophet (peace be upon him) resembles his words to `Al\u012b in Hudaybiyyah, \u201cErase it O `Ali!\u201d but `Al\u012b refused until the Prophet (peace be upon him) took it and erased it with his hand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer (6): As for `Umar accusing the Prophet (peace be upon him) of being delusional, this is a lie and this wasn\u2019t uttered by `Umar. This statement: \u201cIs he delusional?\u201d was uttered by certain folks who witnessed the event. The authentic report in the two \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25s \u2013as quoted by the author \u2013 states the following: \u201cThey said: What is wrong with him? Is he delusional?\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn77\" name=\"_ftnref77\">[77]<\/a> In plural tense, not singular, and that\u2019s why some scholars dismissed that it be from the words of `Umar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam Ibn \u1e24ajar says: \u201cIt appears to me that the nearest possibility to truth is the third one by al-Qurtub\u012b. Those who said it must be from those who recently entered Islam, since it was known that whoever is in great pain would be burdened by it instead of being able to explain what he wishes.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn78\" name=\"_ftnref78\">[78]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shaykh al-Dihlaw\u012b said: \u201cWhere would they prove that the one who uttered those words is `Umar, when most narrations contain \u2018they said\u2019 in plural?\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn79\" name=\"_ftnref79\">[79]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was also the opinion of al-Suwayd\u012b who mentioned that a group of the late traditionalists including Ibn \u1e24ajar declared this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What these scholars declared is also what\u2019s apparent from al-Nawaw\u012b\u2019s words, when he says as he comments: \u201cThis is what\u2019s intended by their words \u2018Is he delusional?\u2019 and `Umar\u2019s words \u2018He is overcome by pain\u2019\u201d So he differentiated between the two.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This proves Tijani\u2019s slander when attributing those words to `Umar without evidence. Rather, the apparent evidence opposes his claim although this isn\u2019t a legitimate criticism towards `Umar even if established. This is also not a legitimate criticism towards those other Companions who actually said it since the text does not imply what the author claims, and this can be explained in angles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first angle: What is authentic and established is that this expression was said in the context of a question: \u201cIs he delusional?\u201d as opposed to what some reports contained: \u201cHe is delusional\u201d. The author held on to the second version although the expert researchers authenticated the first version such as al-Qad\u012b `Iy\u0101dh<a href=\"#_ftn80\" name=\"_ftnref80\">[80]<\/a>, al-Qurtub\u012b<a href=\"#_ftn81\" name=\"_ftnref81\">[81]<\/a>, al-Nawaw\u012b<a href=\"#_ftn82\" name=\"_ftnref82\">[82]<\/a> and Ibn \u1e24ajar.<a href=\"#_ftn83\" name=\"_ftnref83\">[83]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They stated that this was a rhetorical question to show disapproval towards those who said: \u201cDon\u2019t write.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After mentioning the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him) infallibility when it comes to transmitting the message in all of his conditions, al-Qurtub\u012b said that this was established among the Companions. This is why it\u2019s not possible that their statement: \u201cIs he delusional?\u201d was due to them doubting his words during sickness. Rather it was only uttered by some as an objection towards the ones who were reluctant in bringing the writing material, as if to tell them: \u201cWhy did you stop? Do you think he is delusional? If not, then bring forth the writing material for he (peace be upon him) only speaks the truth!\u201d This is the best way to interpret this.<a href=\"#_ftn84\" name=\"_ftnref84\">[84]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This shows the agreement among the Companions on the impossibility of the Prophet (peace be upon him) ever being delusional. This is because those who said it, used it as an argument to compel their opponents and therefore Tijani\u2019s claim crumbles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second way: It is possible that this expression was uttered by them when they were in a state of shock and confusion during that great calamity. A similar thing happened to `Umar and others upon the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him) as al-Qurtub\u012b said.<a href=\"#_ftn85\" name=\"_ftnref85\">[85]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: In this sense, those who uttered it are excused since men aren\u2019t taken into account if they are in a state of mental blackout or when the brain shuts down. This can happen in cases of extreme sadness or extreme happiness such as the story of a man who lost his mount then found it after losing hope so he said: \u201cO Lord, you are my slave, and I am your Lord!\u201d He erred due to his great joy.<a href=\"#_ftn86\" name=\"_ftnref86\">[86]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third way: These words were issued in the presence of the Messenger of All\u0101h (peace be upon him) and senior Companions, but they never rebuked those who said it, so this shows that they\u2019re excused either way.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for what he claimed about `Umar opposing the Messenger (peace be upon him) when he said: \u201cYou have All\u0101h\u2019s Book, it is sufficient for us,\u201d and that he never obeyed the order pertaining to that document.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We respond: None of `Umar\u2019s words show any opposition to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as Tijani misunderstood. This is shown in different ways below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first angle: It appeared to `Umar and those of his opinion from among the Companions, that the Messenger\u2019s (peace be upon him) request was not an obligatory order, rather it was out of guidance to what is best, as was explained by al-Qad\u012b `Iy\u0101d, al-Qurtub\u012b, al-Nawaw\u012b and Ibn \u1e24ajar.<a href=\"#_ftn87\" name=\"_ftnref87\">[87]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then later, `Umar\u2019s opinion proved to be the best, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself decided to abandon writing that document. If it were obligatory, then he wouldn\u2019t do that, even if they differed as that was his way.<a href=\"#_ftn88\" name=\"_ftnref88\">[88]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second angle: `Umar\u2019s words \u201cThe Book of All\u0101h is sufficient for us,\u201d was a reply to those who differed with him, not a response to the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him) order. This is apparent as he says \u201cYou (in plural) have All\u0101h\u2019s Book,\u201d when addressing that group who opposed him.<a href=\"#_ftn89\" name=\"_ftnref89\">[89]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>30- Tijani said on pg.117 [Then I Was Guided \/ The Opinion of the Quran regarding the Companions]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>All\u0101h\u2019s saying {God has promised those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness from them; they shall have; forgiveness and a mighty wage.} [5:9] (All\u0101h\u2019s words: \u201cFrom them,\u201d shows that some of them will not be included in God\u2019s forgiveness and reward. It also shows that some Companions are not described as being believers or having righteous deeds.)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: Maybe Tijani didn\u2019t learn enough from the children of Najaf and was hasty in his interpretation of All\u0101h\u2019s book. Maybe he should learn more from them before he presents his arguments to the scholars of al-Azhar whom he claims are ignorant men.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tijani\u2019s statement here can mean only one of two bitter things.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Either he\u2019s a liar for claiming that \u201cfrom\u201d (\u0645\u0646) is of a partitionary function, or he is an ignorant in the Arabic tongue, for he has described himself as being ignorant compared to the children of Najaf.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In brief, the word \u201cfrom\u201d in the verse is of an explanatory function not a partitionary one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam al-Qurtub\u012b said: \u201cThe word \u2018From\u2019 in His saying: {From them}, does not play the role of a practitioner between two groups of Companions.

The second, is that it is a promise for those of them that remain upon faith and righteous deeds.<a href=\"#_ftn93\" name=\"_ftnref93\">[93]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Kath\u012br said: {From} is to describe their kind.<a href=\"#_ftn94\" name=\"_ftnref94\">[94]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ma\u1e25m\u016bd \u1e62af\u012b said: {From} to describe the kind.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2018From\u2019 comes to explain the kind and often times it comes after: \u2018Whatever\u2019 (\u0645\u0627) and \u2018Whatsoever\u2019 (\u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627) as they have a greater claim to it due to their vagueness.

Who reported it? Yes, it is nothing but a claim that anyone can make.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Al\u012b according to the people of Sunnah is from the bravest of Companions and from the most knowledgeable. As for him being the bravest and most knowledgeable, then that is incorrect. For a detailed refutation of him being the most knowledgeable refer to section 54.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for his statement that `Al\u012b was the bravest, we reply with the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bravery can be explained by two things, the first thing is a strong and unfaltering heart when facing danger.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second is to be of a strong body and be able to kill many opponents on the field.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first matter shows true bravery whereas the second shows the toughness of the body. However, not everybody blessed with a tough body has necessarily possessed a strong brave heart and vice-versa. This is why you will see a man killing a lot of opponents as long as he has the support of his allies, but if he gets fearful he will be struck with cowardice. On the other hand, there is a man who is blessed with a steady heart, standing firm in the face of danger, even if he did not kill scores of men. This latter one is very much needed in chiefs and leaders more than the former. If the leader is brave hearted he will advance and hold his ground without backing up, his supporters will fight besides him. If he was weak hearted, he would falter and retreat, even if he was tough and skillful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet (peace be upon him) was the most perfect of men when it came to this courage of army commanders, yet he only killed one man called Ubay Ab\u012b Khalaf with his own hands, and he never killed anyone before or after Uhud, even though he was braver than all Companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Al\u012b and others used to seek safety behind the Prophet (peace be upon him) since he was braver<a href=\"#_ftn118\" name=\"_ftnref118\">[118]<\/a> even though they had more kills than he did.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the bravery required for leaders is that of the heart, then no doubt Abu Bakr was braver than `Umar and `Umar was braver than `Uthm\u0101n, `Al\u012b, \u1e6cal\u1e25a and al-Zubayr. This is known by all those who studied their biographies and stories. Abu Bakr took on the horrors alongside the Prophet (peace be upon him) without cowardice or failure. He used to step into danger to protect the Messenger (peace be upon him) with his body. He struggled against the pagans with his hand, his tongue and his wealth before anyone else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the day of Badr, he was with the Prophet (peace be upon him) in their command center under a canopy, while knowing full well that the enemy is targeting the location of the Messenger (peace be upon him), but he remained steady and strong-willed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed away, he stood and delivered a sermon to remind the Muslims, so he strengthened them and encouraged them to face the coming challenges. He prepared Us\u0101mah\u2019s army and engaged the renegades in battle and fought those who withheld their charities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The courage required for leadership was not found in such a complete way in anybody after the Messenger (peace be upon him) more than Ab\u016b Bakr and `Umar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the number of kills, there is no doubt others from the Companions had killed more pagans than `Al\u012b, so if bravery is decided by who kills more, then many Companions are braver than `Al\u012b. Al-Bar\u0101\u2019 bin M\u0101lik killed a hundred men in duels excluding those he assisted in killing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for Kh\u0101lid bin al-Wal\u012bd, the number of men he killed is beyond count.

However, he was incapable, just like Tijani, to produce a single chain for the report containing al-Mu\u1e25\u0101rib\u012b.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The whole story is that Tijani wants to deceive the reader into believing that he had researched and read books before reaching the truth, as if he found the truth out on his own.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What makes things clearer is that Tijani copied the statement of the author of al-Mur\u0101ja`\u0101t word for word. Whereas, the story about researching and looking into it himself in the \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25ayn and al-I\u1e63\u0101bah are all from lies. Truly, the rope of lies are short.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sixth point: Why did Ibn \u1e24ajar say al-Mu\u1e25\u0101rib\u012b is terribly weak when he is reliable? There are two possibilities:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One: An error in printing or copying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two: The likelier of the two is that Ibn \u1e24ajar confused al-Mu\u1e25\u0101rib\u012b with al-Aslam\u012b, since both are called Ya\u1e25y\u0101 bin Ya`l\u0101. So he mistakenly wrote al-Mu\u1e25\u0101rib\u012b instead of al-Aslam\u012b and only the Glorious One is free from error. The evidence for this possibility is that Ibn \u1e24ajar did in fact declare that al-Mu\u1e25\u0101rib\u012b in is trustworthy in his book al-Taqr\u012bb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Abdul-\u1e24usayn, Tijani and their comrades only attacked al-\u1e24afidh Ibn \u1e24ajar since they love fishing in troubled waters, but All\u0101h willed for the truth to remain clear.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>59- Tijani said on pg.198 [Then I Was Guided \/ The Correct Prophetic Traditions which Indicate the Fact that it is Compulsory to Follow the Ahl al Bayt \/ The Prophetic Tradition: \u201cHe Who Wishes to Live Like Me\u201d]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>An example is the narration of: \u201cThe caliphs after me are twelve, all of them are from Quraysh.\u201d In a variation of the narration, it states that \u201call are from Ban\u016b H\u0101shim\u201d.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>These reports are found in Bukh\u0101r\u012b, Muslim and all \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25s of Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jam\u0101`ah.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: May All\u0101h destroy the liars. The narration of: \u201cThe caliphs after me are twelve, all of them are from Quraysh,\u201d is popular, but this isn\u2019t the correct text. Rather, what the popular variation states that \u201cthe affairs of the people will continue to be conducted as long as they\u2019re ruled by twelve men, all of them from Quraysh.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are also other versions and there is no harm in mentioning them:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-This matter shall not come to pass until twelve caliphs come to rule, all from Quraysh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Islam shall remain glorious until twelve caliphs pass, all of them from Quraysh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The religion will continue to be upright until the hour or until you\u2019ve been ruled by twelve caliphs, all of them from Quraysh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-This religion will remain glorious and resilient until twelve caliphs, all from Quraysh.<a href=\"#_ftn191\" name=\"_ftnref191\">[191]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps you have noticed a couple of things dear reader:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One: The difference in the texts between what is written in \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 Muslim compared to what Tijani wrote.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two: None of these narrations include \u201call of them are from Ban\u016b H\u0101shim\u201d. This was from Tijani\u2019s endless sack of lies, as it seems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the first matter, you saw that the correct texts do not imply what Tijani wishes for us to believe for several reasons:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The narration states that those twelve will be caliphs who will rule the people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; None of the men Sh\u012b`ah believe in ruled except `Al\u012b and \u1e24asan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The narration states that religion will remain in a state of glory until the rule of these twelve comes to pass. However, Sh\u012b`ah believe the 12<sup>th<\/sup> man never came out, yet Muslims are living in disgrace and weakness, and All\u0101h knows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) never lied nor was he accused of lying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A questioner might ask: Is it a coincidence that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \u201cUntil twelve rule,\u201d or, \u201cuntil twelve receive authority over Muslims,\u201d and that the number of Sh\u012b`ah divine leaders is also twelve?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer: It definitely is no coincidence, since the earliest of Sh\u012b`ah never believed in the leadership of twelve men in specific and that is why they split into many sects. Some of them only believed in `Al\u012b\u2019s divine leadership and they\u2019re called Saba\u2019iyyah. Another group believed in his divine leadership and that of his children \u1e24asan, \u1e24usayn and Mu\u1e25ammad, and they\u2019re called Kays\u0101niyyah. Another group believed in the divine leadership of these men until Ja`far bin Mu\u1e25ammad and stopped at this number. As for Twelvers, they believe in the leadership of the Awaited One.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other teams also existed with many differences, so whoever wishes to learn more can refer to the book of al-Nawbakht\u012b about Sh\u012b`ah sects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You O\u2019 dear brother see that the belief in the twelve came very late, otherwise the early Sh\u012b`ah themselves would not have differed this much. Those narrations have only been invented a while after the Prophet (peace be upon him) and most of the Sh\u012b`ah Imams had already passed away.<a href=\"#_ftn192\" name=\"_ftnref192\">[192]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has become clear, dear reader, that the Sh\u012b`ah themselves have attempted to match the number of their leaders to the number uttered by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in that narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally: The authentic report says: \u201cAll of them are from Quraysh,\u201d and the Prophet (peace be upon him) would never mention what is general if he intended what is more specific. This opposes eloquence and clarity of speech; these are two major qualities of our Prophet (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For instance, if I were to say, \u201cI shall offer a Dirham for every Arab.\u201d Then, when an Egyptian comes asking for a Dirham I tell him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I meant the Syrians only.\u201d He would accuse me of foolishness and idiocy and yell, \u201cWell why didn\u2019t you say: For every Syrian, then!?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Prophet (peace be upon him) had meant `Al\u012b and his children, he would have simply said, \u201cThey are `Al\u012b and his children.\u201d Even if he said: \u201cAll of them are from Ban\u016b H\u0101shim,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t have been clear, since they were many, and Quraysh are more numerous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Tijani and his likes argue based on the similarity between both numbers, then what about the narration by Imam Muslim, in which the Messenger (peace be upon him) says: \u201cIn my nation are twelve hypocrites\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn193\" name=\"_ftnref193\">[193]<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>60- Tijani wrote on pg.200 [Then I Was Guided \/ The Correct Prophetic Traditions which Indicate the Fact that it is Compulsory to Follow the Ahl al Bayt \/ The Prophetic Tradition: \u201cHe Who Wishes to Live Like Me\u201d]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b had reported in his \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25, in the Chapter of Wills, as well as Muslim in his \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25, in the Chapter of Wills, that it was mentioned to `\u0100\u2019ishah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had passed his will to `Ali.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: He cut off a part of the narration.

Say: &#8216;Produce your proof, if you speak truly.&#8217;} [2:111]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then one would argue that All\u0101h mentions in His book that the Jews and Christians only enter heaven, without continuing the rest of the verse and how All\u0101h responds to this claim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tijani, here, tried to do this. He said when mentioning `\u0100\u2019ishah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed a will to `Al\u012b without continuing the narrative. However, I shall continue it for him: Al-Aswad bin Yaz\u012bd said: \u201cThey mentioned to `\u0100\u2019ishah that `Al\u012b was made to be the executioner of the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him) will. She asked: \u2018When did he pass him a will? I was resting him (peace be upon him) on my chest, then he asked for a bucket and slid himself to sleep on my lap and passed away without me noticing.
