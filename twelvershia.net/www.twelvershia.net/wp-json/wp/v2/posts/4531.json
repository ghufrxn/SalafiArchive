After appealing to a series of unverified premises and weak reports, polemicists will often invite non-Shias to join the Twelver faith based on the claim that the religion of Islam should solely be sought through\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait<\/em>, the Prophet&#8217;s household. A careful observer, however, would recognize that this\u00a0 appeal ultimately stems from a false dichotomy. The distinction between\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait<\/em> and non-<em>Ahlulbait <\/em>figures, with regards to the transmission of religious teachings,\u00a0is quite arbitrary.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best phenomena that demonstrate this reality is the fact that individuals and <em>imams<\/em> from\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait <\/em>openly\u00a0transmitted hadiths from the <em>Sahabah<\/em>. Contrary to what Twelver polemicists may claim, the <em>imams<\/em> of Ahlulbait did not solely transmit hadith from &#8220;infallible&#8221; sources. Rather, plenty of evidence exists to demonstrate that various imams did, in fact, transmit reports from the <em>Sahabah\u00a0<\/em>and other individuals who disseminated Prophetic traditions. In this article, we shall present a few examples of this phenomenon:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Report #1<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting mass-transmitted (<em>mutawatir<\/em>)\u00a0report from Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadeq found in various sources.

In the first\u00a0<em>rak&#8217;ah,\u00a0<\/em>Abu Hurayrah recited Surah Al-Jumu&#8217;ah, and in the second\u00a0<em>rak&#8217;ah ,\u00a0<\/em>he recited Surah\u00a0Al-Munafiqun. &#8216;Ubaydullah then told Abu Hurayrah: &#8220;You&#8217;ve recited a recitation which &#8216;Ali recited among us in Kufah.&#8221; In most redactions, Abu Hurayrah is then quoted saying: &#8220;I heard my love, Abu Al-Qasem\u00a0\ufdfa, recite them both.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4555\" src=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"12568\" height=\"4448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2.png 12568w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2-300x106.png 300w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2-768x272.png 768w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ahl-2-1024x362.png 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 12568px) 100vw, 12568px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Figure 1.<\/strong> Chains of transmission for Ja&#8217;far&#8217;s report from Abu Hurayrah on Friday prayer<\/p>\n<p>This report is\u00a0<em>mutawatir\u00a0<\/em>(mass-transmitted) from Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadeq.

If Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq and Al-Baqir both held the position that Abu Hurayrah, &#8216;Abdurrahman and other companions of the Prophet were liars who ultimately aimed to distort Islam, as claimed by the Shi&#8217;ite polemicists, then it would be preposterous for them to continue disseminating hadiths through these sources. Why would Ja&#8217;far reproduce an isnad transmitted through Abu Hurayrah when he could otherwise transmit the same report through &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb?<\/p>\n<p>When faced with these reports, Shi&#8217;ite polemicists first attempt to deflect the entire argument by denying the authenticity of these hadiths due to the fact that they come from Sunni sources. These desperate appeals, however, are fruitless, since these reports are\u00a0<em>mutawatir\u00a0<\/em>from Ja&#8217;far. They are definitively authentic to him, and they cannot be simply dismissed in an <em>ad hoc\u00a0<\/em>manner\u00a0on the basis of their sources&#8217; alleged theological leanings.<\/p>\n<p>When Shi&#8217;ite polemicists recognize that their attempts to dismiss these reports are futile, they then appeal to the most blunderous and preposterous of all cop-outs:\u00a0<em>Taqiyyah<\/em>. Instead of actually addressing the historical argument(s) presented, they appeal to a brittle theological doctrine in a desperate attempt to appropriate the texts. They will thus claim that Ja&#8217;far only reproduced these reports in the aforementioned manner out of fear for his life. This appeal, however, is pathetic and astonishing at the same time. What would have happened if Ja&#8217;far transmitted the reports through &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb?<\/p>\n<p>The obvious answer to that question is: &#8220;nothing.&#8221; First, second and third century Sunni hadith collections are replete with reports ascribed to &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb and other members of his family. Sunni and non-Sunni transmitters of hadith openly transmitted reports from &#8216;Ali and other members of the Prophets family in that era. Hundreds of reports in the Sunni tradition are, in fact, transmitted through Al-Sadeq and Al-Baqir from &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb. To suggest that Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq feared ascribing a few reports to &#8216;Ali and thus ascribed them to alleged forgers is more of an insult to Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon similarly serves as an argument that dispels the Twelver claim that Sunnis refrained from transmitting hadith through\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait<\/em>. In such examples, Sunni hadith collections can be observed documenting traditions from the Prophet&#8217;s household along with other reliable sources.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Contrary to what is claimed by Shi&#8217;ite polemicists, the <em>imams<\/em> of\u00a0<em>Ahlulbait\u00a0<\/em>did not exclusively transmit hadith from infallible sources. Rather, we see that Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadeq, Al-Baqir and others transmitted hadiths from various companions of the Prophet \ufdfa. Some of these companions are even reviled in the Twelver tradition, yet we find the earlier historical sources authentically quoting the imams transmitting hadiths through them. Indeed this phenomenon is worthy of further analysis, as it casts doubt on the entire Shi&#8217;ite narrative pertaining to the\u00a0<em>imams<\/em> and the <em>Sahabah<\/em><em>.\u00a0<\/em>Only in later (Shi&#8217;ite) sources are the\u00a0<em>imams<\/em> presented reviling companions of the Prophet, such as Abu Hurayrah, &#8216;Abdurrahman b. &#8216;Awf and &#8216;Umar etc.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon gives rise to various questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did Ja&#8217;far Al-Sadiq and Muhammad Al-Baqir ascribe traditions to the Prophet \ufdfa through alleged liars and forgers, according to the Twelver tradition?<\/li>\n<li>Why did they not transmit these reports from &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb, as they did with hundreds of other reports in the Sunni tradition?<\/li>\n<li>Is it acceptable for the\u00a0<em>imams<\/em> to publicly ascribe lies to the Prophet out of fear?<\/li>\n<li>If the answer to the previous question is\u00a0 &#8220;yes&#8221;, then what is the point of their infallibility if they still end up ascribing falsehood to the Prophet and God?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Nevertheless, we do not expect much asides from a few theological cop-outs that are usually presented by our Shi&#8217;ite counterparts in response to these questions. Dismissing the argument by appealing to\u00a0<em>ad hoc<\/em> explanations that attempt to appropriate the texts is not sufficient nor is it an intellectually honest endeavor. Rather, we hope that to see progress in the quality of the discourse, which manifests in mature and intellectually honest responses.<\/p>\n<p>And Allah is the best of witnesses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Sources<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Al-Jawahiri, Muhammad.\u00a0<em>Al-Mufid Min Mo\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith<\/em>. 2nd ed., vol. 1 1, Al-\u2018Ilmiyyah, 1424.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Shi&#8217;ite apologists often claim that the Twelver faith is a manifestation of the true teachings of the Prophet&#8217;s household.
