Abi Taleb. \u00a0The origin of this dispute stems from the presence of a wide variety of reports and traditions that depict \u2018Ali in varying manners. There are a few reasons as to why such a shockingly large number of (often contradicting) reports regarding the virtues of \u2018Ali exist. Most significant of them is the widespread circulation of numerous fabricated reports and forgeries that attempt to display and exaggerate the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, this confusion in the nature of \u2018Ali seems to have started at the end of his life. A report in Sahih al-Bukhari alludes to this, as the renowned <em>tabi\u2019i<\/em>, Al-Sha\u2019bi, reports:<\/p>\n<p>I once saw Abu Juhaifah approach \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb and ask him: \u201cDo you have any knowledge that is not in the Quran or dispersed among the masses?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ali responds saying: \u201cBy the one who split the grain and created the soul, we have nothing except what is in the Quran and the understanding of the Quran endowed to a man by Allah; and what is in this document.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I asked: \u201cWhat is in this document?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Ali responds: \u201cRegulations pertaining to blood money, the ransom of the captive and that a believer must not be killed for killing a disbeliever.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>As evident in this report, the questioner, Abu Juhaifah, approaches \u2018Ali asking him about the nature of his own knowledge. In this context, such bizarre questions and doubts should not come as a surprise to the reader. They often arose as a result of fabricated reports that were widely circulated in the city of Kufah, where \u2018Ali and the later Shi\u2019a were based. Numerous hadith critics took note of this bizarre and widespread circulation of fabricated reports regarding the virtues of \u2018Ali.<\/p>\n<p>The notable hadith critic, Abu Ya\u2019la al-Khalili (died 446 AH), quotes a hadith critic saying:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have observed the reports that were fabricated by the Kufans regarding the virtues of \u2018Ali and Ahlulbait, and I saw that they were more than 300,000 fabricated reports.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ibn al-Jawzi said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Rafida\u2019s extreme love of Ali led them to fabricate many reports demonstrating his virtues. Most of these reports actually ended up harming him and depicting him in a negative manner. I have listed some of those reports in my book, <em>al-Mawdu\u2019aat.<\/em>\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yahya b. Ma\u2019in quotes the forger, Mu\u2019alla b. Abdurrahman al-Wasiti (on his deathbed), saying: \u201cI have fabricated 90 hadiths in the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ibn Hibban describes the forger, Abu al-Jarud al-Thaqafi, saying:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a Rafidi who used to fabricate baseless reports regarding the blunders of the Sahabah and the virtues of Ahlulbait. His hadiths should not be written.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Kufan forger and transmitter, Matar b. Maymun, was described in al-Majruhin with the following:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe used to transmit fabrications through reliable transmitters. He transmitted baseless reports from Anas b. Malik in the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>These are a few examples that demonstrate the prevalence of this historical phenomenon where forgers took advantage of the Shi\u2019i zeal for \u2018Ali and Ahlulbait by fabricating reports that displayed and exaggerated their virtues.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Imam al-Bukhari concludes the chapter in his Sahih on the virtues of \u2018Ali with the following report:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIbn Sirin considered most reports transmitted about \u2018Ali to be fabricated.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>After observing this reality, one may ask: where are the <u>authentic<\/u> reports to the Prophet that display the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb?<\/p>\n<p>The answer to that question is very simple: <u>there are several authentic hadiths on the virtues of \u2018Ali; however, they are not as exaggerated and plentiful as the Shi\u2019a make them seem<\/u>. Numerous Sunni <em>Muhaddithin<\/em>, such as the authors of the six books, transmitted reports that demonstrated the Prophet\u2019s praise of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Authentic Reports:<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Before listing all hadiths that demonstrated the virtues of \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb, it is important to note that all reports containing praise of the companions of the Prophet \ufdfa or Ahlulbait span \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb as well. In this context, however, we will only list authentic hadiths that explicitly mention \u2018Ali b. Abi Taleb:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmed b. Hanbal and others reported that Sahl b. Sa\u2019d said:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote><p>During the Battle of Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: &#8220;Tomorrow, I shall grant the banner to a man through whom Allah shall grant victory; he loves Allah and His messenger, and he is beloved to them both.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Everyone spent the night thinking about who would be given the banner. On the next morning, they all went to the Prophet, each hoping that he would be given the banner. The Prophet said: &#8220;Where is `Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>They replied: &#8220;He is suffering from trouble in his eyes, O Messenger of Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet said: &#8220;Send for him and bring him here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When `Ali arrived, the Prophet spat in his eyes and made du\u2019aa for him, and \u2018Ali was immediately cured as though he had not been previously afflicted with any illness.<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet then gave him the banner, and `Ali asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, shall I fight them until they become like us?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet \ufdfa said: &#8220;Approach them steadily until you are in their field. Then, invite them to Islam and inform them of their obligations. For by Allah, if Allah is to guide a single man through you, then that shall be better for you than the possession of red camels.&#8221;<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Al-Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tirmidhi, Ahmed b.

Ali said: \u201cDo you leave me behind with the women and children?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet \ufdfa said: &#8220;Are you not be pleased that you shall be to me as Harun was to Musa?

Abi Taleb, and I was told that he went to bring the Messenger of Allah. He then came, and the Messenger of Allah entered, and I entered as well. The Messenger of Allah sat on the mattress. He then placed Fatimah on his right side, \u2018Ali on his left side, and al-Hasan and al-Husain on his lap. Then he recited: \u201cAllah only desires to take away any <em>rijs<\/em> from you, O people of the household, and purify you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then he said: \u201cO Allah these individuals are my family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wathilah said: \u201cI, standing at the side of the house, asked: what about me O Messenger of Allah, am I from your family too?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Prophet \ufdfa said: \u201cYou are from my family as well.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Al-Bukhari, Ahmed b.

Sahl refused to do so; thus, the governor said: \u201cIf you are to object to that, then at least say: May Allah curse Abu Turab.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sahl responded: \u201cThere was no name dearer to `Ali than Abu Turab. He used to rejoice when he was called by that name.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The governor then said: \u201cNarrate to us this story. Why was he called Abu Turab?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sahl said: The Messenger of Allah once came to the house of Fatima, and he did not find `Ali in the house.
