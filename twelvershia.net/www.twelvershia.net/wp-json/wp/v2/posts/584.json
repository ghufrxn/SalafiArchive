We do not believe that falsehood would ever appear in its ugly true image because then it would not be accepted nor welcomed or adopted. This is why many men are dazzled and fooled by such fake images as they lack knowledge and perception and the ability to analyze the different opinions and evidence.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why the greatest of actions in the sight of Allah almighty is one which is taken to defend his religion, to stop falsehood in its tracks and expose the fakeness that is masked by purity and piety and the great concern for Islamic unity. There needs to be a cry of truth, loud and clear, a cry to shake the foundations of falsehood and reduce it to its original weak and pathetic form, to wake up those who have been blinded by the pleasant outward appearance of this falsehood which is being spread by huge organizations that are backed by several countries whose sole purpose is to &#8220;beautify&#8221; this falsehood in the eyes of the ignorant masses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These organization have placed huge efforts especially in these past two decades to cast arrows of doubt on all the beliefs of the people of Islam and to poison the pure well of Islamic faith which is very far from the perverseness of Mazdak and the deviance of Zoroaster.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have thus decided in this moment of weakness, and in these hard times that our nation is facing, to expel the darkness and make public to all the wickedness and maliciousness of those folks who have always been enemies to this religion and all that it represents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Introduction:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the past I had went through a book by one of the biggest contemporary scholars of the Imami Shia sect and he is `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen, and his books are still being printed, print after print, and they generally are books full of lies, mis-quotations and mis-attributions which showcase the hatred these people have for Islamic history and Islamic figures, and so the man placed great effort in distorting the image of historical Islamic figures and icons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We must remind the reader that this book is not intended to refute `Abdul-Husayn&#8217;s books, but it is aimed at a specific issue which is the expression &#8220;al-Salatu Khayrun min al-Nawm.&#8221; or &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep.&#8221; which Ahlul-Sunnah include in their call to prayer during Fajr. However, since `Abdul-Husayn was the first to expand on this issue from among his companions, and he took the lead in spreading the matter then we shall look into what he argued.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Imami Shia sect has accused Ahlul-Sunnah in general and `Umar ibn al-Khattab (ra) in specific of adding to the Adhan (1) the expression &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep.&#8221; so we will show how this expression is established in the religion of Islam and how it was a part of the Adhan during the time of the Prophet (SAWS), and the four rightly guided Caliphs after him especially `Ali ibn abi Talib (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(1) Adhan: Islamic call to prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this book we do not only aim to refute a single doubt that the Shia have cast on the religion of Islam, but we intend to refute and expose an entire methodology, the twisted method of the Shia in slandering their opponents, in covering the truth with falsehood and in the double standards and hypocrisy which they have built their entire religion upon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We ask Allah to make it easy for us, and to accept from us this work, and to guide us all to what he loves and pleases, He is our Master.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>A false charge:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We do not find it strange that such a big amount of lies and accusations have been directed towards the companions of the Prophet (SAWS) especially the first four Caliphs of Islam, this is because historically most accusations are directed to the greatest of personalities and virtuous men by a bunch of low-lives with evil intentions and filthy interests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We do not find such a thing strange at all once we realize that these false charges come from a group of people, who curse the companions of our Prophet (SAWS) and slander them because it is the smallest of their sins, since they raise their saints to the level of gods!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The great Islamic conquests and the spreading of Islamic teachings and knowledge in the four corners of the earth, is reduced in the eyes of these filthy men to a couple of mere attempts to expand influence and seize the resources of the lands for personal gain. Yes, these Ghulat (2) were educated to believe that virtuous act accomplished by the pious companions may Allah be pleased with them is an evil act covered with ill will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(2) Ghulat: Extremists.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reader shall see many examples of this as we go on, as for the companions of the messenger may Allah be pleased with them, who sacrificed everything for their Prophet (SAWS) and his religion, and struggled in the battle-fields against the un-believers, and exhausted their bodies in the call to Islam, the culture they built in the eyes of the folks is no more than a culture of violence and thieves and usurpers, because history is fake, and the Qur&#8217;an is corrupted and insufficient, and the Prophet (SAWS) is helpless, and the infallible Imam is persecuted and weak, and the savior has been hiding for hundreds of years, and so Islamic history is reduced to a couple of people while everybody else is either a thief or a liar and a conspirator ect&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add, that trying to convince these people that their methods are wrong and their Madhab is corrupt is almost impossible because the sect we are addressing has fallen victim to an extreme form of brainwashing, but nonetheless we shall do our duty in delivering the truth and guiding the lost.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Imami Shia sect asserts that the expression &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; is a fabrication by `Umar ibn al-Khattab (ra), and that Ahlul-Sunnah have simply followed the orders of the second Caliph in affirming this expression and they tried to bestow legitimacy to it by calling it &#8220;al-Tathweeb&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia scholar Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi says in &#8220;Mu`jam Fiqh al-Jawahir&#8221; 1\/207:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Tathweeb in Adhan, as is famous among the linguists and jurists is saying: &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What the Shia sources mentioned about this matter:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Almost all late Shia sources are in agreement that it was `Umar (ra) who is the first to fabricate &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; and add it to the Adhan, and you almost don&#8217;t find any of the Shia scholars or their laymen say anything other than this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To shed more light on the matter, we quote the late Shia scholar `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen al-Musawi who didn&#8217;t spend his life fighting against communism and atheism and socialism which were the talk of the hour during his life, because when the red communist influence was expanding from continent to continent, and when the communists were attempting to swallow the entire Islamic world piece by piece, we find our friend `Abdul-Husayn using his pen as a pickaxe to destroy what remains of faith in the people&#8217;s hearts and by writing books which contained as many attacks on Islam as he could possibly find.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in &#8220;al-Fusoul al-Muhimmah fi Ta&#8217;leef al-Ummah&#8221; pg.117:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And from them is their alteration of the morning call to prayer, as they changed it by inserting into it what was not in it during the days of Rassul-Allah (SAWS), which is &#8220;al-Salatu Khayrun min al-Nawm&#8221;, but rather it was not in it during the days of Abu Bakr, it is only that the second Khalifah ordered it as the Mutawatir (3) narrations of the pure progeny state.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for other sources, it is sufficient for the reader to know what the Imam Malik narrated in the chapter of the call to prayer\u00a0 in his Muwatta&#8217;: &#8220;That it had reached him that the Mu&#8217;adhin (4) came to `Umar bin al-Khattab to call him to prayer but found him asleep, so he said: Prayer is better than sleep. Then he ordered him to make it in the call of the morning.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And al-`Allamah al-Zarqani said while commenting on this Hadith in his explanation of the Muwatta&#8217;: &#8220;This report was narrated by al-Daraqutni in his Sunan from Waki` in his Musannaf from al-`Umari from Nafi` from ibn `Umar from `Umar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Suffiyan narrated from Muhammad bin `Ajlan from Nafi` from ibn `Umar from `Umar that he said to his Mu&#8217;adhin: If you reach &#8220;Come to success&#8221; in your Fajr call, then say: Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This was narrated by ibn abi Shaybah from the narration of Hisham bin `Urwah, and it was narrated by a group of others that we shall not mention.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And you (reader) know that there is no trace of such an expression in the narrations of the prophet (saws), if you would like to verify you can revise the chapters of Adhan in the first part of Sahih al-Bukhari and the chapter on the description of Adhan and it is the beginning of the book of Salat in Sahih Muslim.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(3) Mutawatir: Mass transmitted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(4) Mu&#8217;adhin: Man responsible of making the call to prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the Shia argument which is used to raise doubts on the position of Ahlul-Sunnah, the Shia author tried his best to collect every statement of any classical or contemporary scholar in order to make his accusation on Ameer al-Mu&#8217;mineen `Umar bin al-Khattab (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact the leader of the Shia and their Imam `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen was so proud of himself that he raised this same doubt in his book &#8220;al-Nas wal-Ijtihad&#8221;. So to Allah we belong and to him we shall return, this is a new age that has dawned upon our nation, an age where there is no justice or knowledge, an age where the pathetic are raised to become leaders and icons while the true icons are lowered and mocked.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Attack is the best method of defense:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we analyze this claim, we need to inform the readers and the Imami Shia in specific of\u00a0 an important matter. The sane Shia must know that their scholars have adopted a twisted method to defend against every criticism directed towards their Madhab, it is a method they use every-time their opponents defeat them in debate or silence them with clear proofs or prove to them the corruption of their Madhab. We shall explain below:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever a criticism is directed towards the Imamiyyah proving to them that they have a certain problem, you will see them trying to prove that their opponents the Ahlul-Sunnah have similar a similar problem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, instead of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Proving through Islamic texts that the matter is not a problem and that the ones throwing the accusation are wrong.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Agreeing that there is indeed a mistake on their part, and admitting that they have a problem, and then calling their followers to abandon it and correct it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of fixing the problem and defending their Madhab, we see the Shia scholars hurling similar accusations on other Madhabs in an attempt to escape those criticisms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to make this clearer for the reader, I place in your hands one out of many live examples:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the opponents of the Shia criticized them for adding the following expression to their Adhan &#8220;I bear witness that `Ali is the friend of Allah&#8221;, and they told them that this is a forbidden innovation and that the Imams narrated narrations that did not contain this expression and that they also narrated that innovations are evil, the Imami Shia scholars attacked Ahlul-Sunnah with &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; as if telling us: &#8220;Why do you oppose us in this when we are all doing innovations at the end of the day?&#8221; .<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: There is no doubt about the corruption of this method, because the goal of this method is not to prove the truth and reach it. It&#8217;s only goal is to change the subject and escape the criticism, like two men who met and one of them told the other: &#8220;You are a thief!&#8221; so the other man responded by saying: &#8220;Well you&#8217;re also a thief!&#8221; and by doing so he admitted that he himself is one!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This also makes the Shia Madhab a reactionary one that is affected by the Madhab of Ahlul-Sunnah, and they would follow them like their tail, so whatever Ahlul-Sunnah agree on or decide will be the standard to be used in authenticating or weakening or proving right from wrong. Also this method is based on the opponent\u00a0 being from Ahlul-Sunnah, so what if the opponents were from the Waqifi Shia or even a Twelver such as ibn Babaweih al-Qummi? Would this method work with him? Or would the Shia scholars be stuck then? More importantly what will be their answer in front of Allah on the day of judgment?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why it is the duty of every Shia that when he sees one of their scholars on the Mimbar defending his Madhab by attacking Ahlul-Sunnah, that he should tell him to abandon this twisted method and give a proper scholarly refutation to the problem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now we shall go back to the topic and prove by the grace of Allah the ignorance of the one who claims that `Umar (ra) invented Tathweeb and added it to the Adhan, and that it was an order from the Prophet (SAWS) and was practiced during his days and the days of the companions and their followers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Refuting the doubts raised by `Abdul-Husayn:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to refute this blind man we need to sum up his argument in a few organized points:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- That there is no proof that &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; is a saying of the Prophet (SAWS).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- That there is no mention of this expression in Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- This expression was not available in the Adhan in Abu Bakr&#8217;s (ra) Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- `Umar (ra) was the one to add the expression to the Adhan during his Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- `Abdul-Husayn stated several sources for narrations that he claims back up this accusation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- The Mutawatir mass transmitted narrations from Ahlul-Bayt prove that it was `Umar (ra) who added it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>THE ANSWERS TO HIS SIX POINTS RESPECTIVELY:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>1- FIRST ARGUMENT:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Abdul-Husayn says in &#8220;al-Nas wal-Ijtihad&#8221;

by al-Muttaqi al-Hindi, this book that the Shia scholars often refer to in order to attack Ahlul-Sunnah and the Sahaba (ra), the author of that book alone lists twenty seven narrations proving that &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; is a prophetic tradition, and `Ala&#8217;-ul-Deen al-Baseer mentions only one of them from the sixty seven narrations he listed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the authenticity of the narration, the opponents are using only one weak narration as an argument against `Umar (ra), so it is enough if we prove the authenticity of only one of the many narrations declaring Tathweeb as being a part of the Sunnah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For this we quickly refer to Sunan al-Bayhaqi al-Kubra 1\/423, where he narrates the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Abu Bakr bin al-Harith al-Faqih told us, `Ali bin `Umar al-Hafiz told us, al-Husayn bin Isma`il told us, Muhammad bin `Uthman bin Karamah told us, abu Usamah told us, ibn `Awn told us, from Muhammad, from Anas that he said: &#8220;It is from the Sunnah that if the Mu&#8217;adhin reached in the Fajr Adhan &#8220;Hay `ala al-Falah&#8221;, that he should say &#8220;al-Salatu Khayrun min al-Nawm, al-Salatu Khayrun min al-Nawm, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Allah.&#8221;

It would be enough to quote what al-Imam al-Qurtubi (rah) said with regards to this narration when he quoted ibn `Abdul-Barr in &#8220;Tanweer al-Hawalik&#8221; pg.92:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I do not know that this was narrated about `Umar in any authentic way, it is only in the narration of Hisham ibn `Urwah from some man called Isma`eel and I do not know him, but the Tathweeb is known to be from the Adhan of Bilal and abi Mahdhourah in the\u00a0 morning prayer of the Prophet (SAWS).]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration is &#8220;Majhool&#8221; which is the weakest form of narration, so it has to be rejected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- The Matn (Text).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if the narration was authentic it can still be given an interpretation so as to reconcile between it and the numerous narrations that state that it was a prophetic order. It can be said that the Mu&#8217;adhin of `Umar (ra) came and saw him sleeping, so he called &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; but `Umar (ra) did not accept this and told him to only announce it during the call to prayer as was the habit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the reader can see, the Shia are very desperate in their attempts to criticize the chief of believers `Umar bin al-Khattab (ra), and all of their accusations against this great companion are similar to this one in terms of weakness and absurdity. In fact, whenever their scholars write books to attack Ahlul-Sunnah and the religion in general, this weak narration is always used as an argument, as if they all agreed to follow the same twisted hypocritical path and I shall list some of their sources who mention this narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Ameer Muhammad Kazimi in &#8220;al-Shia fi `Aqa&#8217;idihim wa Ahkamihim&#8221;

when he got the chance to talk about &#8220;prayer is better than sleep&#8221;, as his hatred for `Umar (ra) and for this nation&#8217;s history got the better of him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When this Shia al-Subhani accused `Umar (ra) of this matter in his book &#8220;al-I`tisam bil-kitab wal-Sunnah&#8221;

Furthermore, what great motive is this which pushes him to add such a statement &#8220;prayer is better than sleep&#8221; to the Adhan? An intelligent mind would reject such an accusation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And when he presents it to the authentic history, didn&#8217;t he notice that authentic or even non-authentic history never mentioned that `Umar (ra) changed anything in the Adhan?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, when he presents it to the consensus of the nation, which nation is this that agreed to believe that `Umar (ra) added that phrase to the Adhan?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truly the example of the Shia scholars is that of a wondering Arab whom they asked:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;How is it that you have controlled the people?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He replied:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I excel in lying and when someone dies I make sure to attend his funeral.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like a politician.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What is the origin of this accusation?<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To learn the origins of this claim we will look at two matters:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>First matter:<\/b> Who accused `Umar (ra) of adding the expression to Adhan?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The one who reads all the books of Ahlul-Sunnah will not find anyone mentioning that `Umar (ra) added an expression to the Adhan, whether it is authentic books or books of weak narrations or books of history or any other books, even the Sunni books whose authors are said to be Shia or of Shia tendencies like al-Mas`udi or al-Waqidi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is that this accusation came from the books of the Shia Hadith scholars exclusively, only they accused our master `Umar (ra) of altering the Adhan. Not all of them mentioned it however, as this &#8220;theory&#8221; was not known to the early Shia scholars of Hadith such as ibn Shadhan, al-Tusi, al-Murtada, al-Mufid, al-Saduq, ibn al-Salah and the others, because we never found any statement of accusation against `Umar (ra) in their main books.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, they did research the matter in their books but to them it was only considered to be one of the common differences of Fiqh among Ahlul-Sunnah and the Shia, even among Ahlul-Sunnah themselves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Second matter:<\/b> What are the proofs which led them to believe that `Umar (ra) did so?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All those who accused `Umar (ra) of adding this expression have used as evidence the narrations from Muwatta&#8217; Malik that we previously discussed, and here we shall begin discussing this accusation from their earliest books below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- &#8220;Kitab Sulaym bin Qays al-Hilali&#8221; by Sulaym bin Qays (died 76 AH), this book did not mention the accusation nor did it point to it, although it is supposedly written in a time near the time of `Umar (ra). This author heavily criticized the first two Khulafa&#8217;, Abu Bakr (ra) and `Umar (ra), he even wrote a chapter about `Umar (ra) called &#8220;Dropping a part of the Adhan&#8221;, he said on pg.231:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[As for what he dropped from the Adhan &#8220;Come to the best of deeds&#8221; they took this as a Sunnah after him and followed him in it.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The author mentioned that `Umar (ra) removed from the Adhan the expression &#8220;Hayy `ala Khayr-il-`Amal&#8221; but he never said anything about him adding &#8220;al-Salatu Khayrun min al-Nawm&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- &#8220;al-Idah&#8221; by al-Fadl bin Shadhan (died 260 AH), is one of the early and important Shia books, it did not mention `Umar (ra) adding anything to the Adhan nor did it quote the narration of the Muwatta&#8217;, he only said on pg.203 while addressing Ahlul-Sunnah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I truly wonder, that from among you are those who say in the Fajr Adhan and in the last `Isha&#8217;, between the Adhan and the Iqamah, after &#8220;Come to success&#8221;: &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221;, and some of you do not say it, and none of you criticize each-other for this?]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So he did not mention anything remotely related to `Umar (ra) adding the statement to the Adhan, he actually stated that Ahlul-Sunnah had differences of opinion in Fiqh and jurisprudence and they never had to resort to Taqiyyah in order to hide their opinions like the Shia Imams supposedly did.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then the late Muhaqqiq (6) of this book al-Sayyid Jalal-ul-Deen al-Husayni wrote in the footnotes the words of their scholar al-Majlisi (died 1110 AH) who accused `Umar (ra) of adding it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(6) Muhaqqiq: A Muhaqqiq of a book, is usually a late scholar who researches and comments on an old classical book written by an early scholar and adds information in the footnotes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- &#8220;al-Istighatha fil-Bida` il-Thalathah&#8221; by abu al-Qassim al-Kufi (died 352 AH) is a book that accused `Umar bin al-Khattab (ra) of adding the expression &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; but did not provide any evidence for it, it only hurled an accusation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[`Umar established &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; in the Adhan]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This vague book is the only early one that accused `Umar (ra) of adding this expression without proof from either Shia or Sunni sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Muhaqqiq of this book though, a contemporary Shia scholar, has placed a footnote on that same page quoting the narration of the Muwatta&#8217; and claiming it as proof, but it&#8217;s pointless because the original author never stated his evidence. The Muhaqqiq actually quotes the exact same passage from the book &#8220;al-Fusoul al-Muhimmah&#8221; by `Abdul-Husayn al-Musawi, as he says so himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the original author, this is what the Shia scholars of Rijal (7) said about him as reported in al-Khu&#8217;i&#8217;s &#8220;Mu`jam al-Rijal&#8221; 11\/263:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(7) Scholars of Rijal: Means the scholars who are knowledgeable in the field of narrators, they know the condition of each narrator, his biography and his reliability.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[al-Najashi said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ali bin Ahmad abu al-Qassim al-Kufi, a man from Kufa, used to say that he is from the descendants of abu Talib, he became from the Ghulat (8) at the end of his life, and his Madhab became corrupt, and he wrote many books, most were corrupt&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(8) Ghulu: Extremism, and a man from the Ghulat is a man who became an extremist in his beliefs to the point that he clearly deviated from truth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Sheikh al-Tusi said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was an Imami on the straight path, and he wrote many books &#8230; then he became confused and adopted the Madhab of the Mukhammisah, and he wrote many books full of Ghulu and confusion, some (deviant) beliefs are attributed to him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-`Allamah said at the end of the man&#8217;s biography:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The meaning of Takhmis(Mukhammisah) in the Madhab of the Ghulat may Allah curse them, is that Allah handed the provisions and affairs of the people to: Salman al-Farisi, al-Miqdad, `Ammar, abu Dharr and `Amro bin Umayyah al-Dumari, may Allah be elevated above this greatly!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ibn al-Ghada&#8217;iri said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Claims to be from `Alawite descent but is an extremist and a liar, a man of innovations and deviant sayings, I saw many books for him but they are to be ignored.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- ibn Babaweih al-Qummi al-Saduq (died 381 AH) who was relatively close to that period, did not mention in his books, which numbered around three hundred, anything to point that `Umar bin al-Khattab (ra) added anything to the Adhan, nor did he speak about the narration in Muwatta&#8217; Malik.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- al-Mufid (died 413 AH) in his books that numbered a hundred and ninety four, although he wrote loads of criticism against `Umar (ra) and the Sahaba (ra) in general, he did not mention this accusation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- al-Sayyid al-Murtada (died 436 AH) in his book al-Shafi fil-Imamah, under the chapter &#8220;criticisms against `Umar&#8221;, did not mention this accusation, although he mentioned that he forbade the two Mut`ahs, and that he invented the Taraweeh prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7-al-Sheikh al-Tusi (died 460 AH) did not mention anything related to this as well in his book &#8220;Talkhees al-Shafi&#8221; which is a summary of al-Murtada&#8217;s book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his other books, &#8220;Masa&#8217;il al-Nasiriyat&#8221;, &#8220;al-Intisar&#8221;, &#8220;Masa&#8217;il al-Murtada&#8221; and &#8220;al-Nihayah&#8221; he also never mentioned it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his book &#8220;al-Khilaf&#8221; he discussed that the matter of Tathweeb like he discussed any other difference of opinion between Ahlul-Sunnah and the Shia, without mentioning `Umar (ra) or the narration of the Muwatta&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, in &#8220;al-Khilaf&#8221; 1\/95, al-Tusi proves `Umar&#8217;s (ra) innocence by quoting this narration: It is narrated that once his Mu&#8217;adhin abu Mahdhourah (ra) came to him after he had done the original Adhan, and said to him &#8220;Prayer O chief of believers, Come to prayer, Come to prayer, Come to Success, Come to Success&#8221; so `Umar (ra) said to him &#8220;Stop! are you a mad man!? Was your first call not sufficient for us to realize that we must come!?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This shows that `Umar (ra) rejected any addition to the call to prayer that was not originally found in it, and was very clear that he wants absolutely nothing added to its original text.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- abu al-Salah al-Halabi (died 447 AH) in his book &#8220;Taqreeb al-Ma`arif&#8221; pg.334, included a chapter titled: &#8220;Mentioning the hideous acts that they -Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman- committed which cancel their leadership&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this chapter he mentioned everything he can get his hands on concerning `Umar (ra), such as his prohibition of the Mut`ah of women, and the Mut`ah of Hajj, and his prohibition of increasing the dowry, and inventing the prayer of Taraweeh and so on&#8230; but never mentioned the narration of the Muwatta&#8217; or anything related to Adhan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- Nasir-ul-Deen al-Tusi (died 672 AH) the author of &#8220;Tajreed al-I`tiqad&#8221; mentioned many criticisms against `Umar (ra) such as him ordering the stoning of a pregnant woman or forbidding Mut`ah, but nothing related to Adhan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even those who wrote summaries of al-Tusi&#8217;s book, never mentioned this accusation, such as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Helli (died 726 AH) in &#8220;Kashf-ul-Murad fi Sharh Tajreed al-I`tiqad.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">or Shams-ul-Deen al-Asfahani (died 746 AH) in his Sharh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">or the Sharh by al-Qushaji (died 879 AH).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10- The book &#8220;Nahj-ul-Haqq wa Kashf-ul-Sidq&#8221; by al-`Allamah al-Helli (died 726 AH) wrote a chapter titled &#8220;The criticisms reported by Ahlul-Sunnah towards `Umar bin al-Khattab&#8221;, in this book he wrote every single thing he could get his hands on regarding `Umar (ra) even very rare opinions, and it was stated in this book that every accusation was documented from the books of Hadith and history and Seerah so that the reader may refer to it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So he said on pg.351:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And he added after the death of the Prophet &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But he did not write down the source of this accusation as opposed to what was promised, although he wrote down the sources of all other accusations. So all that the poor contemporary Muhaqqiq of this book could do was refer us to the narration of the Muwatta&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for his other books such as &#8220;Muntaha al-Matlab&#8221;, &#8220;Minhaj al-Karamah&#8221;, &#8220;Mukhtalaf al-Shia&#8221;, \u00a0&#8220;Tadhkirat-ul-Huffaz&#8221;, &#8220;Tahrir al-Ahkam&#8221;, &#8220;Nihayat al-Ahkam&#8221; and &#8220;Tabsirat al-Muta`allimeen&#8221; he never mentioned this accusation while criticizing `Umar (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11-The book &#8220;al-Sirat-ul-Mustaqeem&#8221; by `Ali al-Bayadi (died 877 AH) also never mentioned\u00a0 the accusation, while knowing that he mentioned `Umar (ra) removing the expression &#8220;Come to the best of deeds&#8221;, and he mentioned many criticisms such as making three divorces in one, or protecting al-Mugheerah, or the congregational Taraweeh, or the Duha prayer ect&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">12-The book &#8220;Bihar al-Anwar&#8221; by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (died 1111 AH), is a one hundred and ten volumes book, among them are four volumes of criticisms against the companions (ra), there is even a two hundred sixty four page chapter called:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;The Kufr of the three -Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman- and their hypocrisy and scandalous acts and ugly traditions, and the virtues of disowning them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He filled this chapter with cursing them and insulting them and calling them names.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Under it is a chapter called &#8220;Detailing the flaws of `Umar and using them as arguments against the opponents.&#8221; it is a hundred and sixty two pages, and in it he mentioned that `Umar (ra) added Tathweeb to the Adhan and his only proof was the narration of the Muwatta&#8217; that he quoted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">13- The book &#8220;al-Ghadeer&#8221; by al-Amini (died 1390 AH), who collected as much as he could in this eleven volume book from the books of Ahlul-Sunnah, and he wrote two hundred and fifty pages in criticism of `Umar (ra), trying to show that he is an innovator, and that he was ignorant about the religious laws and rulings&#8230; but he never mentioned the accusation about `Umar (ra) adding Tathweeb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many other major Shia scholars and major books that did not mention `Umar (ra) adding to the Adhan but we will not mention them so as to not bore the reader, for a short list of these books, please refer to the original Arabic book by the brother `Ala&#8217;-ul-Deen al-Baseer. However, what we mentioned above are the main books of Fiqh and `Aqidah of the Twelver Shia sect, and one can notice that all the early Shia had no knowledge of `Umar (ra) adding anything nor were they familiar with the narration from Muwatta&#8217; Malik or its interpretation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We conclude from this, that this Shia accusation was put together by the late Shia scholars not their early ones, it was not known by the masters of their sect such as ibn Shadhan or Tusi or Mufid or Saduq or Murtada, it was first mentioned by an extremist liar called abu al-Qassim al-Kufi with no proof to back it, later it was mentioned in the eight century by al-Helli also without any sources. The first Shia to claim that `Umar (ra) added it and using the tradition found in Muwatta&#8217; Malik to prove this was al-Majlisi in the twelfth century and all the rest of the Shia scholars followed his example like parrots.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen al-Musawi clings to a very weak argument by every standard, simply to attack `Umar (ra), the man has no shame or respect for academic research, and if Ahlul-Sunnah found any evidence showing that `Umar (ra) did add such an expression, they would have openly stated it without fear just as they admitted that `Uthman (ra) added the third Adhan of Friday prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end I would like to mention a Shia narration related to this topic, it is narrated by al-Imam al-Kazim in &#8220;Asl Zayd al-Nursi&#8221; a part of &#8220;al-Usoul al-Sitta-`Ashar&#8221; pg.54, that he said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[&#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; is the innovation of the Umayyads and is not a part of the Adhan, and there is no harm if anyone wishes to call people by it to wake them for prayer but he should not make it a part of the Adhan as we do not see it as such.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What choice will the Shia scholars make? will they take the weak Sunni narration? or one of their own Shia narrations and the words of their infallible leaders? apparently their hatred for `Umar (ra) was so great that they slammed the word of their infallible against the wall and took the narration from Muwatta&#8217; Malik. Although Allah ordered us not to oppress our brothers, the Almighty ordered us not to even oppress Ahlul-Kitab:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes &#8211; from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.} [60:8]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is as if the Shia forget verses like this one when it comes to the companions and wives of our Prophet (SAWS):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do.} [5:8]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Writing history according to their desires:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way of the Shia since their first appearance was a twisted one, it is a twisted reading of history that reflected negatively on their writings, which are in turn based on following their desires when it comes to accepting a narration or rejecting it. They pick the books that back up their views, and from these books they hand pick the narrations that benefit them, and from these narrations they take only the parts that suit them, and finally they interpret those parts in ways that agree to their twisted understanding of history. Also from their way, is to accept the version of history that suits them regardless of authenticity, they would pick the fabricated narration even if it is contradicted by many authentic ones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why their version of history is a dark and depressing one, where the first generation of Islam and best of men were turned to a bunch of thieves and hypocrites, where the great conquests of Islam were pictured as the evil ambitions of these men, and that their purpose was only to expand their influence and enjoy material wealth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Ja`far Murtada al-`Amili and &#8220;Tathweeb&#8221;:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This so called Sayyid Ja`far al-`Amili has accused the chief of believers `Umar ibn al-Khattab (ra) of adding Tathweeb to the Adhan in his books. However, he himself has rejected many historical narrations that do not suit his desires and do not agree with his Madhab, he said in his book &#8220;al-Madkhal li-Dirasat al-Seerah&#8221; pg.11:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[The one who intends to study history and benefit from historical books, has to read them with caution and awareness, so that he does not fall as a victim of misguidance.

And any narration that goes against his personal views and biases, becomes from those that have been tampered by desires and tainted by extreme bias.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This man has discussed the matter of Tathweeb, so we will now show you that he didn&#8217;t apply his own standards nor did he follow this methodology that he wrote down for us in the beginning of his book, instead he followed the desires of his companions who preceded him in their hatred for `Umar (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is as Allah said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do?} [61:2]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ja`far al-`Amili comments on the following narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From Bilal, that he was making the Adhan of the morning, and he would say &#8220;Come to the best of deeds&#8221; so the messenger (SAWS) ordered that he replace it with &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-`Amili comments in &#8220;al-Sahih min al-Seerah&#8221;, 4\/284:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[As for the last part of the narration, it is apparently an addition by the narrators because the expression &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; was added some time after the Prophet&#8217;s death, specifically by `Umar bin al-Khattab as many narrations state.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truly as Allah said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil?

No one knows. We will see later that another Shia scholar `Ali al-Milani will use a different technique, he will simply erase the last part of the narration when quoting it. Whereas, another of their scholars called Ja`far al-Subhani, will quote this narration but his technique is to ignore it and not comment on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now the reader is wondering, what are those many sources that al-`Amili listed? The answer is that the only source he listed was the same old narration from Muwatta&#8217; Malik, and all other sources don&#8217;t mention anything related to `Umar (ra) adding the expression to prayer, as for the sources whose page numbers were not mentioned, he didn&#8217;t mention them as they contain authentic narrations proving that Tathweeb is a prophetic Sunnah, in other words he is fooling the readers!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, just to show you I will go through some of these sources:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Muwatta&#8217; Malik 1\/93:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contains the weak narration that we discussed previously.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Musannaf `Abdul-Razzaq #1827:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It states that Bilal (ra) added it during the time of Abu Bakr (ra) after he heard it from some man. `Umar (ra) asked him to stop this innovation!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Musannaf `Abdul-Razzaq #1829:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It states that the first to invent the Tathweeb was Sa`d during the Khilafah of `Umar (ra), and he said &#8220;It is an innovation&#8221; and he left it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Musannaf `Abdul-Razzaq #1832:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Umar&#8217;s son (ra) heard a man making Tathweeb in a mosque so he said &#8220;Let&#8217;s leave this innovator alone!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So as the reader can see, none of these narrations accuse `Umar (ra), in fact one accuses Bilal (ra) and the other accuses Sa`d (ra). Keep in mind that in the same book there are narrations in which both Bilal (ra) and abu Mahdhourah (ra) said that this was an order from the Prophet (SAWS), such as narration #1824, #1823, and even the son of `Umar (ra) used to do it in #1822.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Sunan al-Daraqutni:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contains several narrations stating that it was an order from the Prophet (SAWS). Nothing about `Umar (ra) inventing this expression.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And so on and so forth&#8230; there is absolutely no proof whatsoever for their claim that `Umar (ra) added it, except what is narrated in al-Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik and is disconnected and weak&#8230; yet they will use this pathetic narration just in order to attack `Umar (ra)!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ja`far al-`Amili says in another book &#8220;Mukhtasar Mufid As&#8217;ilah wa Ajwibah fil-Deen&#8221; 9\/37:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[That reporting a narration about a matter, does not mean that the one who reported it accepts its content, especially if he reports what opposes it.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how is it then, that in our case there are plenty of strong narrations, even entire chapters to oppose this claim, yet the Shia will stick to that one narration out of hatred for the Sahabah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actually one can refer to &#8220;al-Mughni&#8221; by ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi, vol.1, pg.211 to see that Imam Malik was from those who considered Tathweeb a prophetic Sunnah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Murtada al-`Askari and &#8220;Tathweeb&#8221;:<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way of the Shia is to cling to any random weak narration and make it an undisputed historical fact if it happens to agree with their beliefs and if it supports their case against the companions of the Prophet (SAWS).

As it is not established historically that any of their Imams wrote even one book of Hadith, Tafseer, Tareekh or `Aqeedah. On the other hand, those who lived during the time of the Imams, from the scholars of Ahlul-Sunnah, have written many books and volumes, the second century did not end until most religious sciences were matured, they even wrote books to refute deviant sects and religions like Zoroastrians and Buddhists and Christians and so on&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Isn&#8217;t it from the duties of the Imams to preserve religion from being lost, or tampered? Why did those infallible Imams make us rely on the narrations of non-infallible people like Zurarah and Jabir al-Ju`fi and Sahl bin Ziyad? And why did they allow them to rely on non-infallible people like Kulayni and Tusi and Saduq to write them down in book form?

It is also narrated by another group of scholars who are too numerous to mention.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First of all, the part which says &#8220;I say&#8221;, these are not the words of al-Musawi, they are the words of the same Sunni scholar al-Zarqani taken from another paragraph that al-Musawi did not wish to quote. al-Musawi just wanted to give his readers the impression that they were his words, so they&#8217;d\u00a0 think the man put some effort in his search for truth, although he is far from it removed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What `Abdul-Husayn did not mention from al-Zarqani&#8217;s words was the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I do not know that this was narrated from `Umar in any authentic way, it was only reported by ibn abi Shaybah from the Hadith of Hisham ibn `Urwah, from a man called Isma`eel and I do not know who he is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Tathweeb is established in the Adhan of Bilal, and ibn abi Mahdhourah when they would do it in the morning prayers with the Prophet (SAWS).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The meaning of this narration here, is that this expression must be announced only in the Adhan of the morning, not like the Mu&#8217;adhin did it, he (`Umar) disliked that there would be a different call on the door of the leader, as some leaders would later do. Otherwise, Tathweeb is popular among the scholars and laypeople, and it cannot be that `Umar (ra) did not know of what the Prophet (SAWS) had ordered his two Mu&#8217;adhins, Bilal in Madinah and abu Mahdhourah in Makkah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was also an explanation by al-Baji, who said that it is possible that `Umar refused that the Mu&#8217;adhin would use an expression from the expressions of Adhan outside of it, so he ordered him to keep it within the Adhan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has been narrated by ibn Majah, from the route of ibn al-Musayyib, from Bilal, that he came to the Prophet (SAWS) to make Adhan for him in Fajr, so they told him &#8220;He is asleep.&#8221; he said: Prayer is better than sleep, twice.

However, if one made this call in his village, in a secluded or isolated place (where no one can hear him), then it is allowed for him to leave it but it is preferable if he did not leave it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malik from his uncle abu Suhayl ibn Malik, from his father Malik bin `Amir al-Asbahi, that he said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since I first became aware, the only matter that they did -The Sahaba- and still remains unchanged is the call to prayer, it remained as it was and no change came to it, as opposed to the prayer because it was delayed from its rightful times, and change crept into many of the actions, a lot from enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is gone even if the people knew them, as al-Baji said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn `Abdul-Barr said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Adhan did not change from how it first was.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Ata&#8217; said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I do not know that the Adhan of today differs from their Adhan in the past, even though many things\u00a0 are different today than they were during the time of the four Caliphs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And some who do not accept the opinions of the people of Madinah used this as an argument, and said that the only argument is what was reported with the authentic chains from the Prophet (SAWS) and the four Caliphs and those who followed their way.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: Sharh al-Zarqani `ala Muwatta&#8217; al-Imam Malik, by Muhammad al-Zarqani, vol.1, pg.150.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is truly shocking, the amount of dishonesty the Shia scholar has. He only quoted one sentence from al-Zarqani, out of context, and left all the rest of the paragraph which mentions the following points:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- The narration accusing `Umar (ra) was weak in terms of the chain of transmission.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- The narration of `Umar (ra) can easily be given another interpretation that does not oppose all other narrations on Tathweeb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep.&#8221; was a part of the Adhan since the time of the Prophet (SAWS) as narrated by his two Mu&#8217;adhins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Imam Malik himself is of the opinion that Tathweeb is a Sunnah and it is disliked to leave it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- The major early scholars all agree that Adhan was among the things that were unchanged, not even slightly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the narration from Musannaf Waki` in which `Umar (ra) tells his Mu&#8217;adhin to announce Tathweeb in the morning call, that can easily be given the following interpretation: `Umar (ra) reminded his old Mu&#8217;adhin or informed his new Mu&#8217;adhin that reciting Tathweeb in Fajr is a Sunnah, so he must do\u00a0 it. It doesn&#8217;t say he invented it or added something that was not already there, so it&#8217;s unacceptable as an argument and is completely different than the narration of Muwatta&#8217; Malik.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">`Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen al-Musawi says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[It is also narrated by another group of scholars who are too numerous to mention.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And he placed a footnote under it:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Review al-Wasa&#8217;il, vol.4, pg.642 &#8211; Chapters of Adhan and Iqamah &#8211; chapter 19]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: After al-Musawi felt that he did not have much proofs, and that his argument was weak, and he lost hope in trying to find new sources, although he threw every arrow in his possession. al-Musawi resorted to deceive his readers and said: &#8220;Also narrated by another group of scholars who are too numerous to mention.&#8221; He said it to fool the readers into thinking that it&#8217;s actually true.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest proof we have that this man is a liar, is his own book, review his book and see for yourself that he fills the pages of his books with as many sources and quotes as he can, even in the smallest matters, you will find page after page of sources and quotes even if they are sometimes completely irrelevant! But in our case, he knows he has no more proofs except for that one narration, so he simply says &#8220;They&#8217;re too numerous to mention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After this hypocrite scholar died, his followers wanted to save him from his shame, so one of the contemporary Shia Dr.`Abdul-Jabbar Shararah volunteered to become the Muhaqqiq of `Abdul-Husayn&#8217;s book, and when he reached this part of the book he was dumbfounded, he had absolutely nothing to write in the footnotes, there was no &#8220;other group of scholars&#8221; nor was there any mention of this in the books of Ahlul-Sunnah! So what can this poor man do? He can&#8217;t say his master is wrong, after all the Shia granted their Ayatullahs a level near infallibility, so what can the poor doctor do?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr.`Abdul-Jabbar, found that the only solution to save his master&#8217;s reputation, was to act like a confused mule, and refer the readers in the footnotes to the book &#8220;al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221;. This O dear reader is the famous Shia book &#8220;Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah&#8221; by their scholar al-Hurr al-`Amili!! There was no &#8220;group of scholars who are too numerous to count&#8221; nor was there any narrations in the books of Ahlul-Sunnah, so he decided to refer us to a Shia book that isn&#8217;t even relied upon by the Shia themselves!! By doing so, admitting that his master `Abdul-Husayn Sharaf-ul-Deen al-Musawi was a big liar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This isn&#8217;t the end of it however.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia source that he referred us to, also has nothing to do with `Umar (ra) adding an expression to the Adhan. If the reader checks the chapter of Adhan and Iqamah in Kitab al-Salat from Wasa&#8217;il al-Shia, he will see that the author collected twenty five narrations, that inform us about the text of the Adhan which the Shia supposedly narrated from their Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What we conclude, is that the author of the book and the Muhaqqiq of the book, both of these Shia scholars are dishonest deceivers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still this isn&#8217;t the end of it!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When checking that chapter which the deceiver referred us to, \u00a0we will see that in four of the narrations, the Imams themselves announce &#8220;Prayer is better than sleep&#8221; as being part of the Adhan! We will cover these in the coming pages Insha-Allah.
