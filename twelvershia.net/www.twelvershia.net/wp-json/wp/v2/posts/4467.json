See below.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why Thirteen?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reports that indicate that the Im\u0101ms were thirteen do not seem to be based upon any ideological basis, for there was no early \u201cThirteener\u201d Movement. Unlike the reports that indicate that the Im\u0101ms are twelve, the reports above, are not ideologically driven. It is very possible that one of these reports was concocted with an arbitrary number and that it went on to spawn multiple had\u012bths.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given the fact that the book of Sulaym included the number thirteen, it is safe to say that this number most likely predated the number twelve, since Sulaym was a <em>tabi\u2019\u012b<\/em>, who passed away in the first century of Islam.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Correcting the Im\u0101ms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise that each and every one of the six points provided above has been in a way \u201ccorrected\u201d, in order to fit with the Twelver narrative.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had previously analyzed examples #1 and #5 previously,<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]<\/a> and I have concluded that these late distortions appear to have occurred at the hands of \u201cAl-\u1e62ad\u016bq\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Report #2 was tampered with multiple times in the works of Ibn B\u0101b\u016byah,<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]<\/a> where the words \u201cfrom her descendants\u201d were removed. However, Ibn B\u0101b\u016byah also quotes it with the same wording as Al-K\u0101f\u012b in some of his other works,<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]<\/a> which indicate that these reports were manipulated by someone else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrations #3 and #4 were tampered with as well. Both can be found in the <em>asl<\/em> of `Abb\u0101d Al-`Usfur\u012b<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]<\/a> with the number \u201celeven\u201d replacing the number \u201ctwelve\u201d. Even though the <em>asl<\/em> predates Al-K\u0101f\u012b, the original manuscript was written in 374 AH by Man\u1e63\u016br bin Al-\u1e24asan bin Al-\u1e24usayn Al-\u0100b\u012b, fifty years after Al-Kulayn\u012b. Furthermore, there is absolutely no reason for Al-Kulayn\u012b to sabotage the had\u012bths of `Abb\u0101d, while it is favorable for the copyist to do so. However, one cannot be certain as to whether these distortions occurred at the hands of Al-\u0100b\u012b, for it may have occurred by an earlier narrator or perhaps a later copyist. Naturally, we can be reassured that Al-K\u0101f\u012b\u2019s wordings are more representative of what `Abb\u0101d had originally written.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Number of Im\u0101ms in the Book of Sulaym<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally we come to the report of Sulaym bin Qays in his book, which according to Ibn Al-Gha\u1e0da`ir\u012b, advocated that the number of Im\u0101ms are thirteen.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]<\/a> He denounces the book as a forgery due to this as well as other reasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hibatull\u0101h bin A\u1e25mad bin Mo\u1e25ammad Al-K\u0101tib, propagated this belief based on the contents of the book of Sulaym. He was the grandson of one of the emissaries of the Mahd\u012b, who authored a work in which he claimed that the Im\u0101ms were thirteen, and included Zayd bin `Al\u012b as one of them. He relied on a had\u012bth that stated that \u201cthe Im\u0101ms from the descendants of `Al\u012b are twelve,\u201d which could be found in the book of Sulaym. Hibatull\u0101h passed away in the fifth century. Al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b, who provides us with this biographical information, puts no effort into correcting Hibatull\u0101h\u2019s usage of the report in the book of Sulaym. <a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Muf\u012bd<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]<\/a> is not explicit about the number of Im\u0101ms, however, he does state that the book should not be relied upon, apparently due to hidden manipulations. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Al-Muf\u012bd held this opinion due to the reasons held by Ibn Al-Gha\u1e0d\u0101`ir\u012b.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, in modern prints of the book of Sulaym today, we find that the number of Im\u0101ms is clearly twelve. Mo\u1e25ammad B\u0101qir Al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b, the editor of the book, quotes 24 instances in which they are numbered as twelve.<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]<\/a> Is it possible that Ibn Al-Gha\u1e0d\u0101`ir\u012b, Hibatull\u0101h Al-K\u0101tib, and by extension Al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b all overlooked these instances?<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It appears as though the case for Thirteen Im\u0101ms was one that was lost in time due to both the strength of the Twelver movement, as well as the manipulations in the had\u012bths. These manipulations would have most likely occurred during the <em>ghaybah<\/em> period, after the passing away of Al-\u1e24asan Al-`Askar\u012b, to support the Twelver ideology that only finally evolved into that form by the middle of the third century.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> Al-K\u0101f\u012b 1\/531<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> Al-K\u0101f\u012b 1\/533<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> Ba\u1e63\u0101`ir Al-Daraj\u0101t p. 340<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\">[4]<\/a> Al-K\u0101f\u012b 1\/532<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\">[5]<\/a> Al-Ghaybah p. 139<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\">[6]<\/a> Al-K\u0101f\u012b 1\/534<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\">[7]<\/a> Al-K\u0101f\u012b 1\/534<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref8\" name=\"_ftn8\">[8]<\/a> Al-Istin\u1e63\u0101r 7-A<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref9\" name=\"_ftn9\">[9]<\/a> Distortions of Al-\u1e62ad\u016bq p. 25, 28<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref10\" name=\"_ftn10\">[10]<\/a> `Uy\u016bn Akhb\u0101r Al-Ri\u1e0d\u0101 1\/52, Kam\u0101l Al-D\u012bn p. 311, p. 313<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref11\" name=\"_ftn11\">[11]<\/a> Man L\u0101 Ya\u1e25\u1e0darhu Al-Faq\u012bh 4\/180, Al-Khi\u1e63\u0101l p. 478<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref12\" name=\"_ftn12\">[12]<\/a> Al-Us\u016bl Al-Sittatu `Ashar p. 139-140<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref13\" name=\"_ftn13\">[13]<\/a> Al-Rij\u0101l p. 63<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref14\" name=\"_ftn14\">[14]<\/a> Rij\u0101l Al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b p. 440<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref15\" name=\"_ftn15\">[15]<\/a> Mu\u1e63anaf\u0101t Al-Shaykh Al-Muf\u012bd 5\/149<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#_ftnref16\" name=\"_ftn16\">[16]<\/a> Kit\u0101b Sulaym 1\/173-179<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>It may come as a surprise to many Sh\u012bas, that there are multiple had\u012bths in the classical Sh\u012ba works that speak of thirteen Im\u0101ms instead of twelve.
