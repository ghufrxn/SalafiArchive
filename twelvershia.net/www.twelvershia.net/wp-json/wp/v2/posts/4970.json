If Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b\u2019s intention from the comparison was to demonstrate the permissibility of recitation as per the meaning, then such a matter could have been explained using any other statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, the <em>tashahud<\/em> is unlike most other religious rulings, since multiple variations of it have been taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b explains that the multiple <em>Qira\u2019\u0101t<\/em> are a mercy from Allah in order to facilitate its memorization. If the Qur`\u0101n was limited to one form in recitation, it would be a struggle for a non-Qurash\u012b to memorize it. Hence, the existence of <em>Qira\u2019\u0101t<\/em>, through the seven modes, which mainly include dialectal differences, provides ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that much of the <em>Qira\u2019\u0101t<\/em> have nothing to do with the dialects of the Arab tribes and are incompatible with Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b\u2019s statements above. Some of these examples will be examined below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-synonymous Recitations<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Al-K\u016br\u0101n\u012b\u2019s quotations above are used in order to argue that Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b believed in interchangeable synonyms, this doesn\u2019t explain the existence of variants with different meanings. Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b, aware of the recitation of <em>wa<\/em> <em>arjulikum<\/em> in Q 5:6, comments, \u201cWe read it as <em>arjulakum<\/em>, meaning: Wash your face, hands, and feet.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn17\">[17]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b speaks of his preference without critiquing the other recitation as a false one, which demonstrates that he is aware of the validity of variances that do not have the same meaning. In other words, the seven <em>a\u1e25ruf<\/em> are not limited to synonyms as per the view of Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b. This conflicts directly with Al-K\u016br\u0101n\u012b\u2019s understanding of the quotations that he provided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Taqd\u012bm wa Ta\u2019kh\u012br<\/em><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of the <em>a\u1e25ruf<\/em> include additions, omissions, non-synonymous changes, as well as <em>taqd<\/em><em>\u012b<\/em><em>m wa ta\u2019kh<\/em><em>\u012b<\/em><em>r <\/em>(anastrophe), in which a variant includes the same words of a verse but in a different order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Uthmanic recitation of Q 50:9: \u201cAnd the stupor of death with bring truth,\u201d was revealed in one <em>\u1e25<\/em><em>arf<\/em> as \u201cand the stupor of truth will bring death.\u201d Of course, the latter was not accommodated into the Uthmanic <em>rasm<\/em> and is not read today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The example above is clear in the sense that the variant <em>a\u1e25ruf<\/em> are not necessarily synonymous.
