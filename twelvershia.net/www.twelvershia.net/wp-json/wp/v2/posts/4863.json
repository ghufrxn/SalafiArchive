I am personally not aware of one that is \nmore appealing to storytellers than the martyrdom of al-\u1e24usayn. For his \nmartyrdom was truly a tragedy that has caused tears to flow and \nuprisings to erupt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, another disaster is that the martyrdom of al-\u1e24usayn has \ndevolved into a Greek tragedy, one that pushes away those that are \nrational, due to the fabrications and distortions that have tarnished \nhis great image. Does al-\u1e24usayn need fabricators to make him great?! Is \nhe not a leader of the youth of paradise?! If that is the case, then it \nis high time we strip ourselves from our subjective preconceptions and \nlearn of his history through an academic lens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book, as short as it may be, shall be sufficient for the reader,  for the lengthy versions are riddled with fabrications. If Allah wills,  this book will provide the reader with a clear perspective of what  exactly transpired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can purchase the book on this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/daralarqam.bigcartel.com\/product\/the-martyrdom-of-al-husayn-in-light-of-the-authentic-traditions\" rel=\"external nofollow\">https:\/\/daralarqam.bigcartel.com\/product\/the-martyrdom-of-al-husayn-in-light-of-the-authentic-traditions<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This book provides an historical rendition of the events which culminated within Karbala.
