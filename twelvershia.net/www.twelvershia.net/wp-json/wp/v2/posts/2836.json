A lot of the other reports are transmitted through unreliable intermediaries, such as \u201ca man\u201d (see hadith #16, #21, #22, #23, #25, #26, #29, #33) or \u201csomeone\u201d (see hadith #4, #5, #27, #28, #30, #32, #36, #44).<\/li>\n<li>Nawadir Ali b.

Sa\u2019id used to purposely lie upon my father, and he used to acquire the books of my father\u2019s companions. Al-Mughirah\u2019s companions, who were disguised among my father\u2019s companions, used to acquire the books from my father\u2019s companions. They then used to offer them to Al-Mughirah, who would proceed to insert <em>kufr<\/em> and <em>zandaqah<\/em> into them, and then he would ascribe that to my father. He then used to give the books to his companions and command them to disseminate them among the Shia. Thus, any of the <em>ghuluww<\/em> found in the books of my father\u2019s companions was inserted by Al-Mughirah b.

The forged and distorted books of the imams\u2019 companions seemed to have been widely circulated among the Shia. This is clear in Yunus b. \u2018Abdurrahman\u2019s report, where he mentioned that he had acquired books from Abu \u2018Abdillah\u2019s companions in Iraq only to later discover that much of them was fabricated.<\/p>\n<p>Asides from the questionable authorship and unreliable transmission of these books, the widespread tampering that has occurred with these documents further detracts from their historical value.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>What About the Other 384 <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not much is known about the remaining 384 <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.islam4u.com\/ar\/almojib\/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%9F#footnote13_1far7g9\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Agha Buzurgh Tehrani<\/a>, however, listed the names of 126 <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>, most of which are extinct.

Some of Agha Buzurgh\u2019s commentary has further confirmed our conclusions.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Asides from the obscure authorship of a variety of these <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>, some of the authors of these books were liars, forgers and non-Twelvers who have been cursed by the Imams. Al-Tusi, in his <em>Fihrist<\/em>, mentioned that \u2018Ali b.

Rather, they were only called \u201c<em>Us\u016bl<\/em>\u201d by later figures, such as Ibn Tawus (d. 664), Al-Shaheed Al-Thani (d. 965), or Al-Hurr Al-Ameli (d. 1104).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>See the descriptions of the <em>Us\u016bl<\/em> of Aban b.

Ziyad (d. 310).<\/li>\n<li>Some of the authors of these <em>Us\u016bl<\/em> were not known for authoring an <em>Asl<\/em>. They were only included in the list because a figure, at one point, referred to \u201can <em>Asl<\/em> of their work\u201d, meaning, a copy or a manuscript of their work. See the biographies of Ali b. Ahmad b. Abi Al-Qasim, Ali b. Isma\u2019eel bin Shu\u2019aib, and Ali b. Abdulwahid, in Al-Dharee\u2019ah by Agha Buzurgh.<\/li>\n<li>Early Shi\u2019ite biographers and historiographers, such Al-Najashi, were often not aware of whether certain books were Us\u016bl or not. In the biography of Marwak b. \u2018Ubaid (p. 425), Al-Najashi briefly describes Marwak\u2019s book, <em>Al-Nawadir<\/em>, saying: \u00a0\u201cOur Qommi companions say that it is one of the <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This quote indicates that that Al-Najashi was not fully aware of the book\u2019s status such that he quoted unnamed authorities to describe the book. It also indicates that there wasn\u2019t necessarily a consensus regarding the status of a book as an <em>Asl<\/em>.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>The author of the list cited above, Salih Al-Kirbasi, deceptively attempts to inflate the number of <em>Us\u016bl.<\/em> As stated above, the <em>Us\u016bl<\/em> were compiled by four hundred traditionists, and the author of the article has included 126 names. Numbers 47-50 are all authored by Hareez b. Abdullah Al-Sijistani, while numbers 63 to 66 were all authoted by Hafs b. Abdullah Al-Sijistani. The names of the books attributed to both figures are identical, which is natural because the name \u201cHafs\u201d merely is a copyist error. In other words, Al-Kirbasi attempted to expand his list to 126 books, when it actually should have consisted of 118 books.<\/li>\n<li>Copyist errors in manuscripts often led to the assumption that certain books were <em>Us\u016bl<\/em>. Agha Buzurgh mentioned that certain manuscripts of Al-Fihrist by Al-Tusi would sometimes refer to a <em>Kitab<\/em> as an <em>Asl<\/em> and vice versa. See the biographies of Isma\u2019il b.
