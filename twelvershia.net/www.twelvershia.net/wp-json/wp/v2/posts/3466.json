In this article, we will be taking a look at the source of exaggerations that played a role in shaping of the Shia view of the history of Karbala.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to give the readers a clear view of what has led to these developments in the history of Karbala, we have split this article as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Abu Mikhnaf and his Role in Shaping the History of Karbala<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Manuscripts of Maqtal Al-Hussain that have been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The Published Editions of Maqtal Al-Hussain that has been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Introduction about the book Maqtal Al-Hussain<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Al-Jbouri\u2019s Refutation to those that accept the commonly Distributed Book<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Abbas Al-Qummi View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi\u2019s View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abu Mikhnaf and his Role in Shaping the History of Karbala<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may come as a surprise to most Shias that the vast majority of their views comes through what revolves around one man. Abu Mikhnaf Lut bin Yahya, was a second century historian that documented the history of Karbala. However, his book did not survive and Shias had to rely on another book for the history of Karbala. Strangely, that other book is also attributed to Abu Mikhnaf, and his words are used by all modern lecturers and authors that have wrote about the history of Karbala.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To give an idea to the readers as to how much this erroneous version has been circulated, we provided quotes from an expert on the topic of Karbala, the Shia historian Kamil Al-Jbouri:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Manuscripts of Maqtal Al-Hussain that have been attributed to Abi Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kamil Al-Jbouri states (p. 32-34):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maqtal Al-Hussain has many manuscripts that can be found in the storage facilities of the world.

He passed away in the year 157 AH. Most of the books of biographies and indexes have mentioned his book \u201cMaqtal Al-Hussain\u201d. Al-Najashi mentioned it in his book of biographies p. 245. Ibn Al-Nadeem mentioned it in his Fihrist p. 136. Al-Tusi mentioned it in his Fihrist p. 155. Yaqoot Al-Hamawi mentioned it in his Mu\u2019jam Al-Udaba\u2019 17\/41. Ibn Shakir mentioned it in his Fawat Al-Wafiyaat 3\/225.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aforementioned book, Maqtal Al-Hussain \u2013 peace be onto him &#8211; , which was quoted by and relied upon by the great scholars of old is now lost. This is the case with the rest of his (Abu Mikhnaf\u2019s) books. All that is left are fragments that can be found here and there in books of history and narrations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for that which we find in front of us that has been attributed to him, then it is not by him. Not only that, but it is not by any of the relied upon historians. For it contains many narrations that Abu Mikhnaf had [no] idea about and are falsely attributed to the man. There are many that have lied upon him, which is evidence of his greatness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evidences of this falsehood are that the language used is not the language of his times and it contains grammatical mistakes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we were to assume that the origin of this narration is by Abi Mikhnaf, then the one that we find, which has been attributed to him, has gone through late revisions. These revisions of the text, with time led to more revisions, until the text became irrelevant to the author\u2019s original. Though, some truth in it, and in some areas texts that have not changed, and this is the view of Wustenfeld when he studied the two texts which were popular at that time \u201cMaqtal Al-Hussain\u201d and \u201cAl-Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for what has been documented by Al-Tabari about Maqtal Al-Hussain \u2013 peace be onto him &#8211; , in which he quotes from Abu Mikhnaf, and that what we find in this attributed book, we find that there is a similarity in both, especially in historical matters.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Al-Jbouri\u2019s Refutation to those that accept the commonly Distributed Book<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He states (p. 35-36):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe that Abu Mikhnaf has another book (other than the one that was mentioned above), which includes chains of narrators and is continuous in format. However, there were those that removed the chains of narrators to make it a lighter tale, one without chains. It had to have been different from the language that we find in this (commonly distributed) book. Then, the hands of tampering and copyist errors for a hold of it and gave us what we find today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a serious attempt, I have gathered the narrations of Abi Mikhnaf that can be found in the early historical works and reorganized them, to be as closer to Abu Mikhnaf\u2019s original work than what we find today. I have included titles under brackets like these [ ].<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have also relied on Tareekh Al-Tabari as my main foundation and added onto it what I found in other works to fill in the gaps, or a narration that has come with some variance, or an addition, which were attributed to him (Abu Mikhnaf).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>In order to provide readers with additional proof that the commonly distributed book does not belong to Abu Mikhnaf, we have provided the expert opinions of Abbas Al-Qummi and Al-Nuri Al-Tabrasi below.<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abbas Al-Qummi View of the History of Karbala through Abu Mikhnaf<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in his book on the history of Karbala \u201cNafs Al-Mahmoom\u201d p.11 while listing his sources for his book:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/?attachment_id=3463\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3463 external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3463 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scanz0001-1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"history of karbala\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scanz0001-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scanz0001-1-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scanz0001-1-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scanz0001-1-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>And (I quoted) from the Maqtal of Al-Kalbi through Tathkirat Al-Sibt and Tareekh Al-Tabari. <strong>And (I quoted) from Maqtal Abi Mikhnaf from Al-Tabari. <\/strong>I would also refer to Al-Sayyid Ibn Tawus (may Allah have mercy on him) by Al-Sayyid.

I did this so that mind would not assume that it is what has been published within the tenth volume of Bihar Al-Anwar. It has become clear to me that this is not the book of the known Abi Mikhnaf. Abu Mikhnaf is Lut bin Yahya bin Sa\u2019eed bin Mikhnaf Al-Azdi Al-Ghamdi. He was a shaikh and a leader from amongt those of historical knowledge in Kufa. His narrations are relied upon and he narrates from Ja\u2019afar bin Mohamamd Al-Sadiq \u2013 salutations be upon him &#8211; . His father was a companion of the Commander of the Believers, Al-Hasan, and Al-Hussain \u2013 peace be onto them &#8211; . Abu Mikhnaf has a lot of books, one of which is Maqtal Al-Hussain, which is quoted and relied upon by the great scholars of old. Those that review Tareekh Al-Tabari will realize that what he quotes from Maqtal Al-Hussain \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was mostly taken from Maqtal Abi Mikhnaf. <strong>Then, if we compare this attributed copy to him and the one that was quoted by Al-Tabari and other historians, we would realize that it is not by him (Abu Mikhnaf), nor is it by any of the relied upon historians.
