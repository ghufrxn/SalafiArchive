When we take a closer look at the position of the Shia concerning the congregational prayer alongside the rest of the Muslims, we find that the early and late Shia scholars present some pretty descent material, discussing the brotherhood between Muslims and bridging the gaps and uniting the nation, they say that their Imams ordered them to pray together in congregation with the rest of the Muslims in the &#8220;Sunni&#8221; mosques, they will say that the Shia who prays next to the Sunni in a Sunni mosque will be rewarded.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia scholars have adopted this attitude\u00a0\u00a0and they openly declare it permissible for their followers to pray in congregation with the Muslims and this is indeed a positive step that they think will lessen or reduce the amount of attacks and accusations they usually receive such as them being labeled Takfeeris that make Takfeer on all non-Twelvers, or the accusation of them being hypocrites who only display a peaceful image on the outside but on the inside they hide ill-will and hatred towards all those who differ with them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to know the truth of the matter I have resolved to conduct this study, based on what the Shia scholars say in their books and on the narrations they transmitted from their Imams. The result of this study will show whether this beautiful image the Shia displayed to the rest of the Muslims is true and they should be praised for it, or a fake negative image they use only to hide their hatred for the Muslims.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Introduction:<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nBefore we begin to uncover the truth of their call we need to clarify certain terms often used by Shia scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The first term:<\/strong> &#8220;al-Mukhalif&#8221;

or in plural &#8220;Mukhalifeen&#8221; is basically all those Muslims who oppose or differ with the Twelver Shia, this terms is used by the Shia scholars to refer to Ahlul-Sunnah in all their schools and Madhabs, and then to other Shia such as the Zaidis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grand Ayatullah Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed al-Hakeem who currently resides in Najaf said in &#8220;Usool al-Fiqh&#8221;
