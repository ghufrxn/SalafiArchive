The article was written as a refutation to Ibn Al-Hashimi\u2019s article on the same subject. ShiaPen\u2019s article can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shiapen.com\/comprehensive\/hadith-manzila.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hadith that was eventually dubbed as \u201cHadith Al-Manzila\u201d is significant to every Shi\u2019ee since the beginning of tashayyu\u2019. This narration, to them, stands as clear evidence that Ali was made successor by the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). Even though the text has been interpreted by Sunni scholars to mean otherwise, the task has fallen upon us once again to reiterate this opinion while dealing with the supporting evidence brought by the ShiaPen team.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Section 1: The Meaning of Hadith Al-Manzila<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nShiaPen have done a good job of listing the relationship of Harun to Musa. They have successfully pointed out what was established in the Qur\u2019an that he was a brother, a vizier, and his caliph to his people.<br \/>\nTruly, we find that these qualities can also be found in the relationship between Ali and the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), even though Ali is not literally the brother of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam).<br \/>\nHowever, none of these qualities are specific to Ali alone.<br \/>\nFirstly, we know that the believers were all given the status of brotherhood with one another. Allah (subhanabu wa ta\u2019ala) says in His holy book:<br \/>\n\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0650\u062e\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u064c<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{The believers are but brothers}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) had many viziers that he relied on and looked to for advice, in all matters, in times of war and peace. This was not specific to Ali in any way shape or form. ShiaPen included weak disconnected narrations from Al-Dur Al-Manthoor and Al-Riyadh Al-Nadhira to establish that Ali was a vizier, even though there is no reason for them to provide evidence for a matter that is so widely accepted amongst all Muslims.<br \/>\nWe also know that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) had many caliphs. These include Ibn Um Maktoom, Abu Lubaba, Abu Ruhm, Mohammad bin Maslama, Numaila bin Abdullah Al-Laythi, Uwaif bin Al-Adhbat, Siba\u2019a bin Urfuta, and Ghalib bin Abdullah Al-Laythi. (Tareekh Khalifa, p. 48)<br \/>\nIn this light, there is no doubt that these men were also in the same status. They were also in the position of Harun to Musa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most importantly though, there was another connection between Musa and Harun, which was that Harun attained the status of prophethood through the request made by Musa.<br \/>\nIn order to dispel any confusion though, the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) pointed out to Ali that he is the final prophet, and that there will not be any prophets after him.<br \/>\nHowever, one may ask: Why would the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) liken his relationship with Ali to Musa\u2019s and Harun? The answer can be found in the context of the events.<br \/>\nIbn Al-Hashimi originally quoted Al-Thahabi:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">The Messenger of Allah set out for Tabuk with an army of 30,000 men from al-Medinah\u2026and he put Muhammad bin Maslamah Ansari in charge of al-Medinah\u2026The Prophet had left behind Ali to look after his family. The Munafiqoon used this as an opportunity to spread false rumors about Ali. They implied that the Prophet gave little importance to Ali and therefore left him alone in al-Medinah. When his patience ran out, he (Ali) hurried from al-Medinah and\u2013joining the Prophet at al-Jurf\u2013asked: \u201cThe Munafiqoon are saying such-and-such about me and so I have come to you.\u201d The Prophet of Allah said: \u201cThey are liars. I have left you behind to look after my household, so go back.\u201d In order to soothe his feelings, the Prophet further added: \u201cYou are to me as Haroon was to Musa, except that there will be no Prophet after me.\u201d Ali returned to al-Medinah pacified and satisfied.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">(Tareekh al-Islam, Vol.1, p.232)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The context makes things significantly clearer. We use the possible likenesses introduced to us by ShiaPen to fill in the blanks and then decide which makes the most sense.<br \/>\nIs it that Ali complained about being left behind and that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) reassured him that he is a brother?<br \/>\nOr is it that Ali complained about being left behind and that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) reassured him that he is a vizier?<br \/>\nBoth comparisons do not make much sense considering the context of the events. This naturally leaves the final and correct interpretation that he was reassuring him that he was a caliph upon the people of Madinah, and that this was a rank to be sought after, and that it was a status shared by Harun when he was a caliph upon his people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Section 2: The Temporal Relationship between Harun and Musa<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn the previous section, we have pointed out that we accept that Harun was Musa\u2019s brother, vizier, and caliph upon his people. We have also agreed with ShiaPen that this was the station of Ali to Mohammad as well. However, we hold the opinion that two of these stations are temporal only.<br \/>\nFirstly, there are no doubts that Ali, and all the believers are the brothers of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), both in this life and the next.<br \/>\nHowever, it is not linguistically acceptable for one to argue that Ali was the Prophet\u2019s (salalahu alaihi wa salam) vizier after his death, for the dead do not have viziers. No person in their right mind holds the belief that Ali would go to the grave of the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) and suggest war tactics and advise him\u00a0on how to run the country.<br \/>\nSimilarly, his position as a caliph upon the people of Madinah was as temporary as that of those that we have mentioned previously, like Ibn Um Maktoom, Abu Ruhm, and the others. For upon the return of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), they have rescinded their positions since he would take charge. In fact, these terms were as temporary as the caliphate of Harun upon his people, which only lasted until the return of Musa.<br \/>\nIn this context, it becomes even clearer that there is nothing to suggest that the status of Ali as\u00a0caliph extends to anything past the return of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), let alone after his death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again, we quote through Ibn Al-Hashimi who quoted Al-Qurtubi for reaffirmation that:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">There is no disagreement that Haroon died before Musa\u2026and (Haroon) was not a successor after him (Musa), for the successor (to Musa) was Yusha bin Noon (i.e. Joshua), so if he (the Prophet) wanted by his saying (to grant Ali) the Caliphate, he would have said \u201cyou will be to me like Yusha was to Musa\u201d&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Section 3: Would Ali have been the Caliph if the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) Died when in Tabuk?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ShiaPen argue:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">It is common sense from Musa (as)\u2019s words that Harun\u2019s role was that as leader and successor, and should be acknowledged as such even if he were to die before Musa (as). Therefore the fact that he died and did not become khalifa does not in anyway alter this fact. Whilst we acknowledge that Yusha bin Nun became khalifa after Musa (as), this was only because Harun (as) passed away during his brother\u2019s lifetime, had this not been the case Harun would have been khalifa. Once it is proven that Harun (as) had been appointed as the Khalifa of Musa (as) during his lifetime, then the same applies to Imam Ali (as), in Hadith Manzila the Prophet (s) made it clear that just like the appointment of Harun (as) by Musa (as), he (s) was likewise appointing Ali (as) as the Khalifa in his absence.<\/span><br \/>\nThe assumptions made by ShiaPen are ridiculous at best, since we have already established that were many companions that have held these positions.<br \/>\nIf the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) died when he was out during Hijjat Al-Wada\u2019a, then Ibn Um Maktoob would have been appointed as the permanent caliph according to the suggestion brought by ShiaPen. (Tareekh Khalifa, p. 48)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Section 4: Did the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) say \u201cHadith Al-Manzila\u201d on Other Occasions (in Sunni Hadiths)?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In response to the issue of context, ShiaPen refer to the Sunni view as \u201cutter bigotry\u201d. They suggest that context should not be a factor since the narration has occurred in instances other than Tabuk. They also suggest that the statement \u201cthere is no Prophet after me\u201d makes the context nonsensical. This has been addressed previously both in this article and Ibn Al-Hashimi\u2019s article, so we shall move on to the narrations.<br \/>\nIt should be noted that all the narrations that ShiaPen quote are weak, what is authentic and \u00a0established is that it happened on the way to Tabuk.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First narration:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">We read in Zakhair al-Uqba, page 120:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cAsma bint Umays said: \u2018When Fatima gave birth to Hassan, the Prophet (pbuh) said to me: \u2018O Asma, bring my grandson to me\u2019. Then I wrapped him in a yellow cloth and gave him to the Prophet. The Prophet put him on his shoulder and said: \u2018I never saw you wrapping a child with a yellow cloth\u2019. Then he (the Prophet) replaced the cloth with a white one and then recited Adhan in (Haasan\u2019s) right ear, and thene recited Iqama in (Haasan\u2019s) left ear. The Prophet (s) then asked: \u2018Ali, What have you named the child?\u2019 He replied: \u2018How can I keep it before you?\u2019. The Prophet (s) then said: \u2018I can also not give a name until Allah (swt) decides\u2019. Gibrael then descended saying: \u2018O Muhammad your Creator conveys Peace on you and says Ali is to you as Harun was to Musa except there is no prophet after you, give the child the same name that Harun gave his child\u2026\u2019<\/span><br \/>\nUpon returning to the text, we found that this narration was taken from the Saheefa of Ali Al-Redha, which is a Shi\u2019ee text. Indeed, the narration was found on page seventy three of the text. The book has come to us through Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Aamer Al-Ta\u2019ee from his father from Ali Al-Redha. However, this book is a fabrication attributed to Al-Redha. See Mizan Al-I\u2019itidal 4\/59.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second narration:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">We read in Tarikh Damishq, Volume 42 page 167:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cIbn Abbas narrated that he heard Umar bin al-Khattab discussing with some people about the first Muslims, thus Umar said: \u2018I heard Allah\u2019s messenger (pbuh) saying three virtues about Ali, if I had one of these (virtues) it would be more lovable to me than anything else.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">I was with Abu Ubayda, Abu Bakr and a group of companions, then the Prophet (s) patted Ali\u2019s shoulder and said: \u2018O Ali, you are the strongest amongst the believers in faith, the first Muslim who embraced Islam and your status to me is like the status of Harun to Musa\u201d. <\/span><br \/>\nThis narration comes through the path of Abdullah bin Athran, who doesn\u2019t have a biography in hadith books. It also comes through the path of Al-Ma\u2019moun, from Al-Rasheed, from Al-Mahdi, from Al-Mansour, the Abbasid caliphs, who were not hadith narrators. The narration is an obvious fabrication.<br \/>\nShiaPen provide a supplementary version of the same narration from Kanz Al-Umal, but it contains no chain, and is therefore weak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third narration:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">We read in Tarikh Dasmishq, Volume 42 page 170:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cJaffar bin Abi Talib said: \u2018When Hamza\u2019s daughter arrived at Madina, Ali, Jafar and Zaid disputed about her, thus Allah\u2019s messenger (a) said: \u2018Tell me what is wrong?\u2019 Zaid said: \u2018She is my niece and I\u2019m worthier to take of her\u2019. Ali said: \u2018She is my cousin and I have brought her here\u2019. Jafar said: \u2018She is my cousin, and her aunt is my wife\u2019. (The prophet) said: \u2018O Jaffar, take her, you are worthier (to take care of her)\u2019. Then Allah\u2019s messenger said: \u2018I will judge between you, as for you Zaid, you are my friend, and I\u2019m your friend. As for you Jafar, you look like me physically and ethically. As for you Ali, your status to me is like the status of Aaron to Moses, except the prophethood\u2019..\u201d\u2019. <\/span><br \/>\nThe narration comes through the path of Abdulrahman bin Abi Bakr bin Ubaidullah who is weak to Yahya, Abu Hatim, Al-Nasa\u2019ee, Ahmad, Al-Bazzar, and others. See his biography in Al-Tahtheeb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fourth narration:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">We read in Fadhail al-Sahaba, Volume 2 page 638 Tradition 1085:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u201cZayd bin Abi Awfa said: \u2018I went to Allah\u2019s messenger in his mosque, then he (Zaid) mentioned the story of brotherhood amongst the companions of Allah\u2019s messenger. Then Ali said to the Prophet (s): \u2018I lost my patience and felt sorrow when I saw you doing that to your companions but not to me, if I have incurred your displeasure I wish to apologise\u2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">Allah\u2019s messenger said: \u2018I swear by He who sent me with the truth, I only left you for myself, your status to me is like the status of Harun to Musa except there is no Prophet after me, you are my brother and my inheritor\u2019. (Ali) said: \u2018O Allah\u2019s messenger, what shall I inherit from you?\u2019 (The Prophet) said: \u2018You shall inherit from me what the prophets used to inherit\u2019. (Ali) said: \u2018What did the Prophets inherit?\u2019 (The Prophet) said: \u2018The book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet, you are with me in my palace in paradise along with my daughter Fatima, you are my brother and my friend\u2019. Then Allah\u2019s messenger recited the verse { (they shall be) as brethren, on raised couches, face to face.} 015.047\u201d <\/span><br \/>\nThe narration comes through the path of Abdulmu\u2019min bin Abbad who has been weakened by Abu Hatim and Al-Bukhari.

The Prophet (s) then went after him and when he found him, he (s) patted him by his feet and said: \u2018Stand up, you should be called Abu Turab, are you angry because I made brotherhood between the Muhajreen and Ansar whilst I left you without making brotherhood? Aren\u2019t you pleased that your status to me is like the status of Harun to Musa except there is no prophet after me? Whoever loved you is faithful and who ever hated you, God will make him die a pre-Islamic death and will be judged about his deeds in Islam\u2019. <\/span><br \/>\nThe narration comes to us through Hamid bin Adam, who was declared as a liar by Al-Jawzajani, Ibn Adi, and Al-Sulaimani.

Thus we woke up and Ali woke up, then Allah\u2019s messenger (s) said: \u2018O Ali, come here, it you are permitted to remain in the mosque whatever is allowed for me, don\u2019t you like the fact that your status to me is like the status of Harun to Musa except there is no Prophet after me\u2019..\u201d. <\/span><br \/>\nThe narration comes to us through Haram bin Uthman.

Then Ali cried, thus he (prophet) said to him: \u2018Arent you pleased that your status to me is similar to that of Harun to Musa except there shall be no prophet after me, I shall not leave without you being my caliph\u2019. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">Al Hakim decalred it \u2018Sahih\u2019 while Dhahabi found no objection to it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">We should point out that this hadith in no way contradicts the other narrations found in the likes of Bukhari, it merely narrates further details that the other narrations did not have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the same narration of Abu Balj which we have weakened in another article found <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2013\/05\/02\/response-to-alee-a-s-the-master-of-every-believer\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>.

We read in Ma\u2019ani al-Akhbar by Seduq, page 74:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">Abu Harun al-Abdi said: \u2018I asked Jabir bin Abdullah al-Ansari about the meaning of Allah\u2019s messenger (s)\u2019 statement to Ali (as): \u2018Your status to me is like the status of Harun to Musa except there is no Prophet after me\u2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">He (Jabir) said: \u2018By Allah he (the Prophet) made him (Ali) Caliph during his (s) life and after his death and made obedience of him (Ali) obligatory, so whoever didn\u2019t submit to his Caliphate after hearing this statement, is verily amongst the unjust\u2019\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The narration comes through the path of Isma\u2019eel bin Abaan, who is anonymous according to Al-Jawahiri (p. 62). The narration includes other anonymous narrators as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, after going through all the narrations we have come to the realization that Hadith Al-Manzila cannot be found as part of the story of the conquest of Tabuk within any Shi\u2019ee book through an authentic chain, and that the only authentic narration about this event can be found in Al-Saduq\u2019s Amali in Bani Al-Mustaliq. Though, we do have issues with this narration, since it is a major exaggeration of the events that took place at Bani Al-Mustaliq, since it includes that Khalid bin Al-Waleed asked the people to pray and then killed them. This action is not one that a fasiq commits, let alone a Muslim. It is therefore, inconceivable that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) would leave him in charge of his armies after such a vicious act. Moreover, the narration, in its original form, can be found in Sirat Ibn Hisham, though Ibn Ishaaq, who narrated it through Hakeem bin Hakeem through Al-Baqir. The narration doesn\u2019t include these false additions, nor does it include the addition of \u201cYou are to me as Harun was to Musa.\u201d See Ibn Hisham 2\/365. In this light, we reject then the additions as\u00a0fabrications that were concocted in order to dramatize the events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though we have always rejected this narration since it came from a Shi\u2019ee source, we made our case in order to invite the objective Shi\u2019ee reader onto our ranks by accepting the Sunni version of Hadith Al-Manzila. The Sunni version is the one that actually fits the context after all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to ShiaPen\u2019s article entitled: The Hadith of Manzila.
