We reject that Abu Huraira had such a reputation simply because he uttered these words. <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/01\/11\/abu-huraira\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Abu Huraira<\/a> may have simply narrated this narration, then felt doubt, and then repeating the narration and suggested that he was accused of lying. Truly, if someone was accused of lying, he wouldn\u2019t simply say, \u201cI testify,\u201d and assume that such a thing is enough. This is why we maintain that he did not have such a reputation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, if the people of Iraq did indeed hold such a view, then this is problematic for the people of Iraq, not for Abu Huraira, due to what has been already established by the main companions of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) that he is trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also important to realize that this is not referring to all the people of Iraq, but a group of unknown Iraqis. So it is simply ridiculous to take the opinion of such people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, even the prophets of Allah have been accused of lying, and that did nothing to hurt their credibility in the eyes of Allah (subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in His Holy book that they called Nuh (alaih al-salam) a liar:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0623\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0633\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0638\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0630\u0650\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, &#8220;Indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you are of the liars.&#8221;}<br \/>\n(Al-A\u2019araf: 66)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shu\u2019aib (alaih al-salam) was also accused of lying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0631\u064c \u0645\u0650\u062b\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0646\u064e\u0638\u064f\u0646\u0651\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0630\u0650\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{You are but a man like ourselves, and indeed, we think you are among the liars.}<br \/>\n(Al-Shu\u2019ara\u2019a: 186)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the people of Quraish held accused Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) of lying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062c\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0630\u0650\u0631\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0633\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\u064c \u0643\u064e\u0630\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves.
