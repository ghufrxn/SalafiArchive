Just as the Jews in Arabia awaited a promised prophet at the end of times to grant them victory so did the Christians as they await the second advent of `Isa (as) who will rule a kingdom with no end. The Muslims are no different in this regard; our Prophet (saw) had promised us that we shall be under the authority of a fair and just ruler; he is the guided one, the Mahdi who will be born at the end of times. The savior of the Muslims shall rule for seven years according to reliable mainstream narrations then the authority will be transferred to prophet `Isa (as) who will rule forty years and defeat the enemies of Islam and their Dajjal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many legitimate books discussed the Mahdi and what our Prophet (saw) said about him based on the reliable and authentic reports, from them we list \u201cAl-Ahadith al-Waridah fil-Mahdi fi Mizan al-Jarh wal-Ta`dil\u201d by `Abdul-`Alim `Abdul-`Azim &amp; \u201cAl-Mahdi wa Fiqh Ashrat-ul-Sa`ah\u201d by Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Isma`il al-Muqaddim and plenty of others\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our research in this piece shall not be regarding the true Mahdi that the majority of Muslims believe in nor is it related to the beliefs of the average Muslim you may encounter, rather we will be discussing historical personalities who were falsely claimed to be the \u201cMahdi\u201d by a small group of deviants calling themselves \u201cThe Shia\u201d. For this purpose we shall go through the books of the Shia sects as well as the books of the expert scholars and renowned historians who interacted with such sects and often debated their leaders and collected their books, all while documenting the early beliefs held by these groups, especially those of the various Shia sects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: Many people throughout history claimed to be the Mahdi, even in our days one may find a few especially in Iran, Yemen and `Iraq.

Husayn and in order to give our readers a description of how confused the Shia were concerning this alleged 12<sup>th<\/sup> Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We quote J. M. Husayn below:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sa\u2019d al-Qummi counted fifteen schisms, whereas al-Nawbakhti and al-Mufid enumerated them as fourteen. Al-Mas`udi thinks that there were twenty sects (in al-Murouj), while al-Shahristani counts only eleven. Nevertheless a study of the claims of these factions reveals that there were apparently only five major schisms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, each of these became further split over the theological and traditional arguments employed to support their claims. At any rate it seems important to set down the major claims of these schisms in order to achieve a clear conception of the Imamiyyah at that time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Schism I: the Waqifah at al-`Askari<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What brought the people of this faction together was their claim that the eleventh Imam, al-`Askari, was al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi although they differed as to how he became al-Qa\u2019im.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">i) The first faction of this schism deemed that al- `Askari had not died, but had gone into occultation. They based their assumption on the traditions reported from the previous Imams, which said that an Imam could not die without having a publicly acknowledged son to succeed him, because the world cannot be without a Proof.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the people were not obliged to accept the Imamate of those who were now laying claim to it, they should acknowledge the Imamate of al\u00ad`Askari whose Imamate had been confirmed by the testament of the former Imam. They also maintained that they had a tradition which said that al-Qa\u2019im had two occultations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, since al-`Askari had not left a publicly acknowledged son and since the earth cannot remain for an hour without a Proof, it was right to claim that he had not died but was hidden, and that he was truly al-Qa\u2019im.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was his first occultation, after which he would rise again. Then, when his rising became known, he would conceal himself once more in his second occultation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In their discussions with their opponents, they tried to distinguish themselves from the Imamiyyah who had stopped at the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim (183\/799), claiming he was al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi, by faulting them for stopping at al-Kadhim. They pointed out that he had died and left his successor, `Ali al-Rida (202\/817) as well as other sons, while al-`Askari had obviously passed away and left no heir.<\/p>\n<p>ii) The second faction of the Waqifah at al-`Askari believed that he had died, but was then raised to life, and was al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi Basically, the members of this faction established their doctrine on a transmission from Imam Ja`far al-Sadiq, who said that al-Qa\u2019im was called al-Qa\u2019im because he would &#8220;rise&#8221; again after his death. They stated that it was certain that al-`Askari had died without leaving a successor and without designating anyone as his legatee.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus there was no doubt about his being al-Qa\u2019im, nor about his being alive after death, although he concealed himself for fear of his foes. They supported their theories with a saying of Imam `Ali bin Abi Talib, contained in his advice to his follower <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/01\/22\/dua-kumayl-not-authentic\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Kumayl <\/a>bin Ziyad, &#8220;O Allah, indeed You do not leave the earth without a Qa\u2019im with proof from You, whether manifest or hidden, for then Your proofs and Your signs would be invalidated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the basis of `Ali&#8217;s words they concluded that al-`Askari was absent and hidden, but that he would rise to fill the earth with peace and justice after it had been filled with tyranny.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iii) Al-Waqifah al-la Adriyyah also stopped at al-`Askari. They deemed that he had died and had been the Imam. Although the earth could not be without a Proof from Allah, they were not sure who had succeeded al-`Askari, his son or his brother. Therefore they stopped at the Imamate of al-`Askari, and decided to make no decision until the matter became clear to them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, the contemporary sources do not mention anyone as representing the three factions of al-Waqifah at al-`Askari. However, from the doctrine of the first faction of the Waqifah, it seems that its partisans lived in places which were far from Samarra\u2019, the city of the Imam. Since they were not present at the moment of his death, they tended to believe that he had not in fact died, but was al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Schism II: The Ja`farites<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The representatives of this schism claimed that the Imam after al\u00ad`Askari was his youngest brother, Ja`far, but they differed as to how the Imamate had passed on to him, and therefore split into four factions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">i) The first faction believed that al- `Askari had died and that he had held the Imamate by the testament of his father. Since the Imamate can only pass to the eldest living son of the former Imam, the Imamate passed from `Ali al-Hadi not to his eldest son Muhammad, who had died before him, but to al-`Askari, who was the elder of the two sons who had outlived their father.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This faction believed that al-`Askari had not left a publicly acknowledged son to take over the Imamate and, therefore, his sole remaining brother, Ja`far, was the Imam. In order to support their dogma they were obliged to repeat the Fatahiyyah&#8217;s arguments about the Imamate. The latter claimed that Musa al-Kadhim received the Imamate, not from his father Ja`far al-Sadiq, but from his eldest brother `Abd Allah, according to the tradition which says that the Imamate passes on to the eldest son of the Imam when he dies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like the Fathiyya, this faction of the Ja`farites accepted the authenticity of the tradition which says that the Imamate will not fall to two brothers after al-Hasan and al-Husayn. But they maintained that this could only be applied if al-`Askari had left a son. Since al-`Askari had passed away without leaving a publicly acknowledged successor, his brother Ja`far was the designated Imam and the Imamate would pass on in his offspring.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also recognized `Abd Allah bin Ja`far al-Sadiq as the seventh Imam. Consequently Ja`far was thirteenth in the chain of Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ii) The second faction of the Ja`farites contended that the eleventh Imam had himself designated Ja`far as his successor according to the principle of al-Bada&#8217;. The same thing had happened in the case of Isma`il, the eldest son of Imam Ja`far al\u00adSadiq. God had clarified His ultimate decision concerning him by taking away his soul and placing his brothers `Abd Allah and Musa consecutively in the Imamate instead.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, in the case of Ja`far bin `Ali, God had entrusted al-`Askari with the Imamate, but thereafter He had made it clear that the Imamate should not pass on in the progeny of al-`Askari. Therefore He transferred it to his brother Ja`far, who was the Imam after al-`Askari&#8217;s death. Like the previous factions, this faction used the argument and dogma of the Fatahiyyah to support their viewpoint.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This sect was probably more popular than the first among the theologians, especially in Kufah. Its leader was a Kufi theologian called `Ali bin Tahl or al-Talhi al-Khazzaz, who had been famous amongst the surviving members of the Fatahiyyah for his skill in theological discussions. He upheld Ja`far&#8217;s Imamate and encouraged people to take his side. He was supported in his propaganda by the sister of Faris bin Hatim bin Mahawiyyah al-Qazwini, although she rejected the Imamate of al- `Askari and claimed that the Imamate had been transferred to Ja`far from his father, `Ali al-Hadi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She may have had this claim because her brother, Faris bin Hatim, was killed on the order of al- `Askari. It is also possible that the Kufan scholastic family Banu Faddal, who were active supporters of the Fatahiyyah, adopted the doctrine of this faction, especially Ahmad bin al-Hasan bin `Ali bin Muhammad bin Faddal, who died in 260\/874, and his brother `Ali.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iii) The members of this faction claimed that the Imamate had passed on to Ja`far through the designation of his father. They based their doctrine on a tradition attributed to Ja`far al-Sadiq, which states that the Imamate cannot be held by two brothers after al-Hasan and al-Husayn. Since Muhammad, the eldest son of `Ali al-Hadi, died during the lifetime of his father, and since the Imamate should belong to those who survive the death of their father, it had not been transferred to Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They may have accepted the Imamate of al-`Askari because he was the eldest son after the death of his father, but they rejected his Imamate after his death, because he had passed away without leaving a publicly acknowledged son as his successor. It was a matter of course to them, they said, that the Imam could not die without leaving a publicly acknowledged and well\u00ad known successor, designated by him and entrusted with the Imamate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore the claim of al-`Askari to the Imamate must be invalid. So it was inevitable that the Imam was Ja`far, by the designation of his father.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is worth mentioning that this faction existed within the lifetime of al- `Askari. When the tenth Imam died in 254\/868 the majority of his followers accepted the Imamate of his eldest surviving son, al\u00ad`Askari, as confirmed by the testament of his father, but a minority took Ja`far&#8217;s side. He became more powerful after al- `Askari&#8217;s death, since some of al- `Askari&#8217;s adherents abandoned his Imamate and accepted that of Ja`far. A leading scholar of this faction was `Ali bin Ahmad bin Bashshar, who wrote a book on the Ghaybah and disputed fiercely with his opponents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is some evidence that this faction achieved a certain degree of success by persuading a few of the people who had accepted al- `Askari&#8217;s Imamate to join their side. Al-Saduq and al-Majlisi report a letter attributed to the Twelfth Imam, and sent to his agent, `Uthman bin Sa`id al-`Umari. This letter reveals that an adherent of this faction argued with a Twelver called al-Mukhtar, and succeeded in making him accept the Imamate of Ja`far. The sister of Faris bin Hatim, who was mentioned above, was one of the partisans of this group.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iv) The followers of this faction were called al-Nafisiyyah. They believed that the tenth Imam had designated his eldest son Muhammad as his legatee. Then, according to the principle of Bada&#8217;, Allah took away his life while his father was still alive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But when Muhammad bin `Ali passed away, by the order of his father, he designated his brother Ja`far as his successor. He entrusted his testament, the books, the secret knowledge and the weapons needed by the community to his trustworthy young slave called Nafis. And he ordered him to hand them over to his brother Ja`far when his father died.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, when Muhammad died, the adherents of al-`Askari discovered the secret arrangement and the role of Nafis. Since Nafis was afraid of them and feared that the Imamate might be cut short, he called Ja`far and handed over the trust of Muhammad bin `Ali al\u00ad Hadi. Ja`far himself claimed that the Imamate had been passed to him from his brother, Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The members of this faction denied the testament of al-Hasan al-`Askari, because his father, they claimed, had neither designated him nor changed his testament from Muhammad. Nafis was killed by being drowned in a well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Schism III: The Muhammadiyyah<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This sect denied the Imamate of Ja`far and al-`Askari and considered Muhammad, who had died in the lifetime of his father, as their Imam. They argued that `Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, had neither designated nor indicated either al-`Askari or Ja`far as his legatee. Therefore neither of them had any right to make claims upon the Imamate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the Imam could not die without leaving a successor, and since al-`Askari had passed away and not left a publicly acknowledged or well-known son, his Imamate was invalidated. Ja`far, they added, was not worthy of putting forward a claim because his immorality and sinfulness were infamous. His wicked character could not be prudent fear (Taqiyyah) in the face of his enemies, for Taqiyyah cannot be practiced by committing sins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They concluded that since it was forbidden for the Imamate to be nullified, they were obliged to return to the Imamate of Muhammad bin `Ali, since he had left offspring and his acts were distinguished by probity and virtue. Others of them even considered him as al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi and some of them went as far as to deny his death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Schism IV: The Qat`iyyah<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This faction constituted the greater portion of the Imamiyyah. They believed that al-`Askari had died and left a son to succeed him, but they differed about the day of his birth, his name, and whether or not he was al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi. For this reason they split into six groups:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">i) The first group maintained that al- `Askari had died and left a son called Muhammad. According to Sa`d al-Qummi, they held that his son had come of age, while, according to al-Nawbakhti and al-Shahristani, they believed that he had been born two years before his father&#8217;s death. He was the Imam because his father had designated him so, and because it was well-known that al- `Askari had left no other son. So inevitably he was the Imam and al-Qa\u2019im.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But due to fear of his uncle, Ja`far, he went into concealment and this became one of his occultations. This group built their doctrine on a tradition attributed to Ja`far al-Sadiq, which says that al-Qa\u2019im&#8217;s date of birth is hidden from the people, information concerning him is obscure, and the people cannot know him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately little is known about this faction, but al-Saduq, while trying to prove the birth of the Twelfth Imam, mentions traditions which are presumably attributed to this faction&#8217;s adherents. One of these was called Ya&#8217;qub bin Manfush, who claimed that he had visited al-`Askari and asked him about his successor. Al-`Askari showed him his son, who was between eight and ten years old, indicating that his son would succeed him. Another was called Daw&#8217; bin Ali al-`Ijli, who maintained that he had met al-`Askari in his house where he saw his son, who was then two years old.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ii) The members of this group held the same dogma as the previous faction. They agreed with them on the death of al- `Askari, but they thought that he had left a successor whose name was not Muhammad but &#8216;Ali. They said that al-`Askari had no son except &#8216;Ali, who had been seen by his father&#8217;s trustworthy followers. According to Sa`d al-Qummi this sect had few adherents and they were concentrated within the suburbs (the Sawad) of Kufah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iii) This sect held that the Imam after al-`Askari was his son, who had been born eight months after his father&#8217;s death and had then gone into concealment. They argued that those who claimed that a son was born to him during his lifetime were making false statements, because al- `Askari had died without leaving a publicly acknowledged son.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the pregnancy had been known to the caliph as well as other people, and for this reason the caliph delayed dividing his share in the state until the pregnancy was proved invalid. In fact, they said, the son was born eight months after the death of his father and was ridden, and his father had ordered that he be called Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They based their doctrine on a tradition attributed to the eighth main, `Ali bin Musa al-Ri\u010fa, which says, &#8220;You would test the fetus which is within the womb of his mother, and the suckling child.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iv) The partisans of this faction held that al-`Askari had no sons at all. The arguments about a hidden son, who was born during the lifetime of al- `Askari, were rejected by them, because they had searched for him during the life of the eleventh Imam using various means, but had failed to find him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But since the Imam cannot die without leaving an heir, they claimed that a slave girl had conceived a child belonging to al- `Askari, and that when she gave birth to him he would be the Imam, even if, as they are reported to have said by al-Mufid, the pregnancy should last a hundred years. They established their doctrine on a tradition of al-Sadiq, which states that al-Qa\u2019im is he whose conception and date of birth are hidden from the people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">v) This faction held that the Imam after al- `Askari was his son Muhammad, who was the Awaited One (al-Muntazar). They claimed that he had died but would rise to life with the sword to fill the earth with peace and justice after it had been filled with tyranny and injustice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This group is mentioned neither by Sa`d al-Qummi nor by al-Nawbakhti. Presumably the latter dealt with it but this discussion was later dropped from his work, since al-Mufid who based his information on al-Nawbakhti&#8217;s work, mentions this group in al\u00ad`Uyun wal-Mahasin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">vi) This group, entitled the Imamiyyah by Sa`d al-Qummi and al-Nawbakhti, held that al- `Askari had died and that inevitably Allah&#8217;s Hujjah (proof) on earth was his son. He was his sole successor and legatee, charged with the affairs of the Imamate after him in accordance with the method laid down by previous tradition. Thus the Imamate should pass on to his offspring until the Day of Resurrection, but he was absent and hidden by an order.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was prohibited to seek him out before he chose to manifest himself, because his adherents would endanger his life and their own if they looked for him. In spite of his occultation a few reliable followers could contact him. He was born on 15th Sha&#8217;ban 256\/29th July 868.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Basically this group directed their arguments against those factions which supported the Imamate of Muhammad and Ja`far. With the partisans of Muhammad they argued that the Imamate could be held neither by the descendants of Muhammad, who had died during his father&#8217;s lifetime, nor by his legatee, such as his brother or someone else, because there was no evidence or proof for accepting the Imamate of a son who had died before his father. Perhaps this argument was also directed against the Nafisiyyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Presumably with the Ja`farites they argued that the Imamate could not pass from brother to brother after al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and that the Imamate should fall to the eldest son of the preceding Imam. The eleventh Imam al- `Askari, was designated by the testament of his father, so the Imamate had to pass to his offspring. They also said that it was improper for the faithful to select an Imam for themselves. Allah had to choose him and to manifest him at the proper time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This faction constituted the majority of the Imamiyyah who had accepted the Imamate of al- `Askari, such as Abu Sahl Isma`il bin `Ali al-Nawbakhti, al-Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti, Sa`d bin `Abd Allah al-Ash`ari al-Qummi (the author of Kitab al-Maqalat wal-Firaq), `Uthman bin Sa`id al- `Umari and his son Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Schism V: The Cessation of the Imamate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This group held that from the moment al-`Askari died there was no longer an Imam. Al-Nawbakhti, al-Mufid and al-Shahristani considered this group as one faction, whereas Sa`d al-Qummi was presumably more accurate when he divided it into two, since the partisans of this schism agreed on the death of al-`Askari and the cessation of the Imamate, while they differed on the dogma of al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">i) The first group deemed that it had been confirmed by successive transmission that al-`Askari would die without leaving a successor. For this reason there was no Imam after al-`Askari and the Imamate ceased. This, they contended, was reasonable and permitted. Since the cessation of the prophecy after Muhammad was possible, the cessation of the Imamate was also possible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They established their doctrine on a transmission attributed to the sixth Imam, Ja`far al-Sadiq, which states that the earth cannot be without a Proof unless Allah becomes angry at the sins of His creatures and retains him from them for as long as He wills. This group did not believe in the rising of al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ii) The people of the second group held the same doctrine as the previous faction, but they separated from them over the dogma of al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi They said that since al-`Askari had passed away without leaving a successor, the Imamate had ceased until Allah raised the Qa&#8217;im from among the Imams who had died, such as al-Hasan al- `Askari, or from among any of his descendants.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore the rising of al-Qa\u2019im al-Mahdi was inevitable because this was confirmed by successive tradition. They considered the period after the death of al- `Askari and the rise of al-Qa\u2019im as an interval of time devoid of prophecy and Imamate, like the period between Jesus and Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is some evidence that many people from various countries doubted the existence of the Twelfth Imam, such as Muhammad bin Ali bin Mahzayar al-Ahwazi from al-Ahwaz, and many of the persons from Banu Talib in Medina who had been agents of the eleventh Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This historical and theological survey suggests that on the death of al- `Askari, the Imamiyyah fell into problems similar to those which had beset them after the death of the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim. They split into al-Waqifah, Muhammadiyyah, Ja`fariyyah and Qat`iyyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(\u2026etc\u2026)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, as al-Mufid and al-Tusi state, all these divisions and splits gradually vanished, except for the Qat`iyyah, who became the Twelvers in the fourth\/tenth century.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-End of quote-<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>-What really happened after the death of the 11<sup>th<\/sup> Imam?-<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to find out what really happened from a historical perspective, aside from the fairy tales and mythical stories invented by the various competing Shia sects, we must turn to the books written by reliable scholars and expert historians.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We quote the leader of the Mu`tazillah al-Qadi `Abdul-Jabbar who quotes from the head of Mu`tazillah aba al-Qasim al-Balkhi [d.329AH]<\/p>\n<p>[He said: And al-Hasan bin `Ali (al-`Askari) died in my\u00a0time and left behind no children, so they (i.e his followers) became confused.] (Kitab-ul-Imamah min Al-Mughni)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We quote Imam `Ali bin Ahmad ibn Hazm al-Dhahiri [d.456AH]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Then al-Hasan (al-`Askari) died without leaving behind any descendants, so they (The Shia) split into groups and most believed that al-Hasan had a son whom he had concealed, it was also said that he was born after al-Hasan\u2019s death from a female servant of his called Saqil and this is the most popular story, others said from a servant called Narjis and others said from a servant called Sawsan but what is most apparent in their view is that she was Saqil. This woman called Saqil had claimed pregnancy after the death of her master al-Hasan bin `Ali and this was why his inheritance was frozen for seven years. Ja`far bin `Ali who was al-Hasan\u2019s brother had disputes with her regarding this inheritance so a group of men from the government sided with her staunchly while others sided with Ja`far. Finally, it was revealed that there was no pregnancy and Ja`far acquired his brother\u2019s inheritance; al-Hasan had died in the year two hundred and sixty. Meanwhile, the fanaticism of the Rafidah towards this Saqil and her claims increased so much that (the Caliph) al-Mu`tadid had to imprison her after around twenty years from her masters\u2019 death; she was then found in the house of al-Hasan bin Ja`far al-Nawbakhti the writer so they carried her to the castle of al-Mu`tadid where she remained until she died in (Caliph) al-Muqtadir\u2019s time. They (the Shia) have been waiting for this person since more than a hundred and eighty years.] (Al-Fasl fil-Milal Ibn Hazm)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, as the reader can already tell from all the above, it\u2019s very clear that the 11<sup>th<\/sup> Imam had no children, this in turn led his followers to differ among themselves and divide to many sects which in itself shows that the man had no successor for if he did, then there is no sound explanation for all the chaos above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of al-`Askari\u2019s followers denied his Imamah after they saw that he left no heir while others jumped from him to his brothers Ja`far and Muhammad since they had no choice. The majority were in a very tough spot as they already narrated many reports claiming the man was a legitimate Imam so they couldn\u2019t go back on their words or their necks and livelihoods were on the line, so they decided to tell people that he did in fact have a son and they spread this and they differed on almost every aspect of this son\u2019s existence because they didn\u2019t plan their lies carefully, they would use excuses that his father showed him to only a select few individuals and then hid him from the public eye out of fear for him or that his mother didn\u2019t appear pregnant since Imams are born from the thighs of their mothers not their wombs or that the Imam can grow in one day like an average human grows in one week and that\u2019s how he was able to escape and go into hiding or that he had now disappeared completely but still sends them letters from an unknown location and only one man can communicate with him as an emissary or that his existence must remain a secret and so nobody must utter his name in public or even in written form and the narrations are famous so refer back to the books of the folks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above-mentioned group of lunatics is what exists today as \u201cTwelver Shia\u201d, but the reality of the matter is that the man passed without a known heir and what the previous team said was nothing but a claim. The followers of al-`Askari wished to retrieve the fortunes that their deceased Imam received in his life from the na\u00efve Shia, they feared that since he passed away then his inheritance would go to their enemy Ja`far bin `Ali al-`Askari whom they had branded as an immoral liar. Allah knows best whether Ja`far was in reality as they claimed or if he was an upright pious man who suffered a campaign of defamation by rival Shia gangs who opposed his Imamah for it is a known habit of the Shia to try and raise the status of their Imams by insulting others. It also seems that some of the heads of the Shia thought that the best way to prevent this was to claim that al-Hasan had a son who happened to be in his mother\u2019s womb and that one of his father\u2019s female servants was pregnant with him. Knowing how wealthy al-`Askari was he must have had quite a few female servants and so these Shia differed on which one was the mother, some said Narjis, some said Rayhanah and others said Sawsan as well as many others. One of these women called Saqil, -apparently a Nubian slave girl from Africa- she became greedy for her master\u2019s wealth and so she stepped up and openly claimed to be the divine savior\u2019s mother and she was backed by some of the most prominent Shia clerics and figure-heads. However, Ja`far wasn\u2019t going to remain silent and watch his rightful inheritance be stolen by a band of thugs, so he disputed with them and fought them for it until the matter reached the ears of the Sultan. The Sultan then sent expert women to verify whether Saqil was truly pregnant and they exposed her for the liar that she was and Ja`far acquired his right. The Shia are popular for being a stubborn bunch and they never admit their misguidance so even after all of this they kept sanctifying Saqil for twenty years and claiming that she was the hidden Imam\u2019s mother and they became so great in number that the Sultan became cautious so he called for her and they found her hidden in the house of one of the men of Nawbakht, then she was arrested in the palace until her death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next we quote Imam abu al-`Abbas ibn Tayymiyyah al-Harrani [d.728AH]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We say: It was stated by Imam abu al-Husayn `Abdul-Baqi bin Qani` [d.351AH] and Imam abu Ja`far Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari [d.310AH] as well as others from the scholars of history and genealogy that al-Hasan bin `Ali al-`Askari had no descendants or children. As for the Imamiyyah who claim that he had a son who entered the cellar while still a child, some of them said: \u201cHe was two years old\u201d others said: \u201cHe was three\u201d and some said: \u201cHe was five\u201d, I say: If this character was in fact present and known, then according to Allah\u2019s laws which were established in the Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah and the consensus, he should be placed under the guardianship of whoever can take care of him such as his mother or his grandmother, and his wealth must be placed under the responsibility of the executor of his father\u2019s will, a near relative or a representative of the Sultan, this is because he is an orphan that lost his father and Allah says: {Test well the orphans, until they reach the age of marrying; then, if you perceive in them right judgment, deliver to them their property; consume it not wastefully and hastily ere they are grown. If any man is rich, let him be abstinent; if poor, let him consume in reason. And when you deliver to them their property, take witnesses over them; God suffices for a reckoner.} [4:6] One cannot hand to this child his money until he reaches the age of marriage and maturity as Allah declared, so how then can a person who can\u2019t be responsible for his own body and property be the leader of all Muslims, immune to error and that the one who denies him is a disbeliever!? Then by their own consensus whether he happened to exist or not, then they do not benefit anything from him in their world or religion, nor did he teach anyone anything and we do not know of a good deed that he accomplished or a bad one, nor did we achieve through him any of the benefits of leadership, or its goals in general. On the contrary, if this character happens to actually exist then his existence is only a cause of harm for the people of the earth, this is because those who insist on believing in him have not benefitted from his grace nor did they fulfill their interests with his aid, while those who deny him will be punished and tortured on the day of judgment according to them. Therefore, he is pure evil, there is no goodness in him whatsoever and this kind of creature cannot be the work of the all-wise God of justice.

His birth was on Friday, the middle of Sha`ban in 255 hijri, when his father died he was five years of age, his mother\u2019s name is Khamt, it was also said Narjis. The Shia say: He entered the cellar in his father\u2019s house while his mother looked at him and never returned to her, this was in 265 hijri while he was nine. Ibn al-Azraq had mentioned in his history book that this Hujjah whom we speak of was born on the ninth of Rabi`-ul-Awwal in the year 258 hijri, and it was said: the eight of Sha`ban in the year 256 hijri and that is more correct, and that when he entered the cellar he was four, it was also said: five, and it was said: he entered in the year 275 hijri while he was seventeen. Allah knows best what\u2019s true from among this and may Allah have mercy on him.] (Wafiyat-ul-A`iyan Ibn Khallikan)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notice that the scholar above is a known man from Ahlul-Sunnah, yet he mentions Muhammad in the children of al-`Askari. In other words he mentions it although he doesn\u2019t really believe this individual was al-Mahdi nor does he believe his parents were divine Imams, similarly he mentions a couple of other so called Mahdies in his book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This dear readers is because the books of genealogy -or books of \u201cAnsab\u201d as they are known- are more like story books, these types of books are usually the most unreliable of books unlike books of Hadith or books of `Aqidah or Fiqh. The authors will record all that was mentioned historically about every personality they list out of academic integrity, in our case since a group of people claimed that al-Hasan had a son who disappeared, the scholars will mention this son, they will also mention his titles and Kuniyah in addition to any dates of birth or death they come across. Notice the scholar above for instance said \u201cMay Allah have mercy on him\u201d meaning that if he did in fact have this son then he is most likely dead in that so called cellar. The example of this is similar to the books that document Hadith narrators, otherwise known as books of \u201cRijal\u201d, these books will list what is known about the narrators of prophetic-traditions yet some of these narrators are completely unknown, some are in fact fictional characters, yet the scholars still include them in their compilations since they were previously mentioned as parts of certain chains or events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We leave the conclusions for the intelligent readers and peace be upon our Prophet and master Muhammad ibn `Abdillah and his Family and Companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Written by Hani bin Mulhim bin Amin bin Mulhim bin Khalil bin Ibrahim al-Tarabulsi.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The Shia Mahdi &#8211;The History Of Confusion&#8211; Download PDF (here) The belief in the \u201cmessiah\u201d is a widespread belief shared by the majority of religions, it is the belief that at the end of times we shall be delivered by <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2015\/10\/30\/the-shia-mahdi\/\" title=\"The Shia Mahdi: the history of confusion\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3905,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11,5],"tags":[16],"class_list":{"0":"post-2645","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-articles","8":"category-imamah","9":"tag-mahdi"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2645","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2645"}],"version-history":[{"count":15,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2645\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2652,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2645\/revisions\/2652"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3905"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2645"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2645"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2645"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
