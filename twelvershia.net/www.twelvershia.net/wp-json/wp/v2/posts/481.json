RTS started to interpret the words of Ibn Taymiyyah by imposing Shia preconceptions, for Ibn Taymiyyah did not mean to say that the Sunnis are the followers of the Twelve Imams, but rather, said that they are the followers of the Imams of Ahlulbayt. The wording may seem similar, but remember, Ibn Taymiyyah doesn\u2019t believe in the concept of Imamate in the first place, so it is natural for him to have a different understanding of the term \u201cAhlulbayt\u201d. Anyone who has read &#8220;Minhaaj al-Sunnah&#8221; in the first place will be aware that Ibn Taymiyyah mocks the very concept of there being a hidden twelfth Imam. We also know that he doesn\u2019t limit the Imams to the children of Al-Hussain (ra), but Ahlulbayt includes all the children of Ali and the children of Al-Abbas (ra) as well. RTS apparently has overlooked this fact even though it is very obvious from Ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s words.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Taymiyyah himself says on one occasion that the four Imams after Al-Redha were not known for knowledge. How is it possible that Ibn Taymiyyah meant that the Sunnis have taken knowledge from them when he says that they are not known for knowledge? Surely, such a thing is not logical, which leads us to the conclusion that Ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s definition of Ahlulbayt is different from that which is adopted by Twelvers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carrying on, RTS starts quoting several statements from scholars that imply that Ja\u2019far Al-Sadiq made mistakes, or was not at the same level as some other scholars of his time. RTS also quotes other narrations that show that the Imams are seen as inferior to other scholars. Here are some quotes by RTS:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Ibn Taymiyyah Regarding The Ahlulbayt (a.s)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">And likewise, most of the Imams of the people of Hadeeth like Malik, and Shi&#8217;ba, and Al-Thawri, and Ahmad bin Hanbal whoever knows their case knows a certain knowledge that they absolutely do not believe that any lie has occurred in the narration of the Prophet (saw) and they know that they (i.e. the narrators) do not commit mistakes except for one or two pronounciations. And from among them there are some who knows that he would commit mistakes in the Prophetic narration, for Ahmad bin Hanbal absolutely knew that he would commit mistakes in it, but neither Al-Thawri or Al-Zuhri did, and so did a lot of people other than them.\u00a0<strong>And those who know that they would commit mistakes like Himad bin Salama and Ja&#8217;far bin Mohammad (Imam Saddiq)<\/strong>\u00a0would know that their mistake would be something that would pass on and would be in occasions they would know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Jawab Al-I&#8217;tiraadhat Al-Masriya &#8216;Alal-Futya Al-Hamawiya.

There is a consensus among Sunni scholars that what Ibn Taymiyyah has said above is true, and that these scholars from Ahlulbayt were inferior to some of the scholars of their time. However, such a thing does not mean that we do not take knowledge from them. Similarly, no Sunni will disagree that Abu Bakr was superior to Omar, however, we take knowledge from both. There is no reason why Sunnis cannot see certain scholars as superior to Ja\u2019far Al-Sadiq while still choose to take knowledge from him.<br \/>\nRTS went on to quote various Sunni scholars casting doubt upon the reliability of Al-Redha, the eighth Shia Imam, and the Imams that came after him, then accuses Sunnis of not following Ahlulbayt. Again, we say that the Sunnis are the followers of Ali, Ibn Abbas, Ali bin Abdullah bin Al-Abbas, Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Al-Abbas, Mohamad bin Al-Hanafiya, Zaid bin Al-Hasan, Ali bin Al-Hussain, Mohammad bin Ali, Ja\u2019far bin Mohamad, and the list goes on and on. If RTS or any other Shias want to assert their definition on the term Ahlulbayt, then they are free to do so, given that they can provide proper evidence that it is a term that is exclusive to twelve people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Some important side-comments that do not revolve around the main topic:<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; RTS has not provided sufficient evidence that Abu Hanifah said that, \u201cWithout the two years Al-Numan would have perished.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8211; RTS criticizes Ibn Taymiyyah for saying that Ibn Abbas (ra) didn\u2019t take knowledge of Tafseer from Ali (ra), yet, the case is similar in Shia books, for very little of the Tafseer is authentically attributed to Ali (ra). In any case, Ibn Abbas (ra) not taking Tafseer knowledge from Ali (ra) does not contradict that he was a major scholar in Tafseer.<br \/>\n&#8211; RTS states that Ali (ra) collected the Qur\u2019an after the death of the Prophet (pbuh), but they provide no evidence or sources to prove this.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to the article on RevisitingtheSalaf entitled: They Punctured the Ark, which was published on the 11th\u00a0of May, 2012, and can be found\u00a0here.
