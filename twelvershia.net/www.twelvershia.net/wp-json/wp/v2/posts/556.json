contained 12,304 names of the companions, amongst them is a number of men and women whose companionship is not proven as Ibn Hajar pointed out. al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi said that there were 7,554 companions mentioned in Ibn al-Atheer&#8217;s book &#8220;Usud al-Ghabah fi Ma&#8217;arifat al-Sahaba&#8221;, al-Dhahabi then took the names of the Sahaba from Usud al-Ghabah and built upon that information and added more companions until the number reached 8,866 Tarjamah in his book &#8220;Tajrid Asmaa al-Sahaba&#8221; and he stated that some of them are not known and that the companionship of some of the men and women is not proven.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The &#8220;Tarjamah&#8221; is a quick short history of a person&#8217;s life which does not exceed a couple of lines, in our case we are talking about the companions so it&#8217;s some quick information about each companion such as when he died and what is his full name what is his Kuniyah and what was his job and some of his family members maybe, as opposed to the word &#8220;Seerah&#8221; because that is a lengthy detailed biography of a person such as the Seerah of the Prophet PBUH or the Seerah of Abu Bakr (ra) and they come in the form of large independent books.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now back to the topic, Ibn Hajar himself admits that the Sahaba mentioned in his book do not exceed the 1\/10th of the total number of companions. [al-Isabah 1\/2]<br \/>\nAs for Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i he mentioned that the number of Muslims during the death of the Prophet PBUH was 60,000 men and women, 30,000 in Madinah and 30,000 outside it. [al-Dhahabi&#8217;s Tajrid Asmaa al-Sahaba and Ibn Kathir&#8217;s Ikhtisar &#8216;Uloum al-Hadith]<br \/>\nThat is only guess work however and these numbers contradict with the Sahih narration which goes back to Abu Zara&#8217;ah and what is written in Sahih Bukhari and Muslim in the story of Tabuk is that the number of people was very big and no book or Diwan could contain them. The Sahih from the saying of Suffiyan al-Thawri (rah) is that the number of companions after the death of the Caliphate &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab(ra) was 12,000 after many of them had died in the wars and battles. [Al-Isabah 1\/3]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Hakim al-Nisaburi (rah) stated that the number of companions who narrated the Hadith from the prophet SAWS is 4,000 but al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi disagreed and said that they are about 1,500 and could never reach 2,000. [Tajrid Asmaa al-Sahaba]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for Ibn al-Jawzi (rah) he made a list of those companions who narrated Hadith and in it were 1,858 Sahaba (1,642 Sahabi and 216 Sahabiyah) and some of those narrations are not accepted. [Talqih Fuhoum Ahlul-Athar 284-361] And if we add the number of companions whom Imam Ahmad narrated from in his Musnad and they are (904) to the number of companions mentioned in the Musnad of Baqi that Ahmad never mentioned and they are (568) and add to them the number of companions that Abu Bakr al-Burqi added to the list of Baqi ibn Makhlad that both Ahmad and Baqi never mentioned and they are (87) Then add to them the number of companions that Ibn al-Jawzi collected from various other sources and they are (6) in total we would get (1,565) companions who narrated Hadiths and the companionship of some of the men in the Musnad of Baqi is not proven.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So we see that the estimation of al-Dhahabi is much more correct than that of al-Hakim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What are the Tabaqat of the companions?<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They differed in the number of Tabaqat(Classes), Ibn Sa\u2019ad (rah) adopted the position that there were only five Tabaqat and this is what he used in his book \u201cTabaqat Ibn Sa\u2019ad al-Kubra\u201d however the more correct position is that of al-Hakim (rah) and he placed twelve Tabaqat:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Those who came first into Islam in Mecca such as the first four Caliphs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Companions who entered Islam before the consultation of the people of Mecca in Darul-Nadwah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Those who made Hijrah to al-Habashah (Abyssinia).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- The Companions of the first \u2018Aqabah and they were twelve men from the Ansar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- The Companions of the second \u2018Aqabah and they were mainly from the Ansar except for Ibn Abbas (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- The Mouhajirun who reached the Prophet SAWS in Qubaa before he entered al-Madinah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- Ahlu-Badr (Soldiers who fought at the battle of Badr).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- Those who made Hijra between Badr and al-Hudaibiyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- Ahlu-Baya\u2019at al-Rudwan (Those who took the oath of fealty under the acacia tree at Hudaibiyah).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10- Those who made Hijrah between al-Hudaibiyah and Fath Mecca (conquest of Mecca) such as: Khalid ibn al-Walid and \u2018Amro bin al-\u2018Aas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11- Muslimat Fath, those who embraced Islam on the day of the conquest of Mecca.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">12- Those of them who were children and they saw the Prophet SAWS on the day of the conquest, the farewell sermon and other occasions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Who were the first to enter Islam?<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- From the free men: Abu bakr al-Siddiq (ra).<br \/>\n2- From the young kids: Ali ibn abi Talib (ra).<br \/>\n3- From the women: Khadija bint Khuwaylid (ra).<br \/>\n4- From the Mawali: Zaid bin Harithah (ra).<br \/>\n5- From the \u2018Abeed: Bilal ibn Rabah (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mawali are the non-Arabs at the time who were treated as second grade citizens by Quraysh and they were not allowed to participate in politics.<br \/>\nThe \u2018Abeed are the slaves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Who was the last companion to die?<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu al-Tufail \u2018Amir bin Wathilah al-Laythee died in the year 100 A.H and some said 102 and some said 107 and some said 110 A.H and this is what al-Dhahabi considered Sahih.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Who made the most Fatwas?<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is the prophet\u2019s SAWS cousin \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas (ra) then the biggest \u2018Ulema from amongst the companions, Ibn Masruq said: \u201cI investigated the companions of the Prophet SAWS and I found most knowledge in six individuals amongst them, they are: \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, \u2018Abdullah, Abu al-Dardaa, Ubay bin Ka\u2019ab and Zaid bin Thabit, Then I investigated more and I found most knowledge in two amongst the six: \u2018Ali and \u2018Abdullah.

similar Hadiths with different chains and the one narration usually has 20 or 30 or 80 chains of transmission also back in those days if they had one Hadith with three different chains they would consider it three different Hadiths.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example back then if I memorized these:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&gt; Yahya from Malik from Ja\u2019afar

Makhlad narrated from 1,013 companions but the companionship of many of the men and women found in Musnad Baqi is disputed and some of them were actually from the Tabi&#8217;een not the Sahaba as Ibn

&#8216;Umar (ra) while Baqi narrated around 2,210.<br \/>\nMu&#8217;ath Ibn Jabal (ra) has 157 in Baqi and 53 in Ahmad.<br \/>\nAnas ibn Malik (ra) has 2,286 in Baqi and 2,192 in Ahmad.<br \/>\nIn some cases Ahmad narrated more such as the Hadiths of Ali ibn abi Talib (ra), Ahmad narrated 819 from him and Baqi only narrated 586.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These differences in numbers are related mainly to the Turuq(chains) of the Hadith and not necessarily the Mutoun(texts) and it is unknown who narrated more of the Mutoun because Musnad Baqi ibn Makhlad was lost and only bits and pieces of it can be found in some museums.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Musnad Baqi ibn Makhlad is not taken from Musnad Ahmad even though Baqi was a student of Ahmad, Ibn Hazm who was able to get his hands on Musnad Baqi said:&#8221; Baqi narrated in it from 284 Sheikhs who are from the major scholars of their times and you cannot find 10 who are weak&#8221; while Ahmad narrated from 283 Sheikhs according to the research of al-Hafiz abu Musa al-Madini. al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi was able to obtain two volumes of Musnad Baqi and he said that none of its narrations are found within Musnad Ahmad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Musnad Ahmad contains less Ghareeb(strange) Hadiths.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- In terms of &#8216;Ulu al-Isnad: It means that the less the number of people in the Isnad to the Prophet SAWS the better and stronger the narration becomes and Ahmad (born 164 A.H died 241 A.H) was much better as he was from the Shuyoukh of Baqi (born around 201 A.H died 276 A.H).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- Musnad Ahmad is 127 volumes, Musnad Baqi is around 200 volumes but this does not mean that Musnad Baqi is bigger than that of Ahmad because that is decided by the type and thickness of paper and the font and the number of lines and such.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- They both differed regarding the companions who narrated less Hadith:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a-It is observed that many of the companions who narrated more than 20 Hadiths had their own Musnads and they are 121 companions that both Ahmad and Baqi agreed upon such as: Musnad Ali and Musnad Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Musnad Ibn Mas&#8217;oud&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">b-Those whom Baqi mentioned and Ahmad did not mention are 31 companions, aside from those who narrated threes and twos and ones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">c-Those whom Baqi mentioned and Ahmad did not mention from amongst the companions who narrated threes and twos are 82.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">d-Those whom Baqi mentioned and Ahmad did not mention from amongst the companions who narrated one Hadith are 334.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">e-In total Baqi made Takhreej for 568 companions which Ahmad never narrated from in his Musnad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">f-Ahmad on the other hand made Takhreej for 394 companions that Baqi never narrated from and this includes 89 unnamed companions such as &#8220;a Man&#8221; &#8220;Mother of somebody&#8221; &#8220;Uncle of somebody&#8221; &#8220;Grandfather of someone&#8221; ect&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also note that over 2\/3rd of Musnad Baqi was narrated from seventeen companions

&#8220;islamic-forum.net&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It seems that Shias are under the impression that we Sunnis get our religion from random companions that only converted for financial gains or for power. However, as many of you are aware, the vast majority of our narrations come from one of two groups, the Muhajireen, that risked their lives to come to Madinah for the sake of Islam, and the Ansar, who open their hearts to the calling of the Prophet (pbuh) and raised the name of the deen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shias, though, assume that most of what we have is from the \u201cMu\u2019alafati Quloobuhum.\u201d This is a term used to describe those that were hesitant to join Islam, and the Prophet (pbuh) used to reward them in the short term after battles in order for them to have a greater allegiance towards him. Now, there is no doubt that the Muhajireen and Ansar are greater in status than these late Sahabis, who mainly accepted Islam after the Conquest of Makkah, however, these &#8220;Mu\u2019alafati Quloobuhum&#8221;, are still multitudes greater in status than the rest of the Muslims, for they too have served the Prophet (pbuh) and raised the banner of Islam together.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In any case, I found a great list of the Mu\u2019alafa Quloobuhum and I wasn\u2019t aware that such a thing existed. You will notice that most of these companions are relatively unknown, even though there are a few whose names are familiar. Next to their names, I\u2019ve included the number of their narrations according to Ibn Hazm.
