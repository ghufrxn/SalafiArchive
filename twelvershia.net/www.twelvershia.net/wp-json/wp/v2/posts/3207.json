Plus, the author of the book Al-Imamah wal Siyasa, which is attributed to Ibn Qutaiba, is differed upon, with many academics rejecting the attribution of the book to him. Refer to Al-Awasim min Al-Qawasim (p. 167) by Ibn Al-Arabi where in which he casts doubt on this book. The editor, Muhib Al-Deen Al-Khateeb adds that Ibn Qutaiba never went to Egypt, while the book was written by someone that has been to Egypt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, we find it very clear that there is no tangible evidence that A\u2019isha was responsible for the death of Uthman, but rather, it is<em>\u00a0<\/em>well-established that A\u2019isha played a role in avenging Uthman.
