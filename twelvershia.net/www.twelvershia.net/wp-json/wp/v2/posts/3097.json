The narrator said: Abu Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke \u2018Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa\u2019d b. \u2018Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allaah, you want us (to speak)?\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The author is suggesting that Abu Bakr and Omar had no weight amongst the ranks of the companions by quoting this specific incident. However, simply because the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 rejected their consultation in a specific matter does not mean that they do not have any weight.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, Abu Bakr and Omar were not needed for consultation in this case because the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 had another motive when consulting his companions. Al-Nawawi comments in his explanation of this hadith: \u201cThe scholars have said: He \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 wanted to test the Ansar, for they have not given him the pledge to go out to war alongside him, but only to protect him from aggressors, so when he suggested heading to Abu Sufyan\u2019s camels and merchandise, he wanted to know if they would agree, and they did respond with the best answer in this time and in other times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The explanation provided by Al-Nawawi fills in the blanks and clears up what Sa\u2019ad bin Ubada meant by \u201cYou want us (to speak)?\u201d This suggests that he knew that the consultation was not meant for the sake of getting an opinion, but rather, wanting to know the status of the Ansar and the support that he would receive from them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Either way, Ibn Abbas narrates in Saheeh Muslim #3309, that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 continued to consult Abu Bakr and Omar specifically after the end of the battle of Badr, and this clearly affirms their status.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to Slave of Ahlubait\u2019s article: \u201cHoly Prophet (asws) did not pay attention to advice of Abu Bakar and Umar\u201d.
