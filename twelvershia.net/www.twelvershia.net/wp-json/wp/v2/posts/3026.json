The theme of jealousy was not uncommon.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A\u2019isha\u2019s Admittance of her Jealousy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before getting into that, we remind our readers that A\u2019isha herself narrated from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; that he said: \u201cThe best from amongst you are those that are the best of you to your wives, and I am the best from amongst you with his wives.\u201d Sunan Al-Tirmithi #3830. Al-Tirmithi authenticates this narration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is needless to say that the Prophet\u2019s \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 had the best of qualities and was revered for it by all those that surrounded him. It was not hard for those that were close to him to get attached to his nature and his wives were very much in love with him because of those qualities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The jealousy of A\u2019isha was not a well kept secret. Decades after the death of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 she would tell her nephew Urwa of how her jealousy drove her actions when she was much younger. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5565, a group of Jews pass by the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 and say, \u201cAl-Saam (death) be upon you\u201d A\u2019isha cursed them intensely by saying, \u201cAl-Saam and curses be upon you.\u201d The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 calms her down and advises her to show kindness even when faced with such people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Saheeh Muslim #5030, during A\u2019isha\u2019s \u201cnight\u201d, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 left her. When he returned, he asked, \u201cWhat is wrong A\u2019isha? Were you jealous (that I left)?\u201d She said: \u201cHow could someone like me not be made jealous over someone like you?!\u201d In a similar narration in Saheeh Muslim #750 she states that she thought that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 went to one of his other wives, and that drove her check up on him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A\u2019isha was immensely jealous of Khadijah, the deceased wife of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , since he had not loved any of his wives as much as he loved Khadijah. A\u2019isha in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #3532 said, \u201cI was not jealous of any of the Prophet\u2019s \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 wives as much as I was made jealous by Khadijah,\u201d for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 used to praise her even after her death. In another narration in Al-Bukhari #3536, A\u2019isha describes that she was jealous by the visitation of Khadijah\u2019s sister Haala, in which the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 seemed overjoyed since she reminded him of Khadijah. A\u2019isha, driven by jealousy, comments that Allah has replaced his \u201cold wife\u201d with a new one that is better than the old one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some narrations are even more explicit than others. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari #5234, A\u2019isha complains of a severe headache. The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 aware of his close death said, \u201cIf that happened while I was alive, I would ask forgiveness for you and supplicate to Allah for you.\u201d She said, \u201cI think you would like it for me to die, and if that happened, you would be having intercourse with one of your wives during that very night.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In one narration by Anas in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4824, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was in the house of A\u2019isha when Um Salama sent some food to him. A\u2019isha was filled with so much jealousy, that she broke the plate that the food was sent on. The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 did not rebuke her. He empathized with her and simply said to those that were present, \u201cYour mother (of the believers) was made jealous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though, as we\u2019ve mentioned above, what really got to A\u2019isha was that there were always a fear of an additional woman that she would have to share her husband with. She narrates in an authentic chain in Musnad Ahmad #25161 that Juwairiyah was a beautiful woman and that A\u2019isha hated her as soon as she saw her because she knew that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 would be attracted to her. Of course, her fears were confirmed when he eventually married her soon after.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In one heart-warming narration from Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4810, A\u2019isha and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2016\/02\/13\/hafsa-in-the-eyes-of-sunnis-and-shias\/\">Hafsa<\/a> are travelling with the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 while the rest of his wives were in Madinah, meaning that they would get more alone time with him. While on the way, Hafsa suggested to A\u2019isha that they should switch camels. A\u2019isha did not mind doing so. Though, it was night and the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 could not make them out. He approached A\u2019isha\u2019s camel thinking that it was being ridden by her. He met Hafsa, greeted her, and continued until they got off their camels, and perhaps even entered camp. A\u2019isha, filled with jealousy, got on the ground and cried, \u201cO\u2019 Allah, send a scorpion or a snake to bite me, for I am powerless to say anything to him!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Reasons for A\u2019isha\u2019s Jealousy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The very definition is often ignored by Shias when dissecting the actions of A\u2019isha and turning them against her, since much of her actions were driven by her extreme attachment to the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 and her love for him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The factors that drove this jealousy were many. Perhaps the most obvious of these factors is that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was married to multiple women. Now, having to share a man with one other woman is bad enough, let alone having to share her with several women. Keep in mind that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was fair with his wives and would give each one of his wives a \u201cnight\u201d. With that in mind, it was uncommon for A\u2019isha to not be with her husband for a whole week.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor was the age of A\u2019isha. As we find in authentic reports in the Saheehain through Urwa bin Al-Zubair and Al-Aswad, A\u2019isha was nine years old when her marriage to the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was consummated. With that in mind, she was the only teenager from amongst his wives. By the time the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 passed away, A\u2019isha was around eighteen years old.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor was that A\u2019isha was the only virgin from amongst the wives of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; . The rest of his wives were either divorced or widows. That perhaps made it easier for them to cope with having to share him, since they were married before, and were thankful that they had the chance to be married again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An important factor to keep in mind is that A\u2019isha was one of the earliest marriages. After the death of Khadijah, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 first married Sawda bint Zum\u2019a, who was in her fifties, then married A\u2019isha. So, for A\u2019isha, things simply grew worse every once in a while when the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 got married to someone new. It isn\u2019t so hard to understand that the first wife, in a regular marriage, would be filled with a lot more jealousy than the fourth wife, who is entering a marriage while being fully aware that she has to share her husband with three other women.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Context of Surat Al-Tahreem 1-12<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surat Al-Tahreem is often quoted by Shias in order to attack A\u2019isha and <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/02\/13\/hafsa-in-the-eyes-of-sunnis-and-shias\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Hafsa<\/a>. Firstly, it is important to be aware of the verses in question. Then, we will briefly provide the Shia argument, and end it off with providing the context behind the verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The verses from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchtruth.com\/chapter_display.php?chapter=66&amp;translator=5&amp;mac=\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Surat Al-Tahreem 1-12<\/a> are as follows:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allah is your Maula (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All-Knower, the All-Wise.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">And (remember) when the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives (Hafsah), then she told it (to another i.e. &#8216;Aishah). And Allah made it known to him; he informed part thereof and left a part. Then when he told her (Hafsah) thereof, she said: &#8220;Who told you this?&#8221; He said: &#8220;The All-Knower, the All-Aware (Allah) has told me.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you two (wives of the Prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 : &#8216;Aishah and Hafsah \u0631\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 likes); but if you help one another against him (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645), then verily, Allah is his Maula (Lord, or Master, or Protector), and Jibril (Gabriel), and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore, the angels are his helpers.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you &#8211; Muslims (who submit to Allah), believers, obedient (to Allah), turning to Allah in repentance, worshipping Allah sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants (for Allah&#8217;s sake), previously married and virgins.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">O you who believe!

Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Nuh (Noah) and the wife of Lut (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed them (their husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they [Nuh (Noah) and Lut (Lot) \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645] availed them (their respective wives) not against Allah and it was said: &#8220;Enter the Fire along with those who enter!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Allah has set forth an example for those who believe: the wife of Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh), when she said: &#8220;My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Fir&#8217;aun (Pharaoh) and his work, and save me from the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allah).<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of &#8216;Imran who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Ruh [i.e. Jibril (Gabriel) ], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of Allah: &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and he was; that is &#8216;\u00cesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of Allah], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qanitun (i.e. obedient to Allah) .<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shias, often go out of their way in order to prove that these verses suggest that A\u2019isha and Hafsa were disbelievers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though, one should always start by examining the context of the verses which can be found in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2288 which is narrated by Ibn Abbas through Omar and A\u2019isha. The narration starts off with Ibn Abbas asking Omar about the two women that are described in the verses above, suggesting that this was not common knowledge amongst the companions of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 even though many years have passed since the incident. Omar did not hold back by hiding the name of his beloved daughter, but immediately stated that the verses were about Hafsa and A\u2019isha. He then carried on with the narration, stating that he had issues with his wife\u2019s attitude, since she has become aggressive ever since coming to Madinah, since the women in Madinah were not as submissive as the Makkan women. His wife then lashed back at him one day, while claiming that the wives of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 would talk back to him and would give him the silent treatment. Omar, shocked, rushed to Hafsa, wondering if she treated the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 in such a manner. She admitted that she did. Omar, then, advised her not do so, then went back home. Then, one night, there was a knock on the door, and Omar opened up to hear news that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 divorced his wives. Omar entered upon Hafsa and found her crying. Hafsa then said that she was not unsure if he did.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Omar then explained to Ibn Abbas that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 isolated himself from his wives for twenty-nine days, and that he did this when Hafsa shared her \u201csecret\u201d with A\u2019isha.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though Omar does not go into the details of what happened, A\u2019isha herself does include those details in another hadith in Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4531. She states that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 used to drink honey when he was at Zaynab bin Jahsh\u2019s house. So, A\u2019isha and Hafsa, driven by jealousy, agreed to ask him if he ate <em>maghafeer<\/em>, which is a plant with a foul smell. When Hafsa carried that out, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 decided to forbid honey upon himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why did he do this? It was out of his love for Hafsa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first verse in Surat Al-Tahreem states: O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you, seeking to <strong>please your wives?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then said, \u201cI swear that you will not tell anyone about this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hafsa, however, did speak of this to A\u2019isha, as Omar stated above, and thus, the verses were revealed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By returning to Saheeh Al-Bukhari #2288 we find the conclusion of the events. It was after those twenty-nine days that Allah revealed the Verse of <em>Takhyeer<\/em>, in which the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 gave his wives the option to choose to a divorce. The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 suggested that she should consult her parents before making a decision, he then recited:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">O Prophet (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645)! Say to your wives: &#8220;If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;But if you desire Allah and His Messenger, and the home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allah has prepared for Al-Muhsinat (good-doers) amongst you an enormous reward.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Surat Al-Ahzab 28-29<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A\u2019isha said, \u201cIn a matter such as this would I need to consult my parents?! I want Allah, want Allah, His messenger, and the home of the Hereafter.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Allegations and Responses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shias often present portions of the verses that state that their \u201chearts were inclined\u201d against the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 or against truth. They would also argue that Allah and the angels are the allies of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , suggesting that A\u2019isha and Hafsa were not his allies. Furthermore, verse ten in the <em>surah<\/em> speaks of two evil wives of the previous prophets, suggesting that A\u2019isha and Hafsa were evil in nature as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shias will also use verse five against A\u2019isha and Hafsa. They\u2019ll argue that Allah stated that he would provide the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 with wives that were \u201cbelievers\u201d in order to suggest that A\u2019isha and Hafsa were not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, all of these suggestions are easily diffused by pointing to the fact that the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 stayed married to both A\u2019isha and Hafsa. This suggests that A\u2019isha and Hafsa repented, as per Allah\u2019s order in verse four. The Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 aware of their repentance, died while being bound to them because of his love for them. The intelligent Sunni will simply ask Shias: Why didn\u2019t the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 divorce them if Allah had declared them to be disbelievers? Shias will have no good response. They will argue that the wives of Nuh and Lut were the same, though, Shias would need to prove that Allah has declared to Nuh and Lut that their wives were disbelievers, and there is no evidence that they were privy to that information.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, if Shias want to argue context, we will of course point them to verse eight, in which Allah commands the believers to repent, in the same way that he ordered A\u2019isha and Hafsa to repent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shias will also argue that Allah could substitute them with wives who were \u201cbelievers\u201d, suggesting that they were not believers. In response, we say that this does not negate that A\u2019isha and Hafsa were both believers for the verse also states that Allah could substitute them with \u201cvirgins\u201d and \u201cpreviously married women\u201d too, and those descriptions undeniably fit A\u2019isha, who was the only virgin from amongst the wives of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; , while Hafsa had a previous husband.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, by returning to the origin of the issue, we realize that what caused this ordeal was caused by none other than jealousy. It was due to the love that A\u2019isha and Hafsa had for the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 that drove them to overstepping their bounds and fall into sin. Of course, a Shia with darkness in his heart will attempt to overlook that while likening the actions of A\u2019isha and Hafsa to the worst of disbelievers who rejected Allah and His messenger.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps it is best to ask this one question that Shias will never have a good answer for: What did the Muslim <em>ummah<\/em> gain from the Prophet\u2019s \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 marriage from A\u2019isha and Hafsa if they were disbelievers? A realistic answer should be: Nothing more than the misguidance of 90% of the Muslim <em>ummah<\/em> who were led to believe that A\u2019isha\u2019s and Hafsa\u2019s version of Islam is what the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was upon, and henceforth, causing misguidance to the majority of the Muslims who will end upon in hellfire for all eternity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nail in the coffin for Shias that will not empathize with jealous wives is this authentic narration from Ja&#8217;afar Al-Sadiq:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3030 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"aisha jealousy\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/aisha-jealousy-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>Ishaq bin Ammar said to Abu Abdullah (as): &#8220;A woman annoys a man due to her jealousy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He (as) said: &#8220;That is because of her love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&#8211; Al-Kafi 5\/1123<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Unlike our usual content, in which we provide refutation upon refutation to every little point that is brought up by Shias, in this article, we will briefly be discussing the jealousy of the Mother of Believers A\u2019isha and the verses <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2016\/02\/11\/aishas-jealousy-and-surat-al-tahreem\/\" title=\"A&#8217;isha&#8217;s Jealousy and Surat Al-Tahreem\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3030,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11,1,4],"tags":[],"class_list":{"0":"post-3026","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-articles","8":"category-hadith","9":"category-quran"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3026","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3026"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3026\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4260,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3026\/revisions\/4260"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3030"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3026"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3026"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3026"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
