Ibn Katheer, Hamza, Abu Amr an Aasim recited the phrase in genitive and Nafi\u2019, ibn Aamir and Aasim recited it in accusative. Reciting it in genitive determined that (your feet) was coupled to (your heads) and then as it was obligatory to wipe the head it would be obligatory to wipe the feet. As for reciting it in accusative, it also determined that it was obligatory to wipe the feet because the saying (and wipe your heads) made (your heads) as object and (your feet) was coupled to (your heads) so both of them were objects of the verb (wipe)\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: Even though Fakhruddin Ar-Razi said it but he is not the only person to be looked at in matters of Quranic interpretations. In fact, wiping is not necessitated in case of any of the two recitations; with <em>Jar<\/em> or with <em>Nasb<\/em>. Basically there are three types of recitation of the phrase \u201c<em>wa arjulakum<\/em>\u201d two of which are Mutawatir and the third one is <em>shaadh<\/em> (unreliable):<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>With <em>Nasb<\/em> I.e. <em>Wa arjulakum<\/em>. This is the recitation of Nafe, Ibn Amir, Hafs, Kisai and Yaqoob among the famous reciters of Quran.<\/li>\n<li>With <em>Jarr<\/em> I.e. <em>wa arjulikum<\/em>. This is the recitation of Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr, Hamza and Abu Bakr from Aasim.<\/li>\n<li>With <em>Damma<\/em> I.e. <em>wa arjulukum<\/em>. This is attributed to Hasan. This is unreliable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>RECITATION WITH <em>NASB<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the most prevalent recitation as it is the recitation of Hafs who has narrated it from Aasim. The implication derived from this recitation is that the object ((your feet)) is linked with the command of washing as the <em>I\u2019arab<\/em> it has is the <em>I\u2019irab<\/em> of the body parts which are to be washed mentioned in the verse. This differs with the <em>I\u2019irab<\/em> of portion asked to be wiped.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, apparently this is a command for washing the feet. This is how early exegetes have interpreted it. However, some of the scholars, excluding Shia scholars, have claimed that even this recitation supports wiping because there cannot occur a third phrase between <em>ma\u2019toof<\/em> and <em>ma\u2019toof alaih<\/em>. This was the opinion of Ar-Razi and Ibn Hazm. However, this is not supported by facts as we shall see.

It is also illogical to raise objection on this interpretation as early companions and <em>Tab\u2019een<\/em> have interpreted it as such and they were the people of this language.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is the list of those scholars from <em>Sahaba<\/em> and <em>Taba&#8217;een<\/em> who have interpreted it as such, as opposed to the unreliable claims of Ibn Hazm and Ar-Razi:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abdullah b.

Besides them a huge number of early commentators of Quran also did not see it problematic. In conclusion, the objection raised on this interpretation is unreliable and that is why most of the scholars did not pay any attention towards it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>RECITATION WITH <em>KASRA<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second <em>mutawatir<\/em> way of reciting it is with the <em>Kasra<\/em> on <em>Laam<\/em> I.e. <em>wa arjulikum<\/em>. Based on this recitation many scholars have interpreted it to mean wiping of the feet. The most apparent conclusion drawn from this recitation is that the feet should be wiped because the Arabic for feet takes the <em>I&#8217;arab<\/em> of the head and also coming in succession to it which is commanded to be wiped. Even though it is the first possibility with this recitation but it is not the only possibility with this recitation. We have to interpret a verse by looking at the practice and command of the Prophet (sallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Reason for interpreting the particular reading against the most apparent meaning :<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both the recitations are <em>Mutawatir<\/em> and hence they can only interpret and cannot overrule each other, therefore interpreting one with washing and another with wiping in the same condition is not possible. Hence what we have to do is to look into traditions and which of the two interpretations are correct in light of the actions and sayings of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). As Allah (subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala) states in Quran:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0651\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e \u0644\u0650\u062a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064f\u0632\u0651\u0650\u0644\u064e<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0643\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Surat An-Nahl 44]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201c And\u00a0 We\u00a0 revealed\u00a0 to\u00a0 you\u00a0 the message\u00a0 that<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">you\u00a0 may\u00a0 make\u00a0 clear to\u00a0 the\u00a0 people\u00a0 what\u00a0 was<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">sent\u00a0 down\u00a0 to\u00a0 them\u00a0 and\u00a0 that they might\u00a0 give\u00a0 thought.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence it was the duty of the Prophet (sallahu alahi wa sallam) to interpret the Quran for us. So when we look at his actions and sayings we see that he always washed his feet and commanded to do so. Narrations of washing are so many that <em>Tawatur<\/em> can easily be claimed regarding it. On the other hand there is not a single authentic narration which shows wiping of the feet by Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). [Authenticity of different narrations will be discussed in the next section]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since we are now sure about the interpretation given by the Prophet (sallahu alaihi wa sallam), hence we need to interpret the verse in light of it. We see that the recitation with <em>Nasb<\/em> and the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) both clearly supports washing, so the problem remains with the other recitation which is with <em>Kasra<\/em>. We now look at the possibility of interpreting it in light of other clear evidence. We find the following answers to the problem which are in line with language, logic and textual evidence:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>The <em>Kasra<\/em> is due to its proximity with the nearby word. Or,<\/li>\n<li>The <em>\u201cMasH\u201d<\/em> mentioned with regards to feet is light washing of them.<\/li>\n<li>The wudu method, in this particular recitation, is regarding travellers and therefore wiping is prescribed over socks in this verse.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will expand these answers one by one, Insha Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em><u>Jarr \u2018ala al-Jiwar<\/u><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This means a word accepts <em>Kasra<\/em> or <em>Jarr<\/em> of the nearby word even if technically it should not have been <em>Majroor <\/em>(affected by Jarr). Many of the scholars have admitted its possibility in Arabic language while some have objected to it. Those who pointed out its possibility include the grammarian al-Akhfash and Abu Ubaidah. Besides them other scholars who have pointed out its possibility include As-Samarqandi, AlBaghwi, al-Bayhaqi, An-Nasafi, Ath-Tha&#8217;albi, Jalal al-Muhalli, Ibn Jawzi, Ibn Katheer, Al-Aalusi, Ash-Shinqiti etc. [Refer to their <em>Tafaseer<\/em> under the commentary of the verse of wudu]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ar-Razi was one of those who totally denied any existence of it in Qur\u2019an and so he was quoted by the Shi&#8217;as like Abdul Husain. Following are the objections of Ar-Razi:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Such usage in Arabic is considered <em>Lahn<\/em> (weakness in speech).<\/li>\n<li>It is done only when there is no possibility of confusion for readers.<\/li>\n<li>It occurs without <em>\u2018Atf<\/em>. (I.e. waw)<\/li>\n<li>Interruption between <em>ma\u2019toof<\/em> and <em>ma\u2019toof alaih<\/em> by a non-relevant phrase or sentence is disliked even in common speech.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scholars like Mahmud al-Aalusi and Muhammad Amin Ash-Shinqiti have answered these claims in detail. I&#8217;ll be presenting the summary of their response here point by point, Insha Allah.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>The great grammarians like Al-Akhfash, Abul Baqa and all the specialists of Arabic language have approved of the existence of it and no one denied it except Az-Zajjaj. His denial after his affirmation of the existence of <em>Jarr ala al-Jiwar<\/em> in their speeches indicates the lack of research from his side.<\/li>\n<li>To claim that it is from the condition of <em>Jarr \u2019ala al-Jiwar<\/em> that the matter is not confused, is not accepted as the grammarians have not mentioned any such rule. Yes, some of them have mentioned it as a condition for the beauty in <em>Kalam<\/em> (speech) with the condition which is fulfilled here, and that is this portion which is asked to be wiped is limited with the ankles and wiping do not occur with limit in Arabic speech.<\/li>\n<li>Scholars have pointed out its occurrence even with <em>Atf<\/em>. See the Tafsir <em>Ruh al-Ma&#8217;ani<\/em> by the Mufti of Baghdad Allama Mahmud al-Aalusi and <em>Adwa alBayan<\/em> by Allama Shinqiti for examples of such usage in Arabic.<\/li>\n<li>It causes effect only when the interpolated portion is totally irrelevant which is not the case here is. Besides, examples have already been given of such usage while discussing the recitation with <em>Nasb<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em><u>MasH<\/u><\/em><\/strong><strong><u> \u00a0here means washing<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another answer which many of the commentators of Quran have pointed out that \u0645\u0633\u062d in reference to feet means (a little) washing. This was pointed out by Abu Zaid al-Ansari and Abu Hatim As-Sijistani among the scholars of Arabic language.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If it is said that how could a single word in a sentence have two meanings? How \u0645\u0633\u062d for head is wiping and for feet is washing in the same verse? The answer is, it is possible that real meaning of a word and its metaphorical meaning be combined in a single sentence. Quran mentions:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0622\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0651\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0629\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0645\u0652<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0633\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u062d\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064f\u0646\u064f\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0631\u0650\u064a \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064d \u062d\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u062a\u064e\u063a\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0633\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Surat An-Nisa 43]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201c O\u00a0 you\u00a0 who\u00a0 have\u00a0 believed,\u00a0 do\u00a0 not\u00a0 approach\u00a0 prayer\u00a0 while\u00a0 you<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">are\u00a0 intoxicated\u00a0 until\u00a0 you know\u00a0 what\u00a0 you\u00a0 are\u00a0 saying\u00a0 or\u00a0 in\u00a0 a<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">state\u00a0 of\u00a0 janabah,\u00a0 except\u00a0 those\u00a0 passing\u00a0 through\u00a0 [a place\u00a0 of<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">prayer]&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the above verse, a same word \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 (salaah) is used once for prayer and secondly for Masjid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also to be noted that the verse of Wudu was revealed years after the Wudu was prescribed, and hence there was no possibility for confusion. Besides the limit prescribed in the verse for the feet which is till ankles, supports this view as in Arabic limits are not given for wiping. See <em>Tafaseer<\/em> mentioned earlier.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The wiping is over socks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many scholars have mentioned this. This is very much plausible considering the fact that a verse when comes with different <em>mutawatir<\/em> readings then both readings, by rule, are separately taken as two different verse while deriving the rulings. Hence, with <em>Nasb<\/em> it is for person under normal condition while with <em>Kasra<\/em> it is for those travelling while wearing socks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If it is said, what is the basis for this, the answer would be: The basis is all those narrations which mention washing for normal condition and wiping over socks, which are explicit and they are not singular reports which could be rejected by calling them mistakes or forgeries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, the basis is the verse itself where if the \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062d is taken in general then it will contradict the other proven recitation.
