This theme is not exclusive to Sunni sources; rather, it can be observed authentically reported in the hadith collections of other Shi&#8217;ite schools, as presented in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This narrative, however, contradicts with contemporary Twelver theology, which asserts that all of &#8216;Ali&#8217;s enemies were apostates. Twelver theologians and polemicists thus varied in their responses to this report as they attempted to wiggle their way out of its implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twelver theologian, Al-Hurr Al-&#8216;Ameli, seemed to have recognized that this report is irreconcilable with Twelver theology. Thus, he commented on it saying: &#8221; This is interpreted in light of <em>Taqiyyah&#8221;<\/em> (Al-&#8216;Ameli 15\/83)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-&#8216;Ameli&#8217;s attempt to pull the &#8220;<em>Taqiyyah <\/em>card&#8221; is futile: the report is transmitted through various independent routes, and it is definitely authentic to &#8216;Ali, who was the Caliph. &#8216;Ali did not need to employ <em>Taqiyyah<\/em>, since he was the leader at the time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, this attempt to bypass the report ironically backfires against itself. Later Twelver transmitters fabricated reports that appropriated &#8216;Ali&#8217;s statement. These reports can be found in two sources:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sixth century Twelver theologian, Al-Tabarsi (d. 548), cited a report that attempts to reconcile this hadith with later Twelver theology. It must be noted that this report <u class=\"remove-format\">does not have an isnad<\/u>. There is a 4.5 century disconnection in its transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Tabarsi (d. 548) said: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>A man from the people of Basrah came to &#8216;Ali b. Al-Hussain [d. 95], and said: &#8220;O &#8216;Ali b. Al-Hussain, your grandfather, &#8216;Ali b. Abi Taleb, killed believers!&#8221;<\/p><p>&#8216;Ali b. Al-Hussain&#8217;s eyes thus teared till his hands were filled with tears, and he then slammed them on the sand. He said: &#8220;O brother of the people of Basrah! No! By Allah, &#8216;Ali never killed a believer. He never killed a Muslim. The people had not accepted Islam. Rather, they merely submitted, concealed their kufr and presented themselves as Muslims. <\/p><p>When they found proponents of Kufr, they made it apparent. The woman of the camel (&#8216;Aisha) and the trusted individuals from Muhammad&#8217;s household knew that the people of the Camel, Siffin and Al-Nahrawan were cursed upon the tongue of Muhammad; and he he has failed who invents falsehood!&#8221;<\/p><p>A man from Kufah then said: &#8220;O Ali b. Al-Hussain, your grandfather used to say: they are our brothers who have transgressed against us!&#8221;<\/p><p>&#8216;Ali b. Al-Hussain thus said: &#8220;Have you not read the Book of Allah [where he said]: ( And to &#8216;Aad [We sent] their brother Hud) [Quran 7:65]?<\/p><p>They are like them. Allah saved Hud and those with him, and he destoryed &#8216;Aad.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Al-Ihtijaj 2\/40<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This entire account is an embellished polemical fabrication that unsurprisingly has no isnad. The disconnection in its isnad is more than 4.5 centuries long: it simply is a pathetic attempt by a later Shi&#8217;ite polemicist to provide a Twelver-friendly explanation of &#8216;Ali&#8217;s statement..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Al-<em>Tafsir Al-Safi<\/em>, Al-Ayyashi (d. 320) mentioned a brief excerpt from this report (Al-&#8216;Ayyashi 2:150). Needless to say, the transmission of this report is similarly disconnected. Al-&#8216;Ayyashi directly quoted Mufaddal b. &#8216;Umar (d. before 183), who was a severely criticized transmitter he never met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These later forgeries that attempted to appropriate &#8216;Ali&#8217;s statement ultimately decontextualized it, since Ali explicitly negated disbelief and hypocrisy from his opponents and enemies in the authentic reports from various sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As evident, this later Twelver attempt to appropriate the report is futile due to the dubious transmission of the cited report. Similarly, it directly conflicts with Al-&#8216;Ameli&#8217;s claim that this report was merely uttered out of <em>Taqiyyah<\/em>. It demonstrates how Twelver scholarship will arbitrarily pull the &#8220;<em>Taqiyyah<\/em> card&#8221; whenever faced with reports that conflict with Twelver theology.  (We have further elaborated on this phenomenon in this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/25\/taqiyyah-hadith-the-no-true-scotsman-fallacy\/\">article<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the appeals to these baseless reports and the appeal to <em>Taqiyyah<\/em> are mutually exclusive, and the Shi&#8217;ite polemicist cannot have his cake and eat it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems as though Twlevers simply have a hard time accepting the fact that Ali is authentically reported to have openly absolved his opponents from disbelief. Various polemical Twelver cop-outs are thus presented to bypass this explicit and authentic report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are dealing with false claimants to &#8216;Ali&#8217;s legacy who will actively bypass and deflect any authentic statement of his that conflicts with the theology later laid out by Twelver theologians.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, we observe how an authentically reported statement of &#8216;Ali in Sunni, Twelver, Zaidi, and Isma&#8217;ili sources is deflected by Twelvers today. Some attempted to deflect it by claiming it was merely an instance of &#8220;<em>Taqiyyah<\/em>.&#8221; Others cited fabrications that decontextualized &#8216;Ali&#8217;s statement and appropriated it to Twelver theology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proponents of both arguments, nevertheless, share one common trait: the desire to project their preconceived (Twelver) theology onto the statements and actions of the Imams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p> And when it is said to them, &#8220;Follow what Allah has revealed,&#8221; they reply, &#8220;No!
