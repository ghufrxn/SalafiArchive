The book provides a dissection of many of the differences between the Sunni and Shia sects.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The author, may Allah preserve him, writes in his introduction:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Praise be to\u00a0 Allah, Lord\u00a0 of the\u00a0 worlds. Peace and\u00a0 blessings be\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 most noble of the Messengers, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions. I\u00a0 dedicate\u00a0 this paper to\u00a0 every\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 who\u00a0 is\u00a0 willing to\u00a0 listen\u00a0 to\u00a0 constructive\u00a0 criticism with an open heart and an enlightened mind. This research is, in fact, a\u00a0 survey of the literature about the rise and spread\u00a0 of Shiism and its\u00a0 fundamental\u00a0 principles. Much of what follows is taken directly from Shia sources. Details of\u00a0 all the sources I have used are recorded in footnotes where interested readers will\u00a0 find page and volume numbers of the works cited. Anyone who wishes may then\u00a0 refer to the original Shia works and check what I have said. I would\u00a0 like to\u00a0 stress that I\u00a0 do\u00a0 not\u00a0 intend\u00a0 to\u00a0 imply\u00a0 that\u00a0 every\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 must\u00a0 necessarily believe everything\u00a0 that\u00a0 I\u00a0 have reported\u00a0 about\u00a0 their\u00a0 beliefs\u00a0 and\u00a0 doctrines. My intention is simply to make clear to every Shia what the books of\u00a0 their\u00a0 religious\u00a0 leaders contain.\u00a0These\u00a0 are\u00a0 things\u00a0 that\u00a0 many\u00a0 people\u00a0 still\u00a0 do\u00a0 not\u00a0 realize.\u00a0 My intention\u00a0 is\u00a0 to maintain an\u00a0 objective\u00a0 position,\u00a0 far\u00a0 from\u00a0 bigotry\u00a0 and\u00a0 blind allegiance to traditions. My only reason for writing it is to earn the pleasure\u00a0 of Allah and to clarify the truth to all who are interested to hear it. We should all\u00a0 free ourselves from prejudice and wild ideas, and avoid making inflammatory and\u00a0 insulting\u00a0 charges\u00a0 that\u00a0 fuel\u00a0 the\u00a0 emotions,\u00a0 block\u00a0 the path\u00a0 to\u00a0 truth,\u00a0 and\u00a0 widen\u00a0 the\u00a0 chasm between us. These things do nothing but dissipate the spirit of peace and harmony. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>I am firmly convinced that\u00a0 we\u00a0 must begin\u00a0 with\u00a0 a sincere\u00a0 commitment\u00a0 to\u00a0 truth\u00a0 and believe that the struggle between truth and\u00a0 falsehood will continue until the\u00a0 Day of\u00a0Resurrection.\u00a0 I\u00a0 am\u00a0 also\u00a0 convinced\u00a0 that truth\u00a0 must\u00a0 be presented\u00a0 without\u00a0 recourse to insults, curses or profanity. Allah has commanded us to observe the highest standards of dignity and\u00a0 self-respect\u00a0 when we argue\u00a0 with the\u00a0 &#8220;People of\u00a0 the Book.&#8221; Therefore, it is fitting for us to show even more respect to the people\u00a0 of\u00a0 our\u00a0 Book\u00a0 when\u00a0 we\u00a0 come to\u00a0disagree with them\u00a0 and\u00a0 discuss\u00a0 these\u00a0 disagreements. I look forward to the day when Allah joins our two communities with His Book\u00a0 and the\u00a0 Sunnah\u00a0 of His Messenger. May Allah hasten the day when He binds our\u00a0 hearts together again, after this long and bitter separation that has only benefited\u00a0 the enemies of the Muslims, and given them an ugly advantage from the beginning of our estrangement right up to today.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The author, may Allah preserve him, has organized his book into the following chapters:<\/p>\n<p>1- Doctrines of the Sunnis and Shias Compared<\/p>\n<p>2- The Sources of the Sunnah<\/p>\n<p>3- Pilgrimage to Graves and to the Shrines of the Imams<\/p>\n<p>4- On Infallibility<\/p>\n<p>5- The Companions of the Prophet<\/p>\n<p>6- The Imamate According to the Shias<\/p>\n<p>7- The Mutual Love Between Ali and the Companions<\/p>\n<p>8- Who Killed Al-Husayn?<\/p>\n<p>9- Temporary Marriage<\/p>\n<p>10- Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)<\/p>\n<p>11- The Twelfth Imam: Al-Mahdi<\/p>\n<p>12- The Doctrine of Manifest Knowledge and Other Innovations<\/p>\n<p>13- The Shias in History<\/p>\n<p>14- The Shias Today<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The e-book can be downloaded by clicking on the link below:<\/p>\n<iframe src=\"\/\/docs.google.com\/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwelvershia.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F10%2FSNNI-SHIAH-DIALOGUE.pdf&hl=en_US&embedded=true\" class=\"gde-frame\" style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border: none;\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<p class=\"gde-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SNNI-SHIAH-DIALOGUE.pdf\" class=\"gde-link\">Download (PDF, 1.14MB)<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem, The following is an e-book by Dr. Abdulrahman Dimashqiah, the renowned Sunni apologist.
