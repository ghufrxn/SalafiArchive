The article can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/ahlubait.wordpress.com\/2010\/07\/18\/mawia-the-drinkersahih-narration\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this short article, SoA quotes the following narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Abdullah bin Buraida said that I went to Mawia alongwith my father; Mawia made us sit on the floor with respect; food was brought for us; and that was followed by drink (wine); Mawia drank it; and gave it to my father; my father replied that he has not drink it from the time Holy Prophet has forbidden it; Mawia said that I was the most beautiful man of Quraish with smart neck; and did not enjoy anything other than milk and nice conversation<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the narration appears to imply that what was brought was indeed an intoxicant, there is an alternative interpretation that we would rather share. Firstly, the narration does not say that the drink that was brought was wine. It simply says that a drink was brought.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Buraida says that he didn\u2019t drink \u201cit\u201d since the time of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), it appears as though he is talking about intoxicants in general. It is not necessary that he is talking about the drink that was brought to them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It seems as though the drink that was brought was milk, since Mu\u2019awiyah himself is praising milk and saying that it is his favorite drink ever since he was young. It is not likely for Mu\u2019awiyah to be praising milk and saying that he enjoys nothing but milk while he is drinking an intoxicant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, even though this interpretation may seem farfetched, it is supported by the following tradition from Ibn Abi Shaybah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u062f \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u062f\u062e\u0644\u062a \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0623\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0623\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u0623\u0637\u0639\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u0634\u0631\u0628 \u060c \u0641\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0626 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0644\u0630\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u0623\u062e\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646 \u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646\u064a \u0622\u062e\u0630\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0622\u062e\u0630\u0647 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy father and I entered upon Mu\u2019awiyah, and he made us sit on the bed and brought us some food and drink. He then drank. Then he said: There is nothing that I enjoyed as a young man that I still consume today like <em>laban<\/em> (milk), for I consume today like I consumed it in the past, and a good conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the text shows, the first narration includes a conversation about intoxicants that isn\u2019t present in the second narration. The second narration clearly dictates that it is milk that was consumed during this conversation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another reason to hold the view that Mu\u2019awiyah did not consume intoxicants is because he is one of the Sahaba that ordered the lashing of those that drank alcohol. See Musnad Ahmad #16244, #16256, #16265, #16283, and #16318.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, it is not fathomable that he would narrate such narrations and drink it, while at the same time randomly be praising milk in the same narration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cMawia Drinking what was Prohibited by Holy Prophet\u201d.
