This summarized translation contains the names of the companions who wrote the Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) according to the research of the author.

A third collection was reported to be in the possession of Hijr ibn `Adi.<br \/>\nFrom those who wrote the narrations of `Ali were al-Hassan bin `Ali, al-Harith al-A`war and Hijr bin `Adi bin Jabalah.<br \/>\nKhallas bin `Amro al-Hijri received some of the Suhuf of `Ali according to Abu al-Walid al-Bajili and Ahmad ibn Hanbal said that Khallas narrated from `Ali through a book.<br \/>\nAs for al-Shu`bi and `Ata&#8217; bin abi Rabah their narrations from `Ali were also through a book.<br \/>\n`Abdullah ibn `Abbas also had his Hadith in written format.<br \/>\nShu`bah said: &#8220;Mujahid from `Ali and `Ata&#8217; from `Ali are (both) taken only from a book.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>42-`Umar ibn al-Khattab (raa)\u00a0<em>(40.BH &#8211; 23.AH)<\/em>:<\/strong>\u00a0The adviser of The Prophet (SAWS) and the first man to be called Ameer al-Mumineen or &#8220;The chief of believers&#8221;.<br \/>\n`Urwah bin al-Zubair narrated that `Umar bin al-Khattab wanted to write the prophetic narrations, so he consulted with the companions of the Prophet (SAWS) and they advised him to write it, he then kept making Istikhara during an entire month, then one morning he made his decision, he told them: &#8220;I wanted to write down the Sunan, but I remembered nations before you, they wrote books and read them constantly and abandoned the book of Allah (swt), and by Allah I do not consider the book of Allah to be second to any other.&#8221;<br \/>\nIn another Hadith it was reported by al-Qassem bin Muhammad that he burned some books of Sunnah because he believed that the Quran was the best book and didn&#8217;t want his followers to follow in the footsteps of Ahlul-Kitab.<br \/>\nIn another narration it was reported that `Umar asked the companions not to narrate a lot about the days of the prophet (SAWS) in order to give priority to the book of Allah, and so that the people may concentrate on it to preserve its meaning and text, as opposed to the Hadith which can be memorized in terms of its meaning and not necessarily a word for word memorization of the text. Which is why he once got into an argument with Abu Huraira and Ubay bin Ka`b and Abu Dharr and Abu al-Darda&#8217; because they narrated a lot. This does not mean that their relation was bad, since `Umar in his final days would send Abu Huraira as a judge and Imam of prayer to the people of Bahrain.<br \/>\nal-Darami said while commenting on the narration above: &#8220;It means not to narrate a lot about the days of the Prophet (SAWS) and not his traditions and orders.&#8221;<br \/>\nWhich is backed by the narration of `Umar ibn al-Khattab: &#8220;Lessen the amount of narrations from the Prophet (SAWS) except for what people work with.&#8221;<br \/>\nMeaning things like orders and prohibitions.<br \/>\nAnd all these narrations are weak either way.<br \/>\nOn the other hand it was reported that `Umar ibn al-Khattab sent Ibn Mas`oud to Kufa as a teacher and an adviser and he praised his knowledge. Which means he sent him to teach religion.<br \/>\nAnd he has great reputation when it comes to spreading the Sunnah in all Muslim lands, it was reported that he said in his sermon in his final days:<br \/>\n&#8220;&#8230;O Allah you are my witness on my governors in the lands, I have sent them to teach people the religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet (SAWS)&#8230;&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd `Umar said to al-Rabi` bin Ziyad: &#8220;I did not appoint my governors over you so they can beat you or insult you or take your money, I have appointed them to teach you the book of your Lord and the Sunnah of your Prophet, so whomever among you was oppressed by my governor, he should come and complain to me and I will judge.&#8221;<br \/>\nAbu Musa al-Ash`ari told the people when he reached al-Basara: &#8220;`Umar bin al-Khattab sent me to you in order to teach you the book of your Lord and the Sunnah.&#8221;<br \/>\nMuwariq al-`Ajali said: `Umar said: &#8220;Teach the traditions and obligatory orders just like you teach the Quran.&#8221;<br \/>\nHe also wrote narrations in order to be used in official sermons, Abu `Uthman narrated: &#8220;We were with `Utbah bin Farkad (in Azerbaijan) so `Umar wrote him things from the Prophet (SAWS) and among them was: None wears silk in this life&#8230;&#8221;<br \/>\nAbu `Ubeidah bin al-Jarrah wrote to `Umar so he wrote him back: &#8220;The Prophet (SAWS) said: Allah and his prophet are the Mawla of the one who has no Mawla&#8230;&#8221;<br \/>\nIt was reported that `Umar gathered all narrations on al-Sadaqat in a book, Nafi` narrated it from Ibn `Umar several times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>43-`Amro bin Hazm al-Ansari (raa)\u00a0<em>(died after 50.AH)<\/em>:\u00a0<\/strong>The Prophet (SAWS) appointed him on Najran and wrote him a book containing the rulings of purity and prayer and war booty and charity and other books&#8230; `Ata&#8217; bin abi Rabah read from this book in a very late time.<br \/>\nHe also collected some letters from the Prophet (SAWS) in the form of a book, and his son narrated it from him, it was later printed with the book of Ibn Touloun &#8220;I`lam al-Sa&#8217;ileen `an Kutub Sayyid al-Mursaleen&#8221;.<br \/>\nIbn `Abbas also had collected some letters from the prophet (SAWS) and the replies to these letters.<br \/>\n`Urwah also tried to collect the letters of the prophet (SAWS) and we find some of them mentioned in the book &#8220;al-Amwal&#8221;
