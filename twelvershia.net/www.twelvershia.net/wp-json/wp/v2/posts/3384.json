The same is said when comparing abu Hurayrah to Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthm\u0101n and other early Muhajireen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His statement, that `Al\u012b memorized one hundred thousand narrations, needs to be proven through reliable transmitters, otherwise, it is worthless.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, abu Hurayrah is not alone in having narrated a lot. Many of the younger Companions such as ibn `Abb\u0101s, ibn `Umar, ibn `Amr, abu Sa`\u012bd, J\u0101bir, `A\u2019ishah, Anas and others narrated plenty and had dedicated their time to teaching.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Hurayrah narrated a lot due to several reasons, such as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a- He always stuck by the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him) side, since he accompanied him for four years. He himself said: \u201cPeople say: Abu Hurayrah narrates much. Know that if it weren\u2019t for two verses I would not have narrated at all: {Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed,} until {I am the Relenting, the Merciful.} Our brothers from the Muh\u0101jireen were busy working in the markets, while the An\u1e63\u0101r were busy with trade. However, aba Hurayrah was always alongside the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), hoping to be fed. I\u2019ve witnessed what you have not and I\u2019ve heard what you have not.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">b- The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked Allah to strengthen his memory. Abu Hurayrah narrated: I said: \u201cO\u2019 Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), I hear a lot from you but I keep forgetting.\u201d He said: \u201cExtend your cloak.\u201d I extended it. He grabbed it with his hand, then told me: \u201cEmbrace it.\u201d Since I did this I haven\u2019t forgotten a thing.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">c- Abu Hurayrah had dedicated his time for teaching.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">d- He had a lot of students, almost eight-hundred in total.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">e- He died much later than others, in the year 57 or 58 Hijri.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, his narrations can be split into these categories:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a- Weak narrations incorrectly attributed to abu Hurayrah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">b- Repetitions, which is often the case.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">c- What he narrates from senior Companions, such as the ten and the Mothers of Believers, but he wouldn\u2019t mention their names as he trusts them, and this is known as Mursal al-\u1e62a\u1e25ab\u012b.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">d- His own words and sayings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim have agreed on 326 narrations from abu Hurayrah only. Bukh\u0101r\u012b narrated 93 from him exclusively, while Muslim narrated 98 from him exclusively. I add, most prophetic narrations reported by abu Hurayrah are not solely transmitted by him, but was backed by other Companions who also narrated them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What proves his great memorization is what al-\u1e24\u0101kim wrote, that Marw\u0101n summoned abu Hurayrah and began asking him while a man, who hid in the room, would write down everything. When a year passed, he summoned him again and asked him about the same matters that were documented in the book, so abu Hurayrah repeated it all without additions or subtractions.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Testimonies of the people of knowledge concerning abu Hurayrah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Sh\u0101fi`\u012b said: Abu Hurayrah was the best at memorizing narrations in his time.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 Dhakw\u0101n said: Abu Hurayrah was the best of the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him) Companions in memorizing.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Dhahab\u012b said: An Imam, a Faq\u012bh, a Mujtahid, a \u1e24afith, a companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and master of the \u1e24uf\u0101th.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>3- Tijani says on pg.62 [The Shia are the Real Ahlul-Sunnah \/ &#8220;Ahlul-Sunnah&#8221; and the Obliteration of the Sunnah]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>By all this, the narration of two weighty things becomes mass transmitted: \u201cI have left with you two weighty things, Allah\u2019s Book and my progeny etc\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in the footnotes: <strong>Reported Muslim and Tirmidh\u012b.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This is a lie, the narration of al-Thaqalayn is not mass transmitter, nor did Muslim report this version of it.
