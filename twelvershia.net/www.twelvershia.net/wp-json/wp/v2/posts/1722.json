The article was published on the 8th of June, 2012, and can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/ahlubait.wordpress.com\/2012\/06\/08\/dajjal-will-be-followed-by-lovers-of-uthman\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA translated the narration as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">When Dajjal would come out, he would be followed by lovers of Uthman, and if they had died before that, they would bring faith in dajjal in their graves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn response, we say that there are issues with the narration in both the chain and the text.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, this is not a hadith from the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), but a statement by Hudhaifa. With this in mind, one cannot accept such a statement as binding upon us. Secondly, we find in an authentic narration that Hudhaifa was not sure whether the assassination of Uthman would lead to good or evil. This very fact contradicts the statement above that has been attributed to him. He said (Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahaba 1\/603):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nO\u2019 Allah you know that I am free from the blood of `Uthman\u2026 The Arabs will know that if they were correct in killing him, they will receive milk (as reward), but if they were wrong then there will be blood (as punishment).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, we all know what happened after the death of `Uthman.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also it contradicts what is authentic from the Prophet (saw) in Musnad Ahmad 2\/344, 5\/35:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>On that day of Fitnah, `Uthman and his companions will be the truthful ones.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the chain, we find two flaws. The first is that it comes from the narration of Al-A\u2019amash who is a known Mudallis, and he did not state that he heard this narration from his Shaykh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe second flaw in the chain is that Mansour bin Abi Al-Aswad is a major shi\u2019ee narrator according to Yahya bin Ma\u2019een. Not only that, but he is not of a high level of tawtheeq, and the praise from scholars are mediocre praises. The least of which is the statement of Abu Hatim, \u201cHis hadith can be written.\u201d He implies that it is only used for supporting narrations. See his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWith the above in mind, it is safe to say that the above cannot be attributed to Hudhaifa, especially since we have knowledge that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) has praised `Uthman in numerous hadiths. See chapters of his merits in the Saheehain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to the article translated by SlaveOfAhlubait, which he entitled: Dajjal will be followed by Lovers of Uthman.
