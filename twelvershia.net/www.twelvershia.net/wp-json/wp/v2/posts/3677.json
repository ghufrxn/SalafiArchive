Unlike most of our refutations, this article refutes an accusation made by a Sunni, Dr. Jonathan Brown, may Allah guide him, for his statement has started making its rounds in Shia circles, and thus, a response is necessary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He states on p. 22:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMu\u2019awiyah himself encouraged his followers to forge Hadiths detracting from the standing of his opponents, the Shiah supporters of Ali and his descendants.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He references Ahmad bin Sa\u2019d Al-Din Al-Miswari\u2019s \u201cAl-Risala Al-Munqitha,\u201d who allegedly quotes from Al-Mada\u2019ini\u2019s \u201cAl-Ahdaath.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Attribution to Al-Mada\u2019ini<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first issue is the attribution of the narration to Al-Mada\u2019ini. Al-Miswari, who is an extreme Shi\u2019ee, quotes this narration, then mentions Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed\u2019s quoting of a narration by Niftawayh. Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed, who passes away in the seventh century, does not even hold the view that Mu\u2019awiyah is a Muslim, and states that he is accused of <em>zandaqa.<\/em> Refer to his commentary on the 25<sup>th<\/sup> speech for a demonstration of his hatred for Mu\u2019awiyah and accuses his mother of debauchery.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It should also be noted that we are not aware of any book by Al-Mada\u2019ini called \u201cAl-Ahdaath\u201d. The lengthiest lists of his works have been compiled by Ibn Al-Nadeem, in his Fihrist, and Yaqut Al-Hamawi, in his Mu\u2019jam, and neither contain a book named \u201cAl-Ahdaath.\u201d We do find the names of books that fall under the category of \u201cAl-Ahdaath\u201d, yes, but there is a difference between a category and the title of a book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, even if we accepted that Al-Mada\u2019ini did write this, we cannot accept the reliability of the report since Al-Mada\u2019ini, who passed away in the third century (225 AH), does not include a chain of transmission.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Edit: Updated on 07:30 AM (GMT) &#8211; 28\/1\/2017<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Brown has published some posts in where he has clarified his position in regards to the narration. As we can see below, he does not endorse the narration of Al-Mada&#8217;ini.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG-20170128-WA0001.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3694 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG-20170128-WA0001-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG-20170128-WA0002.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3695 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG-20170128-WA0002-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/h1>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>On Jonathan Brown\u2019s Accusation against Mu\u2019awiyah The following is a brief response to Jonathan Brown\u2019s accusations against Mu\u2019awiyah from his \u201cMisquoting Muhammad\u201d.
