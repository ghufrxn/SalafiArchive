The previous Imams were not ordered to make Da`wah(preaching) but rather there were benefits from attending the gatherings of the enemies, and mixing with them, this is why they announced the impermissibility of unsheathing the sword and the impermissibility of calling to their right of leadership, so that the enemies may not interfere with their presence among the people. They (Imams) have pointed to the appearance of an awaited one at the end of times, an Imam just like them, through which Allah lifts the darkness and revives the Sunnah and guides the nation, he is incapable of Taqiyyah in his appearance.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He repeats the same words again in volume 4 of this book, so notice the dangerous idea that he is declaring here, that previous Imams were ordered to stick to Taqiyyah and not declare their leadership or rise with the sword.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here we ask the following question, isn&#8217;t it the popular Shi`ee belief that Imam al-Husayn led a religious revolution to reform? That he took a heroic stance which SAVED the religion and he stood against the tyrant Sultan? The Shia even commemorate this event and describe it as &#8220;The Husayni revolution&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, we find that al-Mufid above turned the tables, he made it seem like his revolution with the sword is nothing but an act of disobedience since he was ordered to stick to Taqiyyah just like the rest of the Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also observe that what al-Mufid is basically saying, is that previous Imams were present because they were allowed to make Taqiyyah, whereas the 12th one is not present because he is prohibited from doing Taqiyyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is an issue&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taqiyyah in the tongue of the Arabs means to fear or to be cautious or wary of something, in order to protect oneself from it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We ask, isn&#8217;t the 12th Imam hiding out of caution and fear from his enemies, because if they discovered his true intentions they would harm him? Isn&#8217;t this LITERALLY Taqiyyah!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what we find is that even the 12th Imam is doing Taqiyyah, heck his Taqiyyah is much more than the Taqiyyah of his fathers before him! At least they would show their faces in public.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be informed dear reader that this contradicts al-Mufid&#8217;s words, when he claimed that the 12th Imam is prohibited from doing Taqiyyah unlike his fathers when he appears, yet we see that he already appeared since 1,250 years ago and has been doing Taqiyyah since.
