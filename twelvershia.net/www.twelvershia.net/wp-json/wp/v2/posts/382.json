Thus, the case was not resolved which attracted the ire of Aboo-Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah who then decided to kill Umar Ibn Al-Khattab.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all know that this excuse is not valid to kill any Muslim. Secondly, Abu Luluah was a slave, and he was not an employee of Mughira. If he indeed had grievances, it should have been against Mughira and not `Umar. Why did he kill `Umar instead of Mughira? The reason is obvious. He wanted to destroy Islam and the Muslims. He had no respect of the mosque in which he carried out this heinous act of killing the rightful caliph of the Muslims, along with killing and injuring other Muslims in the mosque while they were praying. How can there be any sympathy for such a person!? Only the Rafidha have the guts to show love and affection to this person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What the readers must know, is that the hatred of the Shia towards `Umar (ra) always leads them to be blinded, and to go out of their way to accuse him of anything.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then goes on to defend the Safavid rule with the following lame words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">As Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah was Persian, Nawasib propagandists have argued that the Shi&#8217;ee are the descendants of Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah as this was the faith ascribed to be the Safavids that propagated Shi&#8217;ism through their dominion. Their success in spreading the teachings of the Ahlulbayt (a.s) resulted in many Zoroastrians reverting to the path of the Ahlulbayt (a.s).<\/span><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is one of the most ridiculous defences of the Safavids by any of their lovers. The historical fact is that the Safavids massacred the ahlus sunnah and tortured them and exiled them to spread Shi&#8217;ism in Iran, not as RTS would have its readers believe. The Safavid era is filled with the brutal use of force against the Ahlus Sunnah and the state sponsorship of the Shia religion in order to separate Iran from the Muslim world. The Safavid era was the kind of government you would expect if an extremist Shia scholar like Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi becomes the ruler. Hamid Algar,\u00a0Ph.D. (University of Cambridge, 1965),\u00a0Professor of Persian and Islamic Studies.\u00a0Near Eastern Studies and Persian Literature. He\u00a0says in &#8216;Encyclopedia Iranica&#8217;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It was, however, nothing less than a reign of terror that inaugurated the new dispensation. On capturing Tabriz in 907\/1501, a city two-thirds Sunnite in population, Shah Esm\u0101\u02bfil threatened with death all who might resist the adoption of Shi\u02bfite prayer ritual in the main congregational mosque, and he had Qezelb\u0101\u0161 soldiers patrol the congregation to ensure that none raise his voice against the cursing of the first three caliphs, viewed as enemies of the Prophet\u2019s family. In Tabriz and elsewhere, gangs of professional execrators known as the tabarr\u0101\u02bei\u0101n would accost the townsfolk at random, forcing them to curse the objectionable personages on pain of death. Selective killings of prominent Sunnites occurred in a large number of places, notably Qazvin and Isfahan, and in Shiraz and Yazd, outright massacres took place. Sunnite mosques were desecrated, and the tombs of eminent Sunnite scholars destroyed (Aubin, 1970, pp. 237-38; idem, 1988, pp. 94-101).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So we can easily conclude that the Safavid didn&#8217;t succeed in spreading the real teachings of Ahlul-Bayt as found in the books of Ahlul-Sunnah. Instead, they spread the fake teachings of Ahlul-Bayt from the books of the Shia, teachings such as: All non-Shia are sons of adultery, the non-Shia are as filthy as Jews and Christians, and teachings that talk about the desecration of the graves of the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his wives after the appearance of their 12th Imam who shall revive them and torture them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We seek refuge in Allah from these teachings!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS&#8217;s next goal is to prove that abu Luluah is a Muslim, he quotes the following narrations:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Aboo Abid Qatn Ibn Nasir Al-Ghabry narrated from Jaffar Ibn Suleiman narrated from Thabit Al-Benanai narrating Abi Rafi\u2019 who said, &#8220;Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah was a slave for Mughira ibn Shu&#8217;ba and he used to make millstones and Mughira used to exploit him [his working power] everyday for four dirhams. Then Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah met Umar ibn Al-Khattab and addressed him; &#8216;O commander of the faithful, Mughira made heavier the burden of my livelihood so ask him to ease me.&#8217; Therefore Umar told him; &#8216;Fear God and do good to your master,&#8217; with Umar having in his will to meet Mughira and talk to him so that he eases (Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah case). The slave therefore got angry and said, &#8216;Your righteousness contained all other people [but not me]!&#8217; Therefore he made up his mind to kill him and he made a dagger with two heads and poisoned it and came to Al-Hormuzan (Persian King) and said, &#8216;How do you see this?&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;You do not hit anyone by it but you kill him.&#8217; Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah awaited for Umar and he came at the fajr prayer (morning prayers)until he stood behind Umar. And whenever the prayer was established, Umar used to speak and say; &#8216;Establish your rows&#8217; and he said what he used [always] to say and when he said takbeer, Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah hit him in his shoulder and hit him in his side, then Umar fell down and he hit by his dagger thirteen men. Among them seven died and six survived and Umar was carried and taken to his house and people shouted until the sun was about to rise. Then Abdul-rahman ibn Awf said, &#8216;O people! The prayer! The prayer!&#8217; He said [Abi Rafi\u2019]; And they [people] rushed to the prayer, then Abdul-Rahman ibn Awf took the lead and prayed, leading them, with the shortest two Surahs of the Qur&#8217;aan. And when he accomplished his prayer they headed to Umar, and he called for a drink to know the intensity of his wound, so wine was brought, and he drank it and it came out of his wound and he did not know whether it was wine or blood. Then he called for yoghurt, and he drank it and it came out of his wound, then they said; &#8216;O commander of the faithful, there is no harm [to you]!&#8217; He said; &#8216;If being killed had a harm aspect, then I am killed.&#8221; Then people started to say compliments for him. They said; &#8216;O commander of the faithful, may Allah reward you. The good, you were&#8230;&#8217; [many things]. Then they left, and other people came in and said compliments for him, then Umar said; &#8216;I swear to God, instead of what you are saying, I would have preferred that I departed this world as a poor man, with nothing on my burden and nothing for my [property] and the companionship of the Messenger of Allah (saw) has been saved for me.&#8217;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the reader can see, abu Luluah is a really evil man, he got about 12$ daily and didn&#8217;t like his working hours, so he went and plotted with his companion, the Persian king al-Hormuzan, and he\u00a0assassinated\u00a0the leader of the Muslims during prayer with a poisoned two headed dagger, then he stabbed random Muslims in the mosque with the dagger killing seven of them. Even though the calamity was great, yet the Muslims continued their prayer quickly so as to not miss the obligatory duty.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then RTS quotes another similar narration:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Ahmad Ibn Alee b. Al-Muthanna narrated, Qutun Ibn Nasir Al-Ghabry narrated from Jaffar son of Suleiman Al-Deb\u2019y narrated to us Thabit Al-Nanany narrating from Abi Rafi\u2019 who said; Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah was a slave for Mughira ibn Shu&#8217;ba and he used to make millstones and Al-Mughira used to to manipulate his labour by giving him four dirhams every day. Then Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah met Umar ibn Al-Khattab (to complain about his exhaustion) and addressed him; &#8216;O commander of the faithful, Al-Mughira made heavier the burden of my livelihood so ask him to ease me.&#8221; Therefore Umar told him; &#8216;Fear God and do good to your master.&#8217; Therefore the slave got angry and said; &#8216;Your righteousness contained all other people [but not me!]&#8217; Therefore he made up his mind to kill him. He made a dagger with two heads and poisoned it and came to Al-Hormuzan (Persian King) and said; &#8216;How do you see this?&#8217; Then he said; &#8216;You do not hit anyone by it but you kill him!&#8217; He said [Abi Rafi\u2019]; and Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah awaited for Umar, therefore he came to him at the fajr (morning prayers) until he stood behind him.

And when he accomplished his prayer, they headed to Umar and he called for a drink to know the intensity of his wound. So wine was brought and he drank it, and it came out of his wound, and he did not know if it was wine or blood. Then he called for yoghurt, and he drank it and it came out of his wound then they said; &#8216;O commander of the faithful, there is no harm [to you]!&#8217; He said; &#8216;If being killed is a harm then I am killed.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And another similar one:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">From Aboo Rafi, who said; Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah was a slave of Mughira ibn Shu&#8217;ba. He used to manipulate his labour by giving him four dirhams every day. One day Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah met Umar and he said to him, &#8220;O commander of the faithful! Surely, Mughira has made me tired of his cheating labour on me. Kindly speak to him so that he might make it easy for me.&#8217; Umar said to him, &#8220;Fear Allah and continue to do good to your master (Al-Mughira&#8217;).&#8221; Umar had an intention of speaking to Mughira on this matter so that he might ease some labour to his slave (Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah). But the slave became angry and said, &#8216;All people are benefited from his justice except me!&#8217; And then he intended to kill him, and so he made a knife which had two splitting ends and sharpened it and poisoned it. And he (Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah) went to Hormuzan (king of Persia) saying, &#8216;How did you see this knife?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I see that you will never stab with it any one except you will kill him!&#8217; He then said, Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah\u00a0\u00a0prepared for his action and he came at the Fajr (morning prayer) until he stood behind Umar. When prayer commended, Umar used to say, &#8216;Establish your lines,&#8217; and when he did his takbeer, Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah stabbed him on his chest and hit his side. Umar fell down. Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah hit his Dagger thirteen times. In the process seven men died and six got injured. Then he ran to his house, and people stayed till the sun had almost risen. Abdul-Rahman ibn Awf took the lead and prayed leading them with the shortest two Surahs of the Qur&#8217;aan. And when he accomplished his prayer, they headed to Umar and he called for a drink to know the intensity of his wound, so wine was brought and he drank it and it came out of his wound and he did not know if it was wine or blood. Then he called for yoghurt, and he drank it, and it came out of his wound. Then they said, &#8216;O commander of the faithful, there is no harm [to you]!&#8217; He said, &#8216;If being killed is a harm then I am killed.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And another:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Aboo Rafi&#8217; said that Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah was a servant of Mughira Ibn Shu&#8217;ba and he used to make millstones. He said (narrator), Mughira used to exploit him every day for four dirhams. He said then Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah met Umar, so he said, &#8216;O commander of the faithful, Mughira has burdened me, so speak to him so that he can ease me!&#8217; Umar said: &#8216;Fear Allah and enjoin goodness to your Master.&#8217; He said: From the intention of Umar is to meet Mughira and speak to him about taking it easy [about Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah]. So he said: Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah became angry and said: &#8216;His justice is vast enough to fill in everyone except me!&#8217; So he became angry and pre-planned to murder him [Umar]. He [narrator] said: So he constructed a dagger with two heads. He said: He unsheathed it and Umar prepared himself and Umar used to not make Takbeer if the prayers were established until he says, &#8220;establish your rows.&#8221; He said: So he [Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah] stood on the first row with his shoes while Umar was in front of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And another:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated Amr bin Maimun: I saw Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Madinah. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &#8220;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &#8220;Stand in straight lines.&#8221; When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak`a so that the people may have the time to join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself. Umar held the hand of Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer. Those who were standing by the side of Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al-Mughira.&#8221; On that Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Madinah.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn Abbas said to `Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221; Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221; When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;O Abdullah bin Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. Umar said, &#8220;If the property of Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani Adi bin Ka`b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221; Umar then said (to Abdullah), &#8220;Go to A&#8217;isha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet (saw) and Aboo Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted A&#8217;isha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to `Umar), &#8220;Abdullah bin Umar has come.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and Umar asked (Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet A&#8217;isha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet (saw), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the graveyard of the Muslims.&#8221; Then Hafsa came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then Umar mentioned Alee, Uthman, Az-Zubair, Talha, Sa`d and Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the ruler, it will be alright: Otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Madinah before the emigrants and belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. Abdullah bin Umar greeted (A&#8217;isha) and said, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; A&#8217;isha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. When he was buried, the group (recommended by Umar) held a meeting. Then Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Alee.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to Uthman.&#8221; Sa`d said, &#8216;I give up my right to Abdur-Rahman bin Auf.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman then said (to Uthman and Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. Uthman and Alee) kept silent. Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. Alee) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (saw) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When `Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then Alee gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Madinah) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reply to the above narrations is as follows..<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have time, you can spend it on reading these narrations.

Just because a person claims to be a Muslim, doesn&#8217;t mean that he becomes a Muslim, and we know very well that a Muslim never attacks 30 Muslims in a mosque, and if he is still a Muslim, than the people attacking the mosques nowadays must be considered Muslims by the Shia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Luluah didn&#8217;t just attack `Umar, who had done no harm to the Majoosi, he attacked 30 other Muslims, and seven of whom died, and that too in the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Even the accursed one, Ibn Muljim didn&#8217;t attack `Ali in prayers, nor killed other Muslims randomly after attacking him. When a Khariji doesn&#8217;t attack the Caliph in the masjid, how come a Muslim attack the Caliph in the masjid? Ibn Muljim didn&#8217;t commit suicide but Abu Luluah committed suicide, for he didn&#8217;t care a bit about what Islam says regarding suicide. If the Shia want to conjecture from one &#8216;ambiguous&#8217; evidence, which is just ridiculous, the Sunnis have many valid reasons to believe that he was not a Muslim, and the words of `Umar when he became happy after coming to know about his killer that the one who killed him was not a Muslim is more than enough that even he didn&#8217;t consider Abu Luluah to be a Muslim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add that the Prophet (peace be upon him) didn&#8217;t even allow people to cut the trees of Madinah, let alone kill another Muslim, in his own mosque!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet (peace be upon him) described it as a \u201cSacred Precinct\u201d in many of the Prophetical Hadith. One of them was narrated by Imam Muslim that the Messenger of Allah(PBUH)said: &#8220;Abraham sanctified Mecca and made it a sacred precinct, and I have sanctified Al Madinah as a sacred precinct between its two mountains, and that no blood may be shed therein and no weapon to be carried therein for combating, and no trees but to be cut but for feeding.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even `Amr bin Maymun who narrated that last big narration said that he&#8217;s an infidel:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&#8220;A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>\u00a0Twelver\u00a0Shia versus Imam `Ali (ra):<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The literal meaning of &#8216;Ijtihad&#8217; is to strive with one\u2019s total ability and efforts to reach a goal in order to deduce certain rulings from Qur&#8217;aan and Hadeeth.

One can&#8217;t simply conjure a ruling from thin air or they would be opposing the very foundations of it. Despite these very principals the so called &#8216;Ahl Sunnah&#8217; believe all those who cursed, fought and even murdered Imam Alee (a.s) had been practicing Tawil and Ijithad and thus will receive a reward from Allah (swt) for their efforts.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Killer of `Umar (ra) versus killer of `Ali (ra), and the facts:<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS then says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Al Haythami gives a different rule for the companions as he does with the Khawarijes even though he admits they are enemies of Imam Alee (a.s).\u00a0\u00a0In reality the actions of the Kharjies and the Sahahbah are of one and the same. Both parties fought the rightly guided Khalifah of the time and committed numerous atrocities. Ibn Hazim implies the companions intentions were sincere, and they only wished to uphold the laws of Allah (swt) and the Sunnah of His Messenger (saw).

The option of Tawil and Ijtihad are available to those who killed Imam \u2018Alee (a.s) and fought against him. Yet Qu&#8217;raan and Hadeeth has declared such people in violation of Islam . Ibn Taymiyyah declared the murderer of Imam Alee (a.s) as \u201cOne of the best of mankind in worship, and one of the people of knowledge&#8221; based on what exactly?. How would any knowledgeable person not know Imam Alee (a.s) relationship to the Prophet Muhammad (saw)?.

Ubaidullah took his sword, and rushed out of his house to take revenge. He first went to the house of Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah, and killed his daughter. Later He sought to murder of Jafina (a Christian who had been brought to Madina after the conquest of Iraq), and last but not least Hurmuzan ( a Persian General who had been captured during the Persian conquest). When the Muslims came to know about what had happened, Ubaidullah ibn Umar was apprehended. With the acceptation of Abdur Rahman ibn Aboo Bakr no other person supported the theory of any conspiracy. Adequate evidence was thus not forthcoming to support the theory of the involvement of Jafina, Hurmuzan and the daughter of Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah in any alleged conspiracy. Even if it was established that these persons had entered into a conspiracy, there was no grounds for justification for the killing of these personalities. Ubaidullah ibn Umar had no right or justification to take the law in his own hand and murder four persons without affording them an opportunity for defense. That was the Arab practice of the days of ignorance which was in violation of the injunctions of Islam. The case was tried by Uthman with the help of a jury which included Imam Alee (a.s), Amr b Al A&#8217;as (a staunch opponent of Imam Alee during the tribulation of Muawiyah) and some other prominent companions. Imam Alee (a.s) and other notable companions were of the opinion that the dictates of justice demanded that Ubaidullah ibn Umar should be executed for taking the law in his hand, and murdering the citizens without cause. Imam Alee (a.s) was emphatically of the view that in Islam, law was no respecter of persons, and Ubaidullah Ibn Umar could not be saved from the penalty of law merely on the ground that he was the son of the late tyrant.

A man from the Jews, whose name was Mirdas ibn Naheek al fadaki gathered his family menmbers and his belongings and went to a hill, and said : I testify that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.

Umar Ibn Al-Khattab would inspect the rows so as to ensure that no gaps existed between worshippers, and would only then lead the congregation in prayer. With this in mind, was the presence of a Zoroastrian not a gap for Umar and the Companions? Wouldn&#8217;t anyone consider the presence of a Zoroastrian man in the ranks of worshippers as a defect in the congregational prayer? What is yet more perplexing is that Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah, a Zoroastrian came and stood within the ranks of the worshippers wearing his shoes whilst praying the dawn prayer. Would this not have attracted the ire of anyone? Or was it Sunnah for non Muslims to come inside the mosque wearing shoes? How was Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah able to place himself in the first line of prayers and read directly behind Umar without being challenged for it? Some may say that Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah entered the masjid in a clandestine manner, however, this would only be achieved had he entered with his face covered thus ensuring he was not recognisable. This however is completely implausible, any individual covering his face making his way towards the head of state would most likely arouse suspicion. Such a person would be challenged, searched or even arrested for the possibility of having been in possession of an offensive weapon.

Hence this should not be a problem and just because Abu Luluah was praying with his shoes on, we can&#8217;t automatically come to the conclusion that he was a Kafir, so how can the Muslims present at that time have any problem with it? Fourthly, Umar would look at the feet of the people, and he would not look at the faces of the people praying behind him since he wanted ony to straighten the rows of the people just like the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to do. There are lots of other possibilities which I don&#8217;t care to mention because everyone can realize that was not difficult at all during that time, and what I have mentioned is already sufficient.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Was Abu Luluah a Christian or a Zaroastrian?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are two narrations which RTS has posted on its website regarding whether Abu Luluah was a\u00a0 Christian or Zaroastrian.<\/p>\n<p>Abd al-Barr: narrated from Khalf Bin Qasim told us Hassan bin Rasheeq told Dolaabi told Muhammad ibn Hameed told us Alee bin Mujahid who said, &#8220;We had difference in regards to the personality of Aboo Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;ah, some claimed: He was a Majoosi (Zoroastrian).
