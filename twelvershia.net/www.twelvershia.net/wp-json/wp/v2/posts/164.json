The companions are not infallible and are susceptible to sinning and disobeying Allah. So, arguing that one needs to follow the companions of the Prophet (pbuh) in <b>ALL<\/b> of their actions is equal to saying that one should attempt to sin; and since all actions of the companions is a form of guidance, then disobeying Allah is a praiseworthy action. Of course, there is no scholar that is from Ahl Al-Sunnah that believes in such, so attributing this view to Ahl Al-Sunnah is incorrect.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS quotes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&#8220;\u2026And I dissociate myself to you from what these people (meaning the Muslims) are doing.

And Baraa&#8217;, the son of Malik, the brother of Anas, the son of Malik, and he was Baraa&#8217; &#8211; as what is said &#8211; stood, and when he attended the war, he began trembling until the men sat on him, and then he would urinate in his trousers. And when he would urinate, he would be like a lion. And when he saw what the Muslims did of the exposure, and what he saw from the people of Yamama, he would take what he took until the men sat on him. And when he urinated, he sprinted and said: &#8216;To where, O Muslims? I am Baraa&#8217;, the son of Malik!
