Originally,\u00a0 the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 man\u00a0 was\u00a0 a\u00a0 point\u00a0 of\u00a0 consensus amongst\u00a0 historians;\u00a0 however,\u00a0 it\u00a0 was\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 18th century\u00a0 when Orientalists\u00a0 noticed\u00a0 a\u00a0 peculiar\u00a0 pattern\u00a0 regarding\u00a0 his\u00a0 reports which caused a break in the consensus. These narrations came from\u00a0 a\u00a0 single\u00a0 source,\u00a0 namely,\u00a0 Sayf\u00a0 bin\u00a0 Omar\u00a0 Al-Tameemi,\u00a0 a historian that is regarded as weak in the eyes of the scholars of Hadith. This discovery led to the publishing of articles and then books on the subject, which ultimately led Shias, like Murtadha Al-`Askari\u00a0 to adopt the view that Ibn Saba\u2019 was a figment of\u00a0 AlTameemi\u2019s imagination. Not\u00a0 too\u00a0 long\u00a0 after\u00a0 this\u00a0 view\u00a0 spread\u00a0 within\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 circles\u00a0 did\u00a0 we find\u00a0 Sunni\u00a0 scholars\u00a0 like\u00a0 Sulaiman\u00a0 Al-`Awdah\u00a0 responding\u00a0 by simply\u00a0 providing\u00a0 alternative\u00a0 sources,\u00a0 in\u00a0 both\u00a0 Sunni\u00a0 and\u00a0 Shias books, which prove\u00a0 the existence of Ibn Saba. The\u00a0 irrefutable proofs\u00a0 provided by these Sunnis caused the spawning of a new book\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 matter.\u00a0 This\u00a0 new\u00a0 study\u00a0 \u201cAbdullah\u00a0 ibn\u00a0 Saba: Dirasah wa Tahleel\u201d by the Shia scholar\u00a0 Ali\u00a0 Aal-Muhsin\u00a0 spread amongst the\u00a0 Shi`ee youth.\u00a0 His arguments\u00a0 were\u00a0 then translated into\u00a0 English\u00a0 in\u00a0 a\u00a0 book\u00a0 called\u00a0 \u201cAbd\u00a0 Allah\u00a0 ibn\u00a0 Saba:\u00a0 Myth Exploded,\u201d\u00a0 by\u00a0 Shi\u2019ee\u00a0 apologist\u00a0 Toyib\u00a0 Olawuyi,\u00a0 the\u00a0 book\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ali Aal-Muhsin\u00a0 provides\u00a0 a\u00a0 new\u00a0 outlook\u00a0 on\u00a0 how\u00a0 the\u00a0 narrations about Abdullah ibn Saba should be consumed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As\u00a0 for\u00a0 Olawuyi,\u00a0 he\u00a0 not\u00a0 only\u00a0 argues\u00a0 that\u00a0 Sunnis\u00a0 have\u00a0 no\u00a0 place accepting\u00a0 the\u00a0 ideologies\u00a0 attributed\u00a0 to\u00a0 Ibn\u00a0 Saba,\u00a0 but\u00a0 suggests that his very existence is questionable,\u00a0 due to the weakness of the chains.

The author\u00a0 jumps into arguing\u00a0 that Sunnis make twelve claims regarding Ibn Saba. He lists them as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. He was a descendant of Saba\u2019, and belonged to one of the Saba\u2019ee tribes.<br \/>\n2. He was a black Arab with a black slave mother.<br \/>\n3. He was a Jew from Sanain Yemen.<br \/>\n4.\u00a0 He\u00a0 accepted\u00a0 Islam\u00a0 during\u00a0 the\u00a0 khilafah\u00a0 of Uthman b. Affan.<br \/>\n5.\u00a0 He\u00a0 stirred\u00a0 up\u00a0 the\u00a0 public,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 the Egyptians, against\u00a0 Uthman\u00a0 and caused the latter\u2019s bloody overthrow.<br \/>\n6. He was the first to claim that Ali, alaihi al-salam, was the designated successor of the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu alaihi wa Alihi.<br \/>\n7. He was the first to proclaim belief in Al-Raja`ah\u2013\u00a0 that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 the\u00a0 return\u00a0 to\u00a0 this\u00a0 world\u00a0 after\u00a0 death\u00a0 by certain dead people.<br \/>\n8. He was the first to publicly criticize or revile Abu Bakr and `Umar.<br \/>\n9. He was popularly called Ibn Al-Sawda\u2019\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 son of the black mother.<br \/>\n10. Imam\u00a0 Ali\u00a0 was frustrated with him, and abused him by calling him \u201cthe black container\u201d and also banished him to Al-Madain.<br \/>\n11.\u00a0 Amir\u00a0 Al-Muminin\u00a0 `Ali\u00a0 b.\u00a0 Abi\u00a0 Talib\u00a0 saw\u00a0 it\u00a0 as legitimate\u00a0 to\u00a0 execute\u00a0 him\u00a0 for\u00a0 reviling\u00a0 Abu\u00a0 Bakr and\u00a0 `Umar,\u00a0 and\u00a0 would\u00a0 have\u00a0 done\u00a0 so\u00a0 had\u00a0 people not talked him out of the decision.<br \/>\n12. `Ali\u00a0 burnt him (i.e. Ibn Saba\u2019) and his followers alive for calling him (i.e. `Ali) Allah.<\/p>\n<p>The author is more or less correct, that Ahl Al-Sunnah do usually make statements like these. The author goes on to claim that all the\u00a0 statements\u00a0 above\u00a0 lack\u00a0 proper\u00a0 proof\u00a0 since\u00a0 the\u00a0 information above can only be found in narrations with weak chains.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before carrying on, it is important\u00a0 to explain why Ahl Al-Sunna make\u00a0 such\u00a0 claims\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 first\u00a0 place.\u00a0 The\u00a0 author\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 delve into that matter since, as explained previously, his book is not an\u00a0 introductory\u00a0 piece\u00a0 of\u00a0 text\u00a0 for\u00a0 this\u00a0 very\u00a0 subject.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Sunni objective\u00a0 is\u00a0 to\u00a0 simply\u00a0 taunt\u00a0 the\u00a0 Shias\u00a0 by\u00a0 suggesting\u00a0 that\u00a0 their beliefs\u00a0 have\u00a0 evolved\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 false\u00a0 ideologies\u00a0 that\u00a0 were incorrectly attributed to Ahl Al-Bayt. To\u00a0 make\u00a0 this\u00a0 clearer,\u00a0 we\u00a0 quote\u00a0 two\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 earliest\u00a0 and\u00a0 most reliable\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 historians\u00a0 &#8211;\u00a0 Al-Hasan\u00a0 bin\u00a0 Musa\u00a0 Al-Nawbakhti\u00a0 and Sa\u2019ad\u00a0 bin\u00a0 `Abdullah\u00a0 Al-Qummi. Together,\u00a0 they\u00a0 describe\u00a0 the formation of the Saba\u2019ee sect (the followers of Abdullah Ibn Saba\u2019): A\u00a0 group\u00a0 of\u00a0 scholars\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 companions\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ali (alaihi alsalam) said that\u00a0 Abdullah ibn Saba was a Jew,\u00a0 who\u00a0 converted\u00a0 to\u00a0 Islam,\u00a0 and\u00a0 befriended\u00a0 Ali (alaihi alsalam), and he used to say, as a Jew that Yusha\u2019 bin Noon is after Musa (alaihi alsalam) with this view, and so he said in Islam after the death of the Prophet (salallahu alaihi wa aalih) about Ali the same (belief). He was the first to say that it is mandatory that Ali\u00a0 (alaihi alsalam) was the Imam, and the first to disassociate from his enemies, and he\u00a0 made\u00a0 takfeer\u00a0 of\u00a0 them.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 light\u00a0 that those\u00a0 there\u00a0 were\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 Shias\u00a0 said:\u00a0 The origins of Rafdh are taken from Judaism. In other words, Sunnis do not feel obligated to establish every one of those twelve claims. It is sufficient for Ahl\u00a0 Al-Sunnah\u00a0 to simply establish the existence of the man,\u00a0 who wasn\u2019t from Ahl Al-Bayt,\u00a0 that\u00a0 had\u00a0 views\u00a0 that\u00a0 evolved\u00a0 into\u00a0 modern\u00a0 day\u00a0 Shiasm. Whether or not his mother was black\u00a0 or from Yemeni origins\u00a0 is irrelevant. To some extent,\u00a0 the Sunnis\u00a0 have already\u00a0 achieved their\u00a0 goals, and\u00a0 we\u00a0 find\u00a0 this\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 in\u00a0 Olawuyi\u2019s\u00a0 introduction,\u00a0 for\u00a0 Olawuyi accepts\u00a0 the\u00a0 authenticity\u00a0 of\u00a0 a\u00a0 few\u00a0 narrations\u00a0 that\u00a0 condemn Abdullah\u00a0 bin\u00a0 Saba\u00a0 which\u00a0 can\u00a0 be\u00a0 found\u00a0 in\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 books.\u00a0 These narrations clearly state that Abdullah ibn Saba saw Ali as a deity and that Ali\u00a0 burned him alive for it. Olawuyi refers\u00a0 to these narrations as authentic. Soon\u00a0 though,\u00a0 he\u00a0 criticizes\u00a0 Ibn\u00a0 Taymiyah\u00a0 for\u00a0 holding\u00a0 the\u00a0 same view.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, Olawuyi finds it acceptable for Shias to hold the view that Ibn Saba\u2019\u00a0 referred to\u00a0 Ali\u00a0 as a god, while believing\u00a0 that there is not enough binding evidence upon Sunnis to hold the same view about Ibn Saba\u2019, and that he should be nothing more than a myth in the eyes of Sunnis. Therefore,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to\u00a0 Olawuyi,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 incorrect\u00a0 for\u00a0 a\u00a0 Sunni\u00a0 to claim that\u00a0 \u201cthe origins\u00a0 of Rafdh\u00a0 are taken\u00a0 from Judaism.\u201d\u00a0 Yet, even if Sunnis were to stand\u00a0 down from such a claim, it would still\u00a0 be\u00a0 correct\u00a0 for\u00a0 them\u00a0 to\u00a0 claim\u00a0 that\u00a0 \u201cthe\u00a0 origins\u00a0 of\u00a0 Rafdh according\u00a0 to\u00a0 authentic\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 reports,\u00a0 which\u00a0 are\u00a0 binding\u00a0 upon Shias themselves, are taken from Judaism.\u201d Even though the last claim is true, it would be more satisfying to the reader to get the full picture, since the claim that Ibn Saba\u2019s views\u00a0 evolved\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 Twelver\u00a0 faith\u00a0 is\u00a0 not\u00a0 exclusive\u00a0 to authentic\u00a0 Shia\u00a0 reports,\u00a0 but\u00a0 is\u00a0 also\u00a0 the\u00a0 correct\u00a0 position\u00a0 in\u00a0 the eyes\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ahl\u00a0 Al-Sunnah.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 before\u00a0 even\u00a0 studying\u00a0 the reports,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 important\u00a0 to\u00a0 understand\u00a0 the\u00a0 Saba\u2019ee\u00a0 sect\u00a0 and establish its existence.Before carrying on, it is important for readers to be aware that our book, \u201cAbdullah ibn\u00a0 Saba:\u00a0 The man,\u00a0 his teachings, and\u00a0 his Influence\u00a0

however, the first two chapters may be consumed as a\u00a0 standalone\u00a0 work\u00a0 that\u00a0 establishes\u00a0 and\u00a0 discusses\u00a0 the\u00a0 most important matters that revolve around
