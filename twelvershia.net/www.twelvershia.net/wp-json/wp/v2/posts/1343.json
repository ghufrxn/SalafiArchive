It says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">abu huraira said that umar told me: o enemy of allah and islam, you did treachery in property of allah<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">we see in mustadarak, vol 3, page 191<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not surprising, both narrations are not quoted in full, since doing so would be problematic for these \u201cacademic.\u201d Both narrations finally end with Omar offering <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2015\/01\/11\/abu-huraira\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Abu Huraira<\/a> a position. Abu Huraira refuses to take the position.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The very narration suggests that Omar went back from his accusation, for it is not logical to hire a thief that you distrust.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a similar narration, from the path of Ayoub Al-Sakhtiyani from Ibn Sireen, we find that Omar finally returns Abu Huraira\u2019s money to him. See Musanaf Abd Al-Razzaq #20659 (the chain is saheeh). This supports what we have suggested earlier, which is that Omar has went back on his opinion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait, Hasan Molai, and Khair Talab\u2019s collaborative article, entitled: \u201cAbu Huraira: Enemy of Allah &amp; His Book, and a Thief.\u201d The article was published on Wilayat.net on the 11th of February, 2011, and can <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2014\/08\/21\/response-to-abu-huraira-enemy-of-allah\/\" title=\"Response to: Abu Huraira: Enemy of Allah\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3894,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":{"0":"post-1343","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-hadith"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1343","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1343"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1343\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1633,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1343\/revisions\/1633"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3894"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1343"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1343"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1343"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
