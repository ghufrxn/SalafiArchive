Due to their limitations in the physical world, it is only natural to seek spiritual guidance that would lead one to their significant other. Asking and requesting from Allah \u2013 subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala \u2013 is without a doubt the best way for one to achieve their goals. However, it is also in the name of religion, that some have decided to spread their poison, by teaching people to seek the assistance of devils through magic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/11\/10\/dua-for-marriage\/jami-fawaid-cover\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3505 external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3505 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/jami-fawaid-cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"jami-fawaid-cover\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/jami-fawaid-cover-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/jami-fawaid-cover-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/jami-fawaid-cover-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/jami-fawaid-cover-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>Recently, we have stumbled upon a book called Jami\u2019 Al-Fawa\u2019id fi Asrar Al-Maqasid by Habeeb bin Musa Al-Afshari Al-Najafi. The book was translated into Arabic from Farsi by Ali Al-Amini and was printed by Dar Al-Irshad. The contents of the book are relied upon by the most popular Shia website for duas, <a href=\"duas.org\">duas.org<\/a>. The website has an article on dua for marriage in which they had made use of a chapter in the aforementioned book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After seconds of scanning the contents of the book, we found shocking images. The book contains shocking incantations and instructions on how to perform magic instead of regular dua for marriage. The tragedy here is that this book is marketed off as a religious book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below, we have included images of these incantations as well along with the translation of the contents. However, we purposefully blurred out some of the images so that we could not be held accountable for spreading incantations.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shia Dua for Marriage<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/11\/10\/dua-for-marriage\/sihr1new\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3502 external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3502 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/sihr1new-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"dua for marriage\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/sihr1new-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/sihr1new-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/sihr1new-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/sihr1new-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>1- Whoever has a daughter that is under a spell that prevents marriage or <strong>a daughter who is of age and is not married yet.<\/strong> She is to write these symbols and numbers, then carry them.

However, books of supplications do often include such incantations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another example of this is Al-Majlisi, one of the top Shia hadith scholars of all time, author of Bihar Al-Anwar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will let the screenshots speak for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Ruling on Practicing Sorcery<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Qudama states in his Al-Mughni 2\/2181:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Magic includes) knots, incantation, and words that are uttered or written. It is made into the body of the bewitched, his heart, or his mind, in a non-physical manner. Magic is a reality that may lead to death, disease, cause a man to be unable to reach his wife, and it could cause separation between spouses. It can cause hate between two, and <strong>bring two together.<\/strong> These are the views of Al-Shafi\u2019ee.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He continues:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning and teaching magic is forbidden. We are not aware of a difference of opinion among scholars regarding this. Our companions have said: A mage becomes a disbeliever if he learns it or practices it, whether he deems it permissible or not.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is all supported by the words of Allah \u2013 subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala \u2013 in Surat Al-Baqara (verse 102):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAnd they followed what the Shaitans chanted of the sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, \u2018surely we are only a trial, therefore <strong>do not be a disbeliever<\/strong>.\u2019 Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might <strong>cause a separation between a man and his wife<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Real Dua for Marriage<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may come as a shock to readers that we do not have a narration of a dua from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 for the purpose of marriage. However, we have seen success with a very simple dua for marriage. It does not require memorizing or reading out of many lines of invocations. Neither does it require one to write down any charms or spray water on the doors of who one fancies either.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All one needs to do is say, \u201cO\u2019 Allah, provide me with a righteous wife\/husband.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>This is the dua for marriage. It is as simple as that.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another method is to ask others to ask Allah \u2013 subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala \u2013 to provide you with a wife\/husband.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two years ago, a friend of mine was hosting a lecture. After introducing the speaker, he told the audience that the organizers of the event were single. He then asked the audience to make a dua for marriage for the organizers. The organizers, a group of young men, were extremely embarrassed. The audience was confused, yet, they naturally obliged. In under a year and a half, all of the organizers were married, including the host himself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May Allah give preserve our youth and provide them with a righteous spouse.
