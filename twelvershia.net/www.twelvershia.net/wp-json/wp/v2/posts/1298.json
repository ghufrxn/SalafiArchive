And he said: all people on one side, and my companions on other. And he said: it is not must\/compulsory to do migration after victory of mecca. But there is reward for jihad and intention. Marwan negated this when he heard this narration. At that time, rafi\u2019I bin khadeej and zaid bin thabit were sitting there on throne of Marwan. Abu saeed said: if these two wish, they can narrate this narration to you but one of them fears that you will take away their leadership of tribe. And other is worried that you will stop his sadaqat\/monetary benefits. So both of them kept quiet. Marwan stood up taking a lash in his hand. On seeing this, both of them said: he is telling the truth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the narration is weak, it should first be noted how desperate SoA is in attempting to condemn the companions of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). One does not even have to study the hadith closely to notice that Rafi\u2019 and Zaid confirm the hadith and reject worldly pleasures when they see a fellow companion in danger. This not only demonstrates their loyalty towards one another, but their prioritizing of the hereafter over the dunya.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nHowever, it is best to point out the weakness in the hadith for the sake of clarity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWe\u2019d like to highlight one of the ironic quotes mentioned by SoA. He quoted from Al-Haythami, who said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u060c \u0648\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThis translates as: It was narrated by Ahmad, and Al-Tabarani in a short form, and the narrators of Ahmad are the narrators of the Saheeh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nAl-Haythami here is very careful with his words, since he does not authenticate the narration, but is only commenting on the narrators. As we all know, the connection of the narration is very important, so one should not be hasty in assuming that words like these mean that the narration is authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWhen returning to Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb 2\/38 we find that Abu Dawud and Abu Hatim Al-Razi both state that Abu Al-Bakhtari did not hear from Abu Sa\u2019eed Al-Khudri, which makes the narration disconnected.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article: \u201cTwo Sahaba won\u2019t Narrate a Hadeeth for Fear of Worldly Loss.\u201d The article was published on the 29th of April, 2012, and can be found here.
