However, Sh\u012b`\u012b works that comment on Quranic sciences are often heavily polemical. Al-Khoei\u2019s work is not an exception. Like Al-K\u016br\u0101n\u012b\u2019s argument that has been thoroughly refuted in a previous article, Al-Khoei presents a report with the intention of arguing that Ahlul Sunnah believe in the permissibility of replacing the words of the Quran with synonyms. In order to argue this, Al-Khoei mentions an event in which Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 allows a man to recite a verse with a different wording.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Khoei then goes on to criticize this position:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf what was intended with this form is that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) permitted the substitution of the words of the Qur`\u0101n with other words that are similar in meaning, which is evidenced by the previous reports, then this possibility demolishes the foundations of the Quran, the everlasting miracle, the established proof upon all mankind, and leaves no doubt that this leads to neglecting the revealed Qur`\u0101n and being careless towards it.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Al-Khoei is merely attacking a straw man since this has never been acknowledged as a valid Muslim position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Abu Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 and the Alternative Recitation<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The report has been documented through solid chains of narrations.

In the first set, Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 is merely saying, \u201c<em>\u1e6ca\u2019\u0101m al-f<\/em><em>\u0101jir<\/em>.\u201d This can be understood as his own explanation. In the second set, Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 explicitly commands the man: \u201cSay: <em>\u1e6ca\u2019\u0101m al-f<\/em><em>\u0101jir<\/em>.\u201d The first set of reports cannot be used to suggest that Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 is teaching a different wording.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In regards to the strength of the reports, they are all authentic, with the exception of the first narration by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm which includes two disconnections. Sa\u2019\u012bd bin Man\u1e63\u016br reports the hadith from Al-Mugh\u012bra, who heard it from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. However, Sa\u2019\u012bd never met Al-Mugh\u012bra, nor did Ibr\u0101h\u012bm hear this report from Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019, as the next three reports above indicate. The editors<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a> hold the view that both disconnections were caused by scribal errors.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a> Either way, the report is not problematic since it is more or less identical with the second report mentioned by Sa\u2019\u012bd bin Man\u1e63\u016br. More importantly, unlike the other reports, the first narration comes through the path of Al-Mugh\u012bra from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, while all the other reports come from Al-A`amash from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. Hence, it is a strong corroboration to the second report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the above in mind, it is hard to say which of the two sets of reports has the correct wording.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Motive behind the Usage of the Synonym<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that the second wording of the report is correct and that Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 did indeed taught the foreigner to use a synonym, one will naturally wonder about Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019s motive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second set of reports provide no reason, while the first set provides a context where the man was a non-Arab who was unable to pronounce \u201c<em>\u1e6d<\/em><em>a\u2019\u0101m al-ath<\/em><em>\u012b<\/em><em>m\u201d <\/em>due to his accent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ab\u016b Bakr Al-Anb\u0101r\u012b (d. 328) comments on an identical report that mentions `Abdull\u0101h bin Mas`\u016bd<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]<\/a> instead of Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019: This is not proof for the ignoramuses from the people of deviation to substitute a word of the Qur`\u0101n with another, for this was only done by `Abdull\u0101h to bring the meaning closer to the student in a manner which prepares him to return to what is correct, to use the truth, and speak upon the word that was revealed by All\u0101h and what was spoken by the Messenger of All\u0101h (peace be upon him).<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p dir=rtl>\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064f\u062c\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0644\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652\u063a\u0650\u060c \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u064a\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0632\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0622\u0646\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0647\u0650\u060c \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0630\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0651\u0645\u0650\u060c \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0637\u0650\u0626\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0631\u064f\u0651\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0639\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064e\u0651\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652\u062a\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0642\u0650\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0651\u0645\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u062d\u0650\u0643\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possibility is that Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019 chose to make the man recite \u201c<em>\u1e6d<\/em><em>a\u2019\u0101m al-f<\/em><em>\u0101<\/em><em>jir\u201d<\/em> since the man simply could not recite \u201c<em>\u1e6d<\/em><em>a\u2019\u0101m al-ath<\/em><em>\u012b<\/em><em>m<\/em>,\u201d and that his using the word \u201cwicked\u201d as a synonym for \u201csinner\u201d would at least be more in line with the Qur`\u0101n than man\u2019s current recitation of \u201cthe <em>zaq<\/em><em>\u016b<\/em><em>m <\/em>tree is the food of the orphans,\u201d suggesting that orphans are guaranteed hellfire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ab\u016b Al-Dard\u0101\u2019s Methodology<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>While building theories on a single isolated incident with variant wordings may seem foolish, it comes as a greater surprise that this is done with Abu Al-Dard\u0101\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he was in Al-Sh\u0101m, the people of the city attempted to correct his recitation.
