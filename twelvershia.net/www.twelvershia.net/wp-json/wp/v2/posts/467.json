Instead of spreading the guidance of Islam and informing the Jews that their Messiah whom God sent to them is Jesus son of Mary (as) the Shia of RTS agree with the Jews that the awaited Messiah is yet to come!! Maybe there\u2019s a hidden agenda by RTS to please their Jewish Masters?

The word \u201cRabbinical\u201d means: [Of or pertaining to Rabbis\u00a0or their learning, writings, etc.] So this literature which RTS used to support their mythical belief isn&#8217;t from any heavenly book which was given to nations in past, rather this literature is the writing of Jewish Rabbis. It\u2019s their views and understandings. And as Muslims, we know where the Rabbis stand when it comes to their understandings and their views, we know that they are rubbish in our sight to say the least.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS tried to somehow fit their mythical Imam Mehdi to be the Messiah mentioned in the Rabbinical Literature. So let us analyze if their mythical Imam Mehdi, is the right candidate to be considered as Messiah from Rabbinical Literature, or it\u2019s just another fraud and deceit from RTS;\u00a0And is there any other candidate who fits as the Messiah mentioned in the Rabbinical Literature?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>WHO IS THE KNOWN MESSIAH FOR MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS?<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Answer:<\/strong>\u00a0Muslims and Christians agreed upon the fact that, Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon both) is the true Messiah.

Because `Isa (as) used to wipe the sick with his hand, this word has been used in the Quran as the title of Prophet Jesus (AS). As such, the &#8220;Messiah&#8221; is the Prophet Jesus(AS) and not the Imam al-Mahdi (AS).\u00a0<strong>However, the word &#8220;Messiah&#8221; in English has another meaning, that is &#8220;Savior&#8221;. As a result, there have been some English translators who used the word &#8220;Messiah&#8221; for Imam al-Mahdi (AS) with the meaning of &#8220;Savior&#8221; which does NOT have anything to do with Arabic word &#8220;al-Maseeh&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>THE MESSIAH IN RABBINICAL LITERATURE, JESUS (PBUH) OR THE MYTHICAL MEHDI OF SHIAS?<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>RTS says:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Rabbinical literature prophecized that the King Messiah (the Qaim) would go through a Ghayba (occultation) :\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<blockquote>\n<div><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Abarbanel; Yeshuot Moshicho 1:2:2 \u201cThe Moshiach will have to die in order to purify the generation and\u00a0<strong>he will wait in a spiritual state in \u201cheaven\u201d\u00a0<\/strong>until he rises from the dead, as it says in the Talmud Sanhedrin [98b].\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Zohar; Parashat Balak 203b states that the Moshiach will have to \u201cdie,\u201d which means go to a higher spiritual level, and return again with the new level he has attained.<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Rabbi Isaac Luria in his comment on Zohar, Parashat Shemot 8b says: \u201cthe man destined to be Moshiach births naturally in this world, and to him is given the [whole] spirit of Moshiach from Gan Eden, making him realize he\u2019s the Moshiach, then\u00a0<strong>he shall be hidden, risen to heaven, and then he shall be completely revealed<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>and Israel will recognize him as Moshiach\u201d (Zohar Harakia).<\/span><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As we previously stated, the one who fits the description of Messiah is Prophet `Isa (as). The quote from rabbinical literature states that the Messiah will wait in a spiritual state in Heaven and will then return. This perfectly applies to Messiah Jesus(pbuh).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The below verses of Quran indicate, Messiah Jesus(pbuh) was taken and raised to heaven, which is the Ghayba(occultation) that RTS claims to be for their mythical Imam:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When God said, &#8216;Jesus, I will take you to Me and will raise you to Me, and I will purify you (of the falsehoods) of those who do not believe. &#8220;(Al-Imran 3: 55)<\/p>\n<p>God raised him(Jesus) up to Him; God is Almighty, Allwise. (An-Nissa 4:158).<\/p>\n<p>Allah&#8217;s Messenger Muhammad (SAW) said \u201cWhat will be your condition when the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you from<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>the heavens<\/strong>?\u201d (Baihaqi&#8217;s Asmaa wal Sifaat 2\/432 Hadith 855)<\/p>\n<p>Prophet Muhammad(SAW)) said: \u201cThen Jesus son of Mary will\u00a0<strong>descend from the heavens<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>and lead the people.\u201d\u201d (Majma&#8217; Al-Zawaid 7\/349. Haithmi said, Bazzar has narrated it and all its narrators are those of the Sahih [i.e. Sahih Bukhari] except Ali bin Munzar and he is also trustworthy).<\/p>\n<p>So, as the rabbinical literature states that Messiah will be risen to Heaven and then will return, we find the same being affirmed for Messiah Jesus(pbuh) from Quran and Hadith.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Note:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0RTS might argue that the rabbinical literature says that Massiah will have a natural birth thus it doesn\u2019t apply to Jesus(pbuh), However as we said in the beginning that the rabbinical literature is just the understandings of the Rabbis, and the Jews didn\u2019t accept Messiah Jesus(pbuh), they accused Mary(pbuh) and rejected her claim and the claim of Jesus that He was born miraculously. Thus obvious to find these hateful Rabbis to preach that Messiah will be born naturally, so as to reject the claim of Messiah Jesus(pbuh) who was born miraculously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RTS says:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The believers, including Israel, will not recognize him even though he will know them.

This is one of the traits of Yousf (as) not only in his own generation, but in every generation, that Moshiach ben Yousf recognizes his brothers, but they do not recognize him. This is the work of Satan,\u00a0<strong>who hides the characteristics of Moshiach ben Yousf (as) so that the footsteps of the Moshiach are not recognized and are even belittled because of our many sins.<\/strong>\u00a0Otherwise, our troubles would already have ended.

This quote is talking about the way the Messiah will be treated before his occultation not after it, because after the occultation and on his return he will be accepted by Israel as the above quote which was provided by RTS states. Anyways we will use the rabbinical quote itself to see what is the most plausible deduction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It is stated in Bible regarding Messiah Jesus(pbuh):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. [John 1:11].<\/p>\n<p><strong>We read in the Glorious Quran:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And when Jesus came with clear arguments he said: I have come to you indeed with wisdom, and that I may make clear to you part of what you differ in; so be careful of (your duty to) Allah and obey me: Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path: But parties from among them differed, so woe to those who were unjust because of the chastisement of a painful day. [Quran 44:63-65].<\/p>\n<p>The bold part from the rabbinical quote provided by RTS states, that Satan will hide the Characteristics of Messiah, So that the footsteps of Messiah are not recognized or belittled. This is what happened with Messiah Jesus(pbuh), His own people didn\u2019t recognize his characteristics, His miracles which he performed by the will of Allah, his clear arguments which are of a true Prophet as stated in the Quranic verses. And even He was offended by Jews, He was belittled as its stated in the Bible.<\/p>\n<p>This rabbinical quote is not talking about Messiah being hidden, rather it talks about him being not recognized by his people, and that his Characteristics won\u2019t be recognized by people. Thus, we find that even this rabbinical quote perfectly fits Messiah Jesus(pbuh).<\/p>\n<p><strong>RTS says:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Attachment to the King Messiah (Qaim) is what brings true faith.

And had he not eased the children of Israel of their sorrows, and taken their burden upon himself, there would be none who could endure the suffering of Israel in the penalty of neglecting the Torah.

It\u2019s their misunderstanding, moreover this doesn&#8217;t even fit the mythical Imam Mahdi of Shias, because He isn&#8217;t suffering during his occultation, neither is He taking the suffering of his Shias upon himself. In fact, their mythical Imam went into hiding into a cave in order to save himself from sufferings and danger, and his Shia are supposed to be trialed with his absence with suffering.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the quote from Zohar;Parashat Exodus, they based their view upon a verse of Isaiah( 53:5), and in accordance to Bible this befits Messiah Jesus(pbuh).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>We find in Bible\u00a0:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Jesus came into Peter\u2019s house, he saw Peter\u2019s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.\u00a0He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the\u00a0<\/strong><strong>prophet Isaiah:\u201cHe took up our infirmities\u00a0\u00a0and bore our diseases<\/strong>.\u201d(Matthew 8:14-17).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus we find that the verse from Isaiah(53:5) which was misinterpreted and misunderstood by the Rabbis This in fact, fits Messiah Jesus(pbuh).

So this Midrash can be understood as Messiah ben Yosef coming back from death as ben David. Actually Rabbi Haim Vital said in his book: Sefer Chizyonot that\u00a0<strong>Moshiach ben David and Moshiach ben Yosef are two titles of two different functions of the same person\u00a0<\/strong>(Sefer Chizyonot page 106).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now the interesting point here is that Messiah Jesus(pbuh) traces back his ancestory or lineage to both Yusuf(as) and Dawood(as) and\u00a0\u00a0they trace back their lineage to Ishaq son of Ibrahim(as).\u00a0\u00a0But sadly(for RTS) the bad news is that, their mythical Imam Mehdi, doesn\u2019t traces back his lineage to Dawood(as) or Yusuf(as), Al-Mehdi is to be from progeny of Prophet Muhammad(Saw), and his lineage is linked to Ismail son of Ibrahim(as) NOT Ishaq(as).\u00a0<strong>Thus Imam Mehdi cannot be considered as Son of Yosef(as) or Son of David(as). However, as we have seen Messiah Jesus(pbuh) can be considered as Son of Yusuf(as) and Son of David(as), as His lineage traces back to these two Prophets.\u00a0<\/strong>Genealogy of Jesus can be read in Bible, Matthew Chapter 1, The Genealogy of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus even this fact proves that the Messiah mentioned in Rabbinical Literature in NO WAY could be considered the Mahdi of Islam or that of Shiasm, Rather the only candidate who fits the description of Messiah, Is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary(pbuh).<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.818181991577148px; line-height: 17.27272605895996px; background-color: #f7f7f7;\"><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THE SHIA FORCE THEIR IMAMS INTO RELIGIOUS TEXTS:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The Twelver Shia just like most Batini esoteric sects will explain any religious text in a way that suits their agenda, we will show the reader some examples of Qur&#8217;anic verses and how they explained them and attributed this to Ahlul-Bayt:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Verse 2:31<\/strong> {And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful.}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u062b\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644: (\u0648\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0627) \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u00a0\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u00a0\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631\u00a0\u0634\u064a\u0639\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0639\u062a\u0627\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0647\u0645<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tafseer al-Hasan al-`Askari pg.217: {And he taught Adam all the names} The names of the prophets of Allah, and the name of Muhammad (as) and `Ali and Fatima and Hasan and Husayn&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0623\u0649 \u0623\u0634\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tafseer al-Meezan 1\/149: It is mentioned in some of the narrations that he (Adam) saw ghosts of Ahlul-Bayt and their lights when he was taught the names&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Verse 40:7<\/strong> {Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying): Our Lord!

Muslims(Ahlesunnah) believe in Jesus(pbuh) to be a mighty Prophet of Allah, We love Jesus(pbuh), We believe that he performed miracles by the will of Allah, We believe him to be the true Messiah. We believe in his second coming. But, we also believe that He was NOT God, neither son of God, rather He was a Prophet of Allah, like the ones before him. And it is incumbent upon the Christians to believe in the final Messenger and Prophet after him, i.e Prophet Muhammad(pbuh), who was also prophesized in Jewish as well as Christian scriptures.Praise be to Allah! In this article we have tried to present before the world the true nature of the Shiites, which is deception and ignorance. In fact, deception and lies are from the religious teachings of Shiasm, as can be seen in their traditions and scholarly verdicts.\u00a0<strong>We have seen how they deceitfully and forcefully try to fit their Imamah anywhere they feel it would benefit their beliefs.<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>They did the same with many verses of Quran, where even when Quran spoke about, Olive, fig or Mount Sinai, they tried to interpret these verses and said &#8220;What is meant here is our Imams&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">After this exposition we expect that we would be labeled as haters of Ahlelbayt, by RTS, they might call us Nasibis, since we shattered their deception to label their Imam as Messiah, by the help of Allah.\u00a0<strong>As, we rightfully defended the rights of the Messiah Jesus(pbuh), when RTS tried to snatch his virtue as\u00a0Messiah\u00a0and attributed it to their mythical Imam Mahdi. They did the same thing with the virtues that were stated regarding the companions of Prophet Muhammad(saw), they stole those and applied to their Imams<\/strong>, but when Ahlesunnah exposed their deceit they accused them of being Nasibis, even though Ahlesunnah affirm the true virtues of Ahlelbayt.Lastly, we request our esteemed readers, especially the Christian converts to Islam, to be aware of Shia deceptions. Since in the initially stages as new Muslims they aren\u2019t much aware of Islamic texts and its principles, and they should take this article as an evidence and a lesson since, they have a background of Jesus(pbuh) and him being a Messiah, So they can easily understand the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>deceptive nature of Shiites.<\/div>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n\u201cTruth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish.\u201d Quran (17:81).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article is  a response to the article on Revisitingthesalaf.org entitled: \u201dImam Mehdi (ajf) in Rabbinical Literature\u201d in which it tried to show that their mythical hidden Imam, is the Messiah prophesized in Rabbinical literature. <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2013\/06\/10\/467\/\" title=\"Response to: Imam Mehdi (ajf) in Rabbinical Literature\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3905,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[5,4],"tags":[16],"class_list":{"0":"post-467","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-imamah","8":"category-quran","9":"tag-mahdi"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/467","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=467"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/467\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3904,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/467\/revisions\/3904"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3905"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=467"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=467"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=467"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
