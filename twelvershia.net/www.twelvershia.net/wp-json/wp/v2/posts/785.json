The leader of their sect al-Murtada wanted to go one step beyond, he wouldn&#8217;t settle for the argument of: &#8220;The Mahdi is like the sun hidden behind the clouds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is what they narrated from their Mahdi in Bihar al-Anwar 53\/181:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;And as for the way of benefiting from me during my occultation, it is the same as benefiting from the sun when it is beclouded; and I am a safeguard to the inhabitants of earth as the stars are safeguards to the inhabitants of heaven.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which makes no sense, so al-Murtada would have none of it! He wanted to argue back and prove to us that the 12th Imam is indeed beneficial, so let me translate what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Shareef al-Murtada in his book &#8220;al-Muqni` fil-Ghaybah&#8221; was asked: &#8220;What good is having a hidden leader? What benefit do we derive from his Occultation?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reply was astounding, this man has surely invented something new! He says that his presence even when hidden scares his followers the Shia -which he describes as his &#8220;Awliya&#8221; since they are the most pious of Shia &#8211; it scares them from committing sins and disobedience, because they fear the punishment of the hidden Imam!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check it out for yourselves:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u062c\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0647: \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0634\u064a\u0639\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a \u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0646\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u062f &#8211; \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0641 &#8211; \u0645\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0628 \u0637\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0647\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u062e\u0627\u0641\u0648\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0643\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0626\u062d\u060c \u0648\u064a\u062e\u0634\u0648\u0627 \u062a\u0623\u062f\u064a\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u0624\u0627\u062e\u0630\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0637\u0648\u062a\u0647\u060c \u0641\u064a\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0643\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u064a\u062d\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0648\u0623\u0644\u064a\u0642\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0647\u064a \u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">[The Awliya(pious followers) of Imam al-Zaman (as) and his Shia and those who believe in him benefit from him while he is in occultation, they benefit as those who are religiously accountable must benefit.

Also, Shia leader al-Kulayni was born in this period, yet he himself was not able to see him or communicate with him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ll comment on the rest later, for now we continue with al-Murtada:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0630\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0648\u062a\u0645\u064a\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0648\u0646 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u062e\u0627\u0626\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0649 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0642\u0628\u064a\u062d\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0624\u062f\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0645\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0626\u062d\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0641\u0627\u0641<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">[Fear from punishment and anger are not tied to knowing the physical identity of the person, or knowing his location, for many of the subjects(civilians) of the apparent present Imam do not know his shape or identity, and in many cases do not know his location, but they are afraid that whenever they do harm he would punish them for it, they benefit from this fear in that it stops them from many bad habits and acts]<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ll inform al-Murtada of how the regular Sunni Muslims behave, they&#8217;re sitting at home, they know they can commit something evil when no one is looking, yet they&#8217;re afraid of doing the evil acts, and this is why:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #003300;\">{They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.} [16:50]<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for those who only desist from doing sins because they&#8217;re afraid of the hidden leader or the rulers, we say to them what Allah (swt) says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #003300;\">{So fear them not, but fear Me, if you are [indeed] believers.} [3:175]<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">May Allah increase the punishment for you O Murtada for these heresies that you invented!

The Shia believe that the entire nation betrayed the Prophet (saw) \u00a0and turned against Ahlul-Bayt and `Ali (ra), then they elected Abu Bakr (ra) instead, wasn&#8217;t this enough for Allah to deprive us from Imams at that point? The Shia believe that the nation killed `Ali (ra) and killed Fatima (ra) and Muhasin (ra), then the nation elected their killer `Umar (ra) as leader, wasn&#8217;t this enough for Allah to deprive us from Imamah back then? The Shia believe that the nation abandoned al-Husayn ibn `Ali (ra), even his own Shia participated in killing him and his entire family, yet Allah didn&#8217;t end the Imamah at that point nor did `Ali bin al-Husayn go into Ghaybah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AND<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Shia are to say that: &#8220;If the Mahdi wanted to guide us he would guide us all, but Allah wants this to be a test for humanity, he wants us to struggle and find the truth on our own.&#8221; Then I say: We Ahlul-Sunnah believe the message ended with the Prophet (saw) and that humanity was then ready to face the test alone with no help of infallible leaders, but you O Shia are the ones who objected and said that: &#8220;NO, Humanity ALWAYS needs an infallible leader, we require a guide from Ahlul-Bayt at all times!&#8221; Also what is the proof that humanity was not ready back then but it suddenly became ready in the time of the 11th al-`Askari?
