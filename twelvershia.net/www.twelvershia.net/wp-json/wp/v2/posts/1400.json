We are going to mention narration about Uthman that he did the same thing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThere is no difference of opinion that A\u2019isha and Uthman prayed in two prostrations, however, it is incorrect to suggest that Sharia Law was changed. As we can see from the narration quoted by ShiaSunni.info, A\u2019isha said, \u201cPrayer, when it first was obligatory, was two prostrations. That\u2019s how it remained for travels and it was completed in civilized areas.\u201d Al-Zuhri asking Urwa, the nephew of A\u2019isha, \u201cWhy did A\u2019isha complete it (instead of shortening it)?\u201d He (Urwa) said, \u201cShe interpreted it the same was Uthman did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe narration is clear that A\u2019isha saw that two prostrations were still applicable for prayers during travel, so how can anyone suggest that she changed Shariah Law?! A more rational suggestion would be that she did not following one of the teachings of the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam), though even this would be incorrect.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTo understand the opinion of A\u2019isha one must first be aware of the ruling of praying two raka\u2019at (prostrations). One of the most used narrations that describes the ruling is the hadith of Ya\u2019ala bin Umayyah, which is narrated by Imam Muslim #1108. The narration is as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nI (Ya\u2019ala) told Omar: And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you. [Surat Al-Nisa\u2019a: 101] Yet now, the people are safe. He replied: I was curious by what caused you to be curious, so I asked the Messenger (salalahu alaihi wa salam) about that and he said: It is a charity from Allah upon you, so accept His charity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nAl-Khattabi in Ma\u2019alim Al-Sunan 1\/226 explains: There is within this evidence that the completion (of prayer) is the asl (basis). Don\u2019t you see that they were curious about the shortening of the prayer due to fear?! If the basis of prayer during travel were two prostrations, then they would not be surprised. This is evidence that shortening is a part of the complete basis; some was remove and some remained. The words: It is a charity from Allah upon you &#8211; is evidence that it is a rukhsa (permission) that they were permitted, and permissions are for matters that are to be made permissible, and not for matters that are decided upon, and Allah knows best.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn other words, Al-Khattabi is saying that it is permissible to shorten the prayer during travels, not that it is obligatory to do so.<br \/>\nThis is supported by A\u2019isha\u2019s testimony in the authentic hadith in Sunan Al-Bayhaqi 3\/143 when Urwa asked her: Shouldn\u2019t you pray two prostrations? She replied: O\u2019 nephew, it is not a tiring for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe narration implies that she understood that the shortening of prayer is permissible, not that it is obligatory. This position is held by Imam Malik, Al-Shafi\u2019ee, and Imam Ahmad. See Hukm Al-Ihtijaaj bi Khabr Al-Wahid itha Amala Al-Rawi bi Khilafih p. 255 by Abdullah Al-Matrifi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn the light of the above, it makes perfect sense why A\u2019isha would teach the sunnah and go against it. Once again, it is because she believed that the sunnah was only a rukhsa (a matter that was made permissible), not that it was obligatory, and that it was optional whether one wants to complete the prayer or not.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to ShiaSunni.info\u2019s article \u201cAisha prayed in the way that is against the Sharia Law.\u201d The article was published on the 26th of March, 2013, and can be found here.
