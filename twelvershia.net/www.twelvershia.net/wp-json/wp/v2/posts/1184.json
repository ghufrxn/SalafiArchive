However, it is not permissible to kill or commit sins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Hasan al-Basri said: Taqiyya is permissible until the day of judgement but one may not kill.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[It was said that, if the believer is residing between disbelievers, and if he fears for his life from them, then he can humor them with his tongue but his heart must be comfortable and content with the Islamic faith. Taqiyya is not permissible except from fear of being killed, or greatly harmed (i.e having the limbs cut). As for the one who is forced to commit an act of Kufr, the correct opinion is that he can disobey and avoid uttering any words of Kufr.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">al-Imam ibn Kathir (rah) expands on this in his book &#8220;Tafseer ibn Kathir&#8221;\u00a0while commenting on the same verses:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[{except one who was forced while his heart is at peace with the faith} This is an exception in the case of one who utters statements of disbelief and verbally agrees with the polytheists because he is forced to do so by the beatings and abuse to which he is subjected, but his heart refuses to accept what he is saying, and he is, in reality, at peace with his faith in Allah and His Messenger . The scholars agreed that if a person is forced into disbelief, it is permissible for him to either go along with them in the interests of self-preservation, or to refuse, as Bilal did when they were inflicting all sorts of torture on him, even placing a huge rock on his chest in the intense heat and telling him to admit others as partners with Allah. He refused, saying, \u201cHe is One, One.\u201d And he said, \u201cBy Allah, if I knew any word more annoying to you than this, I would say it.\u201d May Allah be pleased with him. Similarly, when the Liar Musaylimah asked Habib bin Zayd Al-Ansari, \u201cDo you bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d Then Musaylimah asked, \u201cDo you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah\u201d Habib said, \u201cI do not hear you.\u201d Musaylimah kept cutting him, piece by piece, but he remained steadfast insisting on his words. It is better and preferable for the Muslim to remain steadfast in his religion, even if that leads to him being killed, as was mentioned by Al-Hafiz Ibn `Asakir in his biography of `Abdullah bin Hudhafah Al-Sahmi, one of the Companions. He said that he was taken prisoner by the Romans, who brought him to their king. The king said, \u201cBecome a Christian, and I will give you a share of my kingdom and my daughter in marriage.\u201d `Abdullah said: \u201cIf you were to give me all that you possess and all that Arabs possess to make me give up the religion of Muhammad even for an instant, I would not do it.\u201d The king said, \u201cThen I will kill you.\u201d `Abdullah said, \u201cIt is up to you.\u201d The king gave orders that he should be crucified, and commanded his archers to shoot near his hands and feet while ordering him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then the king gave orders that he should be brought down, and that a big vessel made of copper be brought and heated up. Then, while `Abdullah was watching, one of the Muslim prisoners was brought out and thrown into it, until all that was left of him was scorched bones. The king ordered him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then he ordered that `Abdullah be thrown into the vessel, and he was brought back to the pulley to be thrown in. `Abdullah wept, and the king hoped that he would respond to him, so he called him, but `Abdullah said, \u201cI only weep because I have only one soul with which to be thrown into this vessel at this moment for the sake of Allah; I wish that I had as many souls as there are hairs on my body with which I could undergo this torture for the sake of Allah.\u201d According to some reports, the king imprisoned him and deprived him of food and drink for several days, then he sent him wine and pork, and he did not come near them. Then the king called him and asked him, \u201cWhat stopped you from eating\u201d `Abdullah said, \u201cIt is permissible for me (under these circumstances), but I did not want to give you the opportunity to gloat.\u201d The king said to him, \u201cKiss my head and I will let you go.\u201d `Abdullah said, \u201cAnd will you release all the Muslim prisoners with me\u201d The king said, \u201cYes.\u201d So `Abdullah kissed his head and he released him and all the other Muslim prisoners he was holding. When he came back, `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \u201cEvery Muslim should kiss the head of `Abdullah bin Hudhafah, and I will be the first to do so.\u201d And he stood up and kissed his head. May Allah be pleased with them both.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What we conclude so far, is that the Muslim is allowed to hide his faith and even show disbelief if he fears great harm, but it is more noble and much greater in the sight of God, if one were to die for his belief for the sake of Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shaykh al-Maududi (rah) also wrote in commentary to these verses in &#8220;Tafheem ul-Qur&#8217;an&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[This verse deals with the case of those Muslims who were being persecuted with cruelty and were being-subjected to unbearable torments to force them to give up their Faith. They are being told that if at any time they are forced to utter words of disbelief to save their lives, when in fact in their hearts they are secure against disbelief, they will be pardoned. On the other hand, if they accepted unbelief from the core of their hearts, they shall not escape the torment of Allah even if they succeed in saving their lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It does not, however, mean that one should utter words of disbelief to save one\u2019s life. This is merely a permission but not the ideal thing for a Believer. According to this permission if one utters such a thing, he shall not be taken to account. In fact, the ideal for a Believer is to utter words of truth in any case whether his body is cut into pieces. There are instances which show that during the period of the Holy Prophet some acted upon the ideal while others took advantage of the permission. There was Khabbab bin Art (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made to lie on embers of fire until the fire was extinguished by the melting of his fat, but he remained firm in his Faith. Then there was Bilal Habashi (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made to put on an armor and stand in the scorching heat. Then he was dragged on the burning sand but he went on saying, \u201cAllah is one.\u201d There was another Believer, Habib Gin Zaid bin `Asim, whose limbs were cut one by one by the order of Musailimah, the Liar. Each time his limb was severed it was demanded of him that he should acknowledge the Liar as a prophet but each time he refused to bear witness to his claim of prophethood until he breathed his last. On the other hand, there was the instance of Ammar bin Yasir (May Allah be pleased with him) whose parents were mercilessly butchered before his eyes. After this he himself was put to such unbearable torture that, in order to save his life, he had to utter the same words of unbelief that were demanded of him. Afterwards when he came crying to the Holy Prophet, he said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, they did not let me go until I spoke evil of you and praised their deities\u201d . The Holy Prophet asked him, \u201cHow do you feel about this, in your heart?\u201d He replied humbly, \u201cMy heart is fully convinced of the Faith.\u201d At this the Holy Prophet replied, \u201cIf they put you to the same torture again, you may utter the same words\u201d.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we see from the words of the noble scholars of Islam, Taqiyya is practiced with the enemies from the Kouffar in order to protect oneself from death or great harm! On the other hand, a Twelver Imami Shia will also make a similar claim, he will say that Taqiyya in his religion is also a means to avoid death in extreme cases&#8230; but is this true? or is the Shia lying and practicing his own deceptive version of Taqiyya?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>TAQIYYA IN THE SHIA RELIGION:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We begin by quoting the leaders of the Twelver Shia faith from their own books.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1)\u00a0<\/strong>Shaykh al-Saduq, ibn Babawayh al-Qummi in his \u201cal-I`tiqadat\u201d (p 114) said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Our belief regarding Taqiyya is that it is obligatory.

Most of these lies are attributed to the Imams of Ahlulbayt and mainly the later ones like al-Baqir and al-Sadiq and their children. These Imams of Ahlulbayt lived during the golden age of Islam, from the Umayyad Caliphate starting with Marwan al Umawi until the days of the Abbaside Caliphate of al-Caliph al Ma\u2019moun\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Huge events happened during these years, many wars and invasions and discoveries and disasters which need huge volumes to cover\u2026 We\u2019ll try to very briefly mention some of the events which took place during the lives of these Imams, just to give the readers an idea.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-`Amro bin Sa`eed bin al `Aas took Damascus during the absence of `Abdul Malik bin Marwan and wanted the Caliphate for himself. So battles took place and a siege until ibn al `Aas asked for peace.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; The wars between al Azariqah and al Muhallab which lasted many months. In the year 70 the Roum (Christian empire) was angered and they attacked the Muslims then peace happened between them, on the condition that `Abdul Malik would give their King a thousand Dinars every week. But this was a temporary weakness because of the division in the nation and the presence of two Muslim Caliphs at the same time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; `Abdul Malik prepared Armies to go to Iraq and Mus`ab ibn al-Zubayr went to al-Sham and both armies met and some of Mus`ab\u2019s army betrayed him and defected to `Abdul Malik\u2019s side. Finally Mus`ab was killed with his two children `Isa and `Urwah and the warrior Ibrahim bin al Ashtar and Muslim bin `Amro al Bahili. Then `Abdul Malik took `Iraq and areas around it and placed his brother Bishr as the Ameer, Then Al Hajjaj bin Yusuf was preparing to go to Mecca and fight against caliph `Abdullah Ibn Al Zubayr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Al Hajjaj waged war on Ibn al Zubayr and placed catapults on the hills near Mecca and besieged it. \u00a0After a long month of battles, `Abdullah bin al Zubayr bin al `Awwam was killed and `Abdul Malik took Mecca.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Al Hajjaj then made war with Shabeeb who had killed `Uthman al-Harithi so he sent `Utab bin Waraq al Rabahi after him to fight him around Kufah. He was also killed and his army defeated. Then He prepared al-Harith bin Mu`awiyah al Thaqafi for the fight and their armies met with that of Shabeeb and He was victorious yet again and he managed to kill Abu al Warid al Nadari after that as well.<br \/>\n-Al Hajjaj marched with his army to fight with Shabeeb and they met and the battle was fierce. Then Shabeeb went to al Ahwaz and in it was Muhammad bin Musa al Taymi who met him in a battle which he lost his life in. Shabeeb marched to Karaman and reinforced his troops then went back to al Ahwaz to meet the armies of al Hajjaj led by al Abrad and they fought until nightfall and Shabeeb had to leave by crossing the river but the bridge was destroyed and he died with the rest of the Khawarij who left with him. Then `Abdul Malik himself made a Ghazwah against the Christian empire and took the city of Heracles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-A Plague had hit the people of Sham and it was so strong that they almost all perished. In the next year al Hajjaj sent to Sijistan `Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad al Ash`ath al Kindi who later rebelled and gathered from Al Basrah many Muslims and scholars to fight against Hajjaj and they were able to defeat him at first, and after around eighty four battles the Umayyad armies led by al Hajjaj emerged victorious.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Ibn al Ash`ath almost managed to conquer `Iraq and he gathered 33,000 mounted warriors and 120,000 soldiers and they rebelled but the army of `Abdul Malik was victorious.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the battle of Deir al Jamajem and the slogan was \u201cRevenge for Salat\u201d because al Hajjaj used to delay it from its correct time so the people rebelled.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the Ghazwah of Muhammad bin Marwan bin al Hakam to Armeniah and their armies clashed with the Christian Roum and in one of the battles the Muslims were hit hard and over a thousand martyred.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the great clash near Bukhara between Qutaybah and the Kouffar. Then Sirdaniyah was opened from the Maghrib.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Turk and the people of Faraghanah and the Sughd marched and with them was the son of the Chinese king\u2019s sister and they were a huge army that was unheard of -they say 200,000- So Qutaibah bin Muslim met them and destroyed them. Then the Roum attacked so Maslamah met them in battle and broke them while opening Harathoumah and Tuwanah. Musa bin Naseer prepared his son `Abdullah and took the islands of muwayriqah and munawraqah. His other son Marwan also waged wars and took lands. Maslamah then made a Ghazwah against the Roum and defeated them and took Amouriyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Maslamah attacked Syria and took the five fortresses. The King of Talqan backstabbed Qutaibah with the help of the Turk of Tarkhan but Qutaibah was victorious and then he killed many from the people of Talqan.<br \/>\n-A Huge battle took place between the Muslims and Samarqand and after they opened it they built the mosque. Later the Muslim armies scored huge victories in the east and the west in al Andalus and India.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Muslims made a Ghazwah of Constantinople. Yazeed bin al Muhallab also took Jarjan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the king of the Turk Khaqan fought many long battles against the Muslims and his son died ibn Khaqan died after he was able to kill the Ameer of the Muslims Al Harith bin `Amro in Azerbaijan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the Khazar took Ardabeel by the sword so Hisham sent Sa`eed bin `Amro al Jurashee to Azerbaijan to battle them and he won and took much war booty.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the Turk rebellion in Khurasan and Al Harith bin Abi Shuraih al Khariji joined them so they crossed the river of Jihoun. Then Asad bin Abdullah al Qasree marched against them and he defeated them. Marwan al Himar then opened three fortresses and took the King Touman Shah as a prisoner and sent him to al Sham.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; In al Maghrib lots of wars took place and a huge sect came and gave allegiance to `Abdul Wahid al Huwari and the Berber all supported him. So they fought the Muslims and lost the battle and many of them were killed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; In the Maghrib Kulthoum bin Ayyad al Qusheeri was killed and his army was ripped apart, they were defeated by Abu Yusuf al Azari the head of the Sufriyah. Kulthoum had given the Wilayah of Damascus to Hashim then gave him the mission of fighting the Khawarij in the Maghrib. Then the cousin of Kulthoum who was called Balj al Qusheeri stood firm and he was able to defeat the Khawarij and their leader Maysarah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Abu Muslim al Khurasani took the slaves of Khurasan and defeated the armies and this was the beginning of the state of bani al `Abbas and the defeat of bani Umayyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; In 132 hijri al Saffah was given allegiance by the people of Kufah and he prepared his uncle `Abdullah bin `Ali to fight against Marwan who in turn marched against him with a 100,000, but he lost and Abdullah took the Arab peninsula and asked for al Sham, Marwan ran to Egypt but was abandoned.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-`Abdullah went to Damascus and laid siege, in it was the cousin of Marwan called al Waleed bin Mu`awiyah bin Marwan. They took it by the sword and several thousand of the Umayyads were killed amongst them was its Ameer Al Waleed and Suleiman bin Hashim bin `Abdul Malik.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Battle of al Musnah took place so from those who died was the Ameer Quhtubah bin Shabeeb al Ta\u2019ee al Marouzi one of Bani al `Abbas then his son took control of that army straight away.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Abu Muslim al Khurasani managed to kill the Ameer Suleiman bin Katheer al Khuza`ee al Marouzi of Bani Al `Abbas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-In the year 136 hijri, the Caliph al Saffah died and his state was only 5 years old and there was chaos and many lands in the west of Sudan and the area of al Andalus were lost to the Khawarij and other tribes and groups, then came his brother the caliph Abu Ja`far al Mansour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-In the beginning of 137 hijri `Abdullah bin `Ali heard of the death of al Saffah his brother, so he asked for al Sham for himself and he made camp in Dabiq and claimed that al Saffah gave him the succession. Al Mansour prepared Abu Muslim al Khurasani to battle him and the armies met in the month of Jamadah al Akhir. The armies of `Abdulah were pushed back and he ran away to al Basarah to his brother. Then Abu Muslim found many treasures of bani Umayyah So he rebelled against al Mansour and opted to remove him from caliphate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; In the year 138 hijri the tyrant of the Roum appeared and he was Constantine bin Alion bin Constantine and he had 100,000 soldiers, and made camp in Dabiq. Salih bin `Ali the uncle of al Mansour met him there and the armies clashed until the Muslims were victorious.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; After Constantine burned the new Muslim farms a group called Al Rawandiyyah appeared in Khurasan and they used to believe in the cloning of souls and that their God is al Mansour and that al Haytham bin Mu`awiyah was Gabriel and they went to the castle of al Mansour so he arrested them and others got angry so they marched against him with 600 fighters. `Uthman bin Nuhaik who was the Ameer was wounded in al Hashimiyah so al Mansour replaced him with his brother `Isa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Muslims finally opened the lands of Tabarstan after long wars. Then in the Maghrib the Ameer Muhammad ibn al Ash`ath led an army to fight and destroy the Ibadiyah and he killed their leader Abu al Khattab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; In 145 hirji Muhammad bin `Abdullah bin al Hassan appeared with 250 men in Madinah in the beginning of Rajab. So he imprisoned the Mutawwali of Madinah called Rabah. Then he made a Sermon and the people of Madinah gave him allegiance. He then claimed that he appeared out of anger for Allah and he appointed a governor for Mecca and Yemen and Sham. Then Al Mansour chose his cousin Isa bin Musa to fight him and he did this because he wanted Isa to die as al Saffah had appointed him as his successor while al Mansour wanted his son al Mahdi to rule.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-`Isa marched with 4,000 and he wrote to the Ashraf to get them to side with him so many people abandoned Muhammad bin `Abdullah who in turn refused to seek aid from Egypt but decided to stay fortified in Madinah until Isa decided to march in on him. `Uthman bin Muhammad bin Khalid said: \u201cAnd Muhammad had killed almost seventy men and with him was only three hundred fighters but finally his head was detached from his body and sent to al Mansour.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Ibrahim bin `Abdullah bin al Hassan had rebelled in al Basarah after he entered it in secret with ten people, so he called for himself in secret and 4,000 gave him allegiance. He then sent a `Amil to al Ahwaz and one to Persia and one to al Wasit so he can open them. Al Mansour then sent an army of 5,000 led by Amir al Miski to fight him and they clashed several times, many died in Basarah and Wasit. Finally Ibrahim was killed by an arrow in his throat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And so on\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was just a brief sample of some of the events which were happening during those days in which the Imams were alive. So can you imagine dear reader that the Caliphs and generals of Bani Umayyah and Bani al `Abbas left all the affairs of the state and all those wars and the economy and the plagues and the defense of the lands and the planning of the conquests and fighting the isolationists and exploring the oceans ect? Can you imagine that they left all of this and that instead they dispersed their armies in the mosques and the lands and paid them their wages in order for them to see which one of the Imams of Ahlulbayt would speak about \u201cIf Eve was created from the liver of Adam or not?\u201d Or\u00a0 \u201cif Adam had appeared in India\u201d? Or at what age did Ismail (as) die? Or how many years did prophet Jonah (as) spend in the belly of the whale? Or to see the ruling of one who eats lots of Jarjeer? Or opening the eyes during Wudu? Or wiping the face with a towel after it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No sane human being would accept these ridiculous Shia stories. So from what you just read you can come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no need for this Taqiyya in the first place nor is there a reason which explains why Taqiyya has such a high rank in shiism that they considered it one of their specialties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As said shia shaikh Muhammad Rza Muzaffar in \u201c`Aqa\u2019id-ul-Imamiya\u201d (chapter 33. Doctrine of Dissimulation (Taqiyya):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And this (Taqiyya) is still a sign by which the Shi`ah are known, and which distinguishes them from other sects and other people.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>WERE THE SHIA THE ONLY ONES WHO WERE OPPRESSED BY RULERS?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nThen shia scholars claim that the shia were the only ones being oppressed and that Ahlul Sunnah were not oppressed at all because they agreed to the Aqeedah of the rulers. And this is nothing but blatant lie!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Abu Hanifah al Nu`man was tortured until it was said that he was killed in the prison of al Mansour because he supported the revolutions of several from Ahlul-Bayt like Muhammad and his brother Ibrahim the children of al Hassan (r.a). And he supported the revolution of Zayd bin `Ali Zainul `Abideen against the Umayyads. He had said when Zayd revolted: \u201cHis Khourouj is equal to the Khourouj of the Prophet (saw) on the day of Badr\u201d. He offered Imam Zayd 30,000 Dirhams to fund his revolution.<br \/>\nThen in 145 hijri, He supported the revolution of Muhammad known as al Nafs al Zakkiyah who was from Ahlul-Bayt . Abu Hanifa made a Fatwa on the permissibility of joining his army and he gave him 4,000 dirhams then told him that he had nothing else left to give.<br \/>\nAbu Hanifa was finally asked by the rulers to be the head of judges, as they wanted to win him over to their side, but when he refused this, they imprisoned him and tortured him to death.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Imam Malik ibn Anas also was hit with whips until his shoulder was dislocated as he was of the same opinion as Abu Hanifa. When he was asked \u201cIs it permissible to fight those who make Khourouj against the Caliph?\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s permissible if they make Khourouj on the likes of `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz\u201d, it\u2019s a smart way of telling them that it is allowed to make Khourouj on all other Caliphs. Then they asked him: \u201cWhat if the ruler was not like Ibn `Abdul `Aziz?\u201d He replied: \u201cThen let them fight each other, and let Allah take his revenge from the oppressors with the oppressors\u201d. So he forbade anyone from defending the Caliphs and so he was tortured.<br \/>\nI add, He encouraged going against the Caliph Abu Ja`far publicly during Al Nafs al Zakiyyah\u2019s revolution. The Muslims of Madinah came to him and told him that they can\u2019t join because they have pledged allegiance to the `Abbasi Caliph so he told them: \u201cYou made this Allegiance while you were forced to do so, and the one who is forced does not need to keep his promise (of allegiance)\u201d. So the people hurriedly joined the army of Muhammad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Then the famous hardships which Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal had to face in the days of Al Ma\u2019moun and Al Mutawakkil in the issues of \u00a0\u201cthe creation of the Quran\u201d . Many others died as a result like Muhammad bin Nooh who accompanied Ibn Hanbal and the Faqih and Muhaddith Na`eem bin Hammad and Yusuf bin Yahya al Bouti al Masri the companion of Imam al Shafi`i and his successor. These scholars died in prison. Then you have the grand scholar Ahmad bin Nasr al Khuza`ee who was killed by the Caliph al Wathiq himself with a sword.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And many more such as Ibn Taymiyyah who spent most of his life in Jail, or al-Imam al-Bukhari who was exiled and others\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrating the stories and hardships and the oppression of the scholars of Ahlul Sunnah is a giant task which needs separate books. It\u2019s totally unacceptable and unfair that the Shia scholars trick the laymen and followers by telling them \u2018this or that\u2019 narration is a Taqiyya by the Imam because they were the only victims, and that the caliphs had nothing better to do than to spy on them and hear their news and spread webs of spies to track down their hidden Mahdi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end I find it appropriate to quote the scholars of Ahlul-Sunnah on this matter of Taqiyya and view their stance and then the reader can compare it to that of the Twelver Shia:<br \/>\nIbn Jawzi said in \u201cZaadul Mayser\u201d (1\/361):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\u201cTaqiyya is something permitted but not obligatory. When Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was asked: \u201cIf there would be a sword upon your head, you would again tell the truth?\u201d The Imam answered: \u201cWhen the scholar speaks with Taqiyya, and the layman speaks out of ignorance, who then in this case would reveal the truth?\u201d]<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>CAN THE LEGITIMACY OF AN IMAM BE PROVEN IN CASE OF CONSTANT TAQIYYA?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0In the main Shia book al-Kafi, volume 1, page 284, we find a chapter called:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAffairs that necessitate the proof of the Imam (as)\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By \u201cproof\u201d they mean how you prove that a certain person is a true Imam, because as you know anyone can claim to be an Imam and anyone can claim that anyone else is an Imam, and you can review our article called \u201cTree of men believed to be Imams by the Shia sects\u201d in the respective section.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how do you truly prove the validity or legitimacy of an Imam?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this chapter I quote two authentic Shia narrations:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\u2026`Abdul-A`la said: I told abu `Abdillah (as): \u201cThe one who rushes to claim Imamah for himself, how do we verify him?\u201d He (as) replied: \u201cHe is asked about the lawful and the unlawful.\u201d Then he turned to me and said: \u201cThere are three proofs that are not gathered in anyone unless he were the patron of this affair: he must be the closest of the people to the Imam before him; he must have possession of the weapon (of the prophet (saw)); and his Wasiyyah must be public and apparent \u2013 [so much so, that even] if one had entered Madinah and had asked the commoners and even the little boys, \u201cWhom did fulan depute?\u201d, they would say, \u201cfulan the son of fulan\u201d.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second authentic Shia narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\u2026Ahmad bin `Umar from abi al-Hasan al-Rida (as) I asked him about the indicating signs of the patron of this affair. So he said: The indicating signs to him are: elderliness (i.e. the oldest living son), merit, and the testament \u2013 if men who traveled on horseback and came to Madinah and asked, \u201cWhom did fulan depute?\u201d it would be said \u201cfulan the son of fulan\u201d, and they follow wherever the armaments reside.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on these narrations and other similar ones, the legitimacy of the Imamah of any person is proven if he gathered certain conditions, from them is that the people of Madinah, all of them, men women and children, must know that such and such is the Imam, and he deputed his son so and so after him and gave him the Wasiyyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Question: We know that the main thing that pushes the Shia Imams to practice Taqiyya is because they are afraid of the tyrant rulers, so they hide their Imamah and Wasiyyah out of fear. How then in this case, can the legitimacy of ANY of the Shia Imams be proven if they hide it from the people?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact it is prove from many Shia texts and by confession of their scholars that the Imams would hide the matter of Imamah from their closest followers and this is why even their best companions would be confused as to who is the next Imam after the death of his father.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If this is the case, then how can the little boys of Madinah have knowledge of this matter, so that when the riders come and ask them they say: \u201cSo and so is the Imam and he appointed his son so and so as his depute and successor\u201d!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add, if the Imams do not hide the matter of Imamah and Wasiyyah, then why do they hide smaller insignificant matters? The books of the Shia are full of contradicting Fiqhi narrations, and other narrations which differ with the beliefs of the Twelvers, their scholars explain all of this as \u201cTaqiyya\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Shia were to say that the Imams practice Taqiyya in small Fiqhi matters so they can mingle with the commoners and laypeople of Ahlul-Sunnah, we reply by saying that Ahlul-Sunnah and their scholars had many differences of opinions in many matters of Fiqh. The biggest of the Sunni Imams differed, we take an extreme example, the marriage of Mut`ah: This was the opinion of `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (ra) and Imam ibn Jurayj (rah), yet no one harmed or killed them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is known and popular is that the Imams of the Shia are loved by the Sunni laymen and their problem is not that of Fiqh, because they were not killed one after the other because of silly Fiqhi issues such as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Sadiq was asked about the ruling of the urine of the wild cat, the dog, the donkey and the horse. He replied: \u201cThey are like the urine of humans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tusi said in al-Istibsar 1\/180: \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that these are a type of Taqiyya.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Baqir said: \u201cThere is no harm in the blood of the flea and the urine of the bat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tusi said in al-Istibsar 1\/188: \u201cWe consider this narration as a kind of Taqiyya as it conflicts with the foundations of (the Shia) Madhab.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And we\u2019ve seen sufficient examples of such cases previously in our article should you recall.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our point is that the Imams surely do not give precedence to silly matters such as \u201cpraying while wearing the skin of the fox\u201d or \u201cwashing the clothes after touching the urine of bats\u201d over a giant and dangerous matter such as Imamah, which means \u201cLeadership\u201d in Arabic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather the Shia Imams were killed mainly because of Imamah as the Shia claim, and they were killed by the oppressive rulers and regimes. This happened because they feared that these divinely appointed Imams would challenge them and overthrow them, not because of differences of opinion in jurisprudence, taking into consideration that the Shia accuse these rulers of being irreligious, and that they would drink wine openly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, when the Shia leader al-Murtada was asked about the occultation of the Mahdi, in his book \u201cal-Muqni` fil-Ghaybah\u201d he said that the Mahdi hid himself out of fear from the rulers, so a man asked him:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIf fear pushed him into hiding, then his fathers (previous Imams) were in a state of constant Taqiyya and fear from the enemies, why didn\u2019t they also hide!?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He replied:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[We say: His fathers peace be upon them had no fears from the enemy, because they practiced Taqiyya, and did not act as if they were the Imams, and they denied that they were Imams.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which is true, when we observe the confusion of their followers and companions at the time, and when we read their narrations about Imamah, such this narration from Basa\u2019ir al-Darajat by al-Saffar pg.48:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Verily, our &#8216;affair&#8217; is a secret in a secret, and a concealed secret, and a secret that is only known as a secret, and a secret upon a secret and a secret veiled by a secret.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Or such as when Musa al-Kadhim (rah) is talking to his companion, in the famous narration of Hisham ibn Salim, that describes the confusion of the Shia after the death of al-Sadiq (rah), he tells him:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\u2018Ask, you will have the answers but do not make them public. If you did so it would be slaughtering.\u2019 I asked him and found him to be like an ocean of knowledge that does not diminish. I then said, \u2018May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, your Shi\u2018a, followers and the followers of your father are in loss due to false guidance. Thus, can I meet them and call them to you? I will keep it secret.\u2019 He said, \u2018If you can find intelligent people inform them but make them to promise secrecy. If they make it public it will be slaughter,\u2019 he pointed with his hand to his throat.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our question still remains, if Imamah and Wasiyyah is shrouded by so much secrecy, then how can the little boys and commoners of Madinah know about it?

In Islam, making Taqiyya is uttering Kufr and hiding Iman in necessary situation. In Tashayyu`, Taqiyya is showing Iman and hiding Kufri beliefs such as Shirk and Ghuluw and Tahreef\u00a0 and Takfeer of the Sahabah and other evil matters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Taqiyya in Tashayyu` is not an exception or a dispensation(Rukhsah) in case of necessity, rather it in itself is a necessity and is obligatory, he who leaves it is like he who left prayer, it is not permissible to drop it until the Mahdi or 12<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0Imam rises and is a tool to get closer to their opponents and earn their trust in order to convert them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Taqiyya in Islam is fundamentally practiced against the Kouffar, as for Taqiyya in Tashayyu` then it is essentially against Ahlul-Sunnah, they differ on whether it can be used against Kouffar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- Those who established the belief of Taqiyya in the Shi`ee Madhab wished to divide the nation and to further separate the Shia from the rest of the Muslims, it is to save their belief in infallibility and to avoid telling their followers that their sources are forged and unreliable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Those who fabricated narrations ordering the Shia to keep their beliefs secret, and praising those who never announce their true beliefs, they are the deviants who infiltrated the school of Ahlul-Bayt and wished to keep their falsehood hidden and their reality concealed so they may not be exposed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- The narrations in which the Imams cursed the liars and deviants and extremists were all covered up by the excuse that the Imams only cursed these men to protect them from danger.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- The life of the scholars of Ahlul-Bayt which is recorded in history books opposes Taqiyya, they were all honest and truthful and brave, nothing in their lives agrees with the principals of Taqiyya.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8- Even according to Shia standards, the narrations praising Taqiyya and encouraging it and warning from abandoning it, they are all mainly un-authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9- Many of the narrations of Taqiyya cannot be explained in clear and convincing ways as is apparent from Tusi\u2019s failed attempts to reconcile, which is why some deviants fabricated narrations accusing the Imams of intentionally misguiding the nation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10- Shia scholars have admitted that a lot of the rulings of the school of Ahlul-Bayt were lost because of Taqiyya, and that they differ in one issue on more than twenty or thirty opinions, this led to many Shia abandoning their Madhab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11- They permitted that Taqiyya be used between the Shia as they never trust each other and their scholars always try to offer religious verdicts to please the laymen out of fear from being harmed or losing status, authority and popularity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">12- They have to resort to the reasoning and fallible deduction skills of their scholars in order to know the true religion, which deprives the nation from infallible guidance and defeats the purpose of Imamah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Praise be to Allah and glory be to him, and may His peace and blessings shower our Prophet Muhammad and his family, companions and followers until the day of judgment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Written by Hani al-Tarabulsi al-Shafi`i based on the book \u201cTaqiyya: The other face.\u201d By Faysal Noor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>INTRODUCTION: Taqiyya in the tongue of the Arabs means to fear or to be cautious or wary of something, in order to protect oneself from it. al-Imam ibn Hajar (rah) says in &#8220;Fath-ul-Bari&#8221;
