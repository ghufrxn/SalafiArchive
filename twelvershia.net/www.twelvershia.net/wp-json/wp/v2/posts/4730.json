The independence of these two bodies of transmission is the result of various factors, mainly: (1) the time gap between the authorship of Sunni and Shi&#8217;ite hadith collections and (2) the transmission through generally distinct sources.<\/p>\n<p>These two independent pools of transmission, however, intersect at various instances. This intersection mostly manifests in two phenomena: (1) shared transmitters and (2) shared reports. Such instances\u00a0 give us substantial insight into both traditions and how they respectively dealt with various shared transmitters and reports.<\/p>\n<p>When evaluating shared transmitters in both traditions, one recognizes a rising problem. The Shi&#8217;ite biographical (<em>rijali<\/em>) tradition, which came a couple centuries after the Sunni tradition, regularly endorsed individuals who were identified as forgers, liars and weak transmitters in the Sunni tradition.<\/p>\n<p>The implications of this phenomenon are ginormous: it may finally demonstrate how Shi&#8217;ite authorities arbitrarily endorsed unreliable transmitters. These arbitrary endorsements would have then eventually lead to the formation of the allegedly &#8220;authentic&#8221; Twelver hadith canon, which is the basis of Shi&#8217;ite theology today.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate implication of this phenomenon is that authentication of reports in the Twelver tradition is arbitrary, and that Shi&#8217;ites today cannot actually discern the weak from the authentic in their sources<\/p>\n<h1>The Authority of Sunni Biographers<\/h1>\n<p>Before reading the list, the observer may (rightfully) ask: &#8220;What reasons are there for one to believe that Sunni authorities, in such instances, are more authoritative than Shi&#8217;ite authorities? Could it not be that the Sunni biographers arbitrarily criticized transmitters endorsed by the Shia?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The answer to this question is simple and it manifests in several aspects:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>1.Sunni biographers predated Shi&#8217;ite biographers.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As seen in almost every single example presented below, Sunni authorities predated the Shi&#8217;ite authorities by a significant period of time. The gap in time is often more than two centuries long! This precedence entails that Sunni authorities had greater access and exposure to earlier transmitters.<\/p>\n<p>This can be especially observed in examples # 5, 15, 16, 19, 25, and 32. In these examples the Sunni critics explicitly mentioned meeting and encountering the 3rd and 2nd century transmitters they had criticized. Then, 5th century Shi&#8217;ite authorities, who never met any of these transmitters, magically (and ambiguously) endorsed them in their works without sharing any of their reasoning.<\/p>\n<p>Sunni authorities clearly were more acquainted with these transmitters than the Shi&#8217;ite authorities. We have further elaborated on this phenomenon in our article, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/03\/05\/the-mohseni-dilemma\/\">The Mohseni Dilemma<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. Some of these transmitters were Sunni<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Shi&#8217;ite polemicists often claim that Sunni authorities arbitrarily criticized Shi&#8217;ite transmitters due to their theological biases. This proposition collapses when one recognizes that many of these contested transmitters in both traditions were Sunnis..<\/p>\n<p>This can be seen in examples # 1, 14, 16, 19, and 20, where the Shi&#8217;ite authorities acknowledged that the transmitters were &#8220;<em>Ammi&#8221;\u00a0<\/em>(Sunni). Thus, it cannot be said the criticism of these transmitters was due to the theological biases of Sunni authorities.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, there are various instances where Sunni authorities endorsed the reliability of Shi&#8217;ite transmitters. Shia website, Al-Islam.org, compiled a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.al-islam.org\/articles\/beliefs-rafidi-shiah-narrators-sahih-al-bukhari\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Shi&#8217;ite transmitters in Sahih Al-Bukhari<\/a>. There are tens and hundreds of other heretical transmitters who were endorsed by Sunni authorities. Thus, it is evident that the endorsement and criticism of transmitters in Sunni biographical sources is not based on arbitrary sectarian biases.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>3.The diversity and multiplicity of Sunni verdicts<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As one can see in the list below, Sunni authorities came from various eras, leanings and regions. There is significant diversity among Sunni scholarship. Similarly, there is a substantial amount of corroboration among the verdicts of Sunni authorities.<\/p>\n<p>Shi&#8217;ite <em>rijali\u00a0<\/em>scholarship is mostly limited to a handful of recurring figures. Corroborating verdicts are also quite rare.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon can be especially seen in examples # 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 26, 31, and 32, In these examples, a vast and diverse array of Sunni authorities corroborate each other, as opposed to the Shi&#8217;ite verdicts which are mostly singular.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>4.The transparency of Sunni verdicts<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The methodology espoused by the Sunni critics is well-known and expounded upon in various works. This reality can be demonstrated in examples # 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 &#8211; 19, 23, 25, 31 and 32.<\/p>\n<p>In these examples, the Sunni critics have transparently outlined their reasoning behind their verdicts. As seen, transmitters are often criticized for uncorroborated transmission or the transmission of distorted reports. In other instances, the critics outlined their own experiences with some of these transmitters, which led them to conclude that they were unreliable.<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning behind the Shi&#8217;ite endorsements of these transmitters, however, is ambiguous and unknown. In fact, we do not know whether the verdicts were based on any objective parameters.<\/p>\n<p>The aforementioned reasons, along with many others, serve to demonstrate the superiority of Sunni biographers to their Shi&#8217;ite counterparts.\u00a0 They cumulatively demonstrate why the Sunni verdicts are more authoritative than the Shi&#8217;ite verdicts when they conflict.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, let us evaluate the list of\u00a0 transmitters at hand today:<\/p>\n<h1><u>List of Liars &amp; Weak Transmitters Endorsed by the Shia:<\/u><\/h1>\n<p>In this list, I have mentioned 33 liars and weak transmitters that were arbitrarily endorsed and relied upon by the Shia. I specifically listed the death date of each Sunni\/Shi&#8217;ite authority to demonstrate the proximity of Sunni critics to these transmitters, as compared to the Shi&#8217;ite authorities who generally came centuries and many decades later.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these transmitters were liars and forgers. Others were truthful individuals who severely erred in the transmission of hadith, such that they were declared weak.<\/p>\n<h3>1. &#8216;Abbad b.

The transmission of such individuals forms the backbone of Twelver theology and jurisprudence today.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon is a natural and unsurprising result of carelessness when dealing with the hadith of the Messenger of Allah, and it further demonstrates the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2019\/01\/20\/10-reasons-why-you-should-not-trust-shia-hadith-sources\/\">unreliability of Twelker hadith sources<\/a>.
