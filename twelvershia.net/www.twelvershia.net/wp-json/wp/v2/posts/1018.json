On the other hand, SoA uses the secondary source, Tafseer Al-Dur Al-Manthoor by Al-Suyuti, who quoted from the lost source of Tafseer of Ibn Mardawaih, or by using tafaseer that don\u2019t use hadith chains in the first place. SoA also quotes a narration from Tafseer Al-Tabari that makes no mention of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2017\/12\/31\/yazeed-war-people-madinah-makkah\/\">Bani Umayyah<\/a> making it useless.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only relevant narration that is quoted that actually includes a chain is the narration of Sa\u2019eed bin Al-Musayyab, the tabi\u2019ee. However, his narration comes from the path of Ali bin Zaid bin Jad\u2019aan, who was weakened by Ibn Sa\u2019ad, Ahmad, Yahya, Al-Jawzajani, Abu Zur\u2019ah, Abu Hatim, Al-Nasa\u2019ee, Ibn Khuzaima, Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim, Al-Daraqutni, Ibn Hibban, and others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, SoA also quoted Ibn Al-Jawzi as a source, however, they have failed at quoting his opinion of the hadith of Sa\u2019eed bin Al-Musayyab, which is:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u0628 \u060c \u0648\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062d \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0642\u062f \u0630\u0643\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0646<br \/>\n\u201cThe narration of Ali bin Zaid bin Jada\u2019an from Sa\u2019eed bin Al-Musayyab, was mentioned by most mufasireen, even though it is not correct.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surprisingly, in their follow-up article, SoA quotes another narration that says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">holy prophet asws say in his dream that bani hakam were jumping up and down on his pulpit; when it got morning, prophet said i saw bani hakam jumping on my pulpit like monkeys; narrator said that the prophet did not smiled afterwards till his death<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SoA quotes authentication for the narration, and we are in agreement that the chain seems solid enough. However, this narration is not about Bani Umayyah, but rather, about Bani Al-Hakam. Also, there is nothing about them being cursed in this narration, but that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) disapproves of what some of them said on his Mimbar.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhluBait\u2019s article entitled: Cursed Lineage.
