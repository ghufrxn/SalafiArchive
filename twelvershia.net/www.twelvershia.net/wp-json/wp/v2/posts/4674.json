What is bizarre about this report, however, is that the author of the collection, Al-Daylami, did not list an isnad for it. Rather, he simply said: &#8220;Salman Al-Farisi: Ali is the most knowledge from my\u00a0<em>Ummah\u00a0<\/em>after myself.&#8221;\u00a0(Al-Daylami 1:370). Thus, there is a 5-century-long disconnection in the transmission of this report.<\/p>\n<p>This hadith roused my interest: it cannot be found transmitted in a single canonical hadith collection, so what was Al-Daylami&#8217;s source for this report? I thus expanded the scope of my research to gain a better understanding of the origin of this forgery, and the results were interesting (to say the least).<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Akhtab Khawarezm the Mo&#8217;tazilite (d. 568),\u00a0 transmitted this report from Al-Daylami with an isnad in his notorious hadith collection<em>, Al-Manaqib<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Let us evaluate the isnad listed by Akhtab Khawarizm:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Sharhadar b.

Ziyad, also known as Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi, was the compiler of a hadith collection known as\u00a0<em>Mo&#8217;jam Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi\u00a0<\/em>What is alarming about this report is that it is not found in his collection, which consists of 2460 reports. In his book, Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi transmitted several reports from Nujayh b. Ibrahim from Dhirar b. Surad (some of which being in the virtues of &#8216;Ali, see report #2389), yet this report is not mentioned in the book. Perhaps this may indicate that this report is a later fabrication that was forged after Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi and then falsely ascribed to him. Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi was preceded by an unknown transmitter in this isnad, and it is possible that he was behind the fabrication of this hadith.<\/p>\n<p>Another noteworthy indicator\u00a0 is the preponderance of more reliable reports that conflict with this report and demonstrate the superiority of other companions to Ali in knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Another red-flag in the transmission of this report is the fact that it cannot be found in a single primary source prior to the late 5th century.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems as though Akhtab Khawarezm had filled his book with such evidently fabricated reports. Ibn Taymiyyah thus described him saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Akhtab Khawarezm authored a book on this topic. It contains fabricated hadiths, and their falsehood is apparent to anyone with a bit of knowledge in hadith, let alone the scholars of hadith. He (Akhtab) was not among the scholars of hadith nor was he a referable authority in this field. (Ibn Taymiyyah 5:41-42)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>After a careful analysis of this report and the history of its transmission, it becomes apparent that it is a later fabrication that was falsely ascribed to the companion of the Prophet, Salman. This can be demonstrated in the report&#8217;s:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Worthless and extremely weak isnad<\/li>\n<li>Exclusive transmission in later obscure and non-canonical sources<\/li>\n<li>Conflicting content with a variety of more reliable reports<\/li>\n<li>Absence from the book of Ibn Al-A&#8217;rabi, who was an alleged transmitter of this hadith.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Again, it is unfortunate that Shi&#8217;ite polemicists continue to cite historically worthless reports from unreliable sources to push forth their fallacious theological narrative. Nevertheless, a bit of research and scrutiny is sufficient to dispel these misleading appeals. Such examples serve to remind the average Sunni to be cautious of Shi&#8217;ite polemicists whenever they claim to cite reports from &#8220;Sunni sources.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And Allah is the Witness of Abu Al-Abbas.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sources<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Al-Daylami, Shirawayh.\u00a0<em>Al-Firdaws bi Ma&#8217;thur Al-Khitab<\/em>.
