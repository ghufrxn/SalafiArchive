Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq became an Imam around sixty years after the death of Al-Hussain, which means that for fifty years, the closest companions of the Imams were not taught to cry for Al-Hussain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Narration 37<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The Holy Prophet (S) said: (On the Day of Judgment, a group would be seen in the most excellent and honourable of states.
