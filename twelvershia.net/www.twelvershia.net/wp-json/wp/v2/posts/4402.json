The <em>fitnah<\/em> between Ali and Mu\u2019awiyah is presented as some grand-scale cosmic war that took place where most companions of the Prophet \ufdfa viciously slaughtered each other. However, the evidence indicates that only a tiny fraction of the Sahabah actually participated in the <em>fitnah<\/em> between Ali and Mu\u2019awiyah.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Argument<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Taymiyah said: \u201cRegarding the Sahabah, the majority (<em>jumhoor)<\/em> of them, including the majority of the virtuous among them, did not participate in a <em>fitnah<\/em>.\u201d (Ibn Taymiyah 6: 236)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Bakr b. Al-Khallal in <em>Kitab Al-Sunnah <\/em>(#428) &amp; Ibn Shabbah in <em>Tarikh al-Madinah<\/em> (4\/271) authentically reported that the major <em>tabi\u2019i<\/em>, Ibn Sirin said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe <em>fitnah <\/em>raged, and the companions of the Prophet were around ten thousand in number at that time; and less than a hundred of them attended it. In fact, there were not more than thirty of them.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2018Abdullah b. Ahmed in <em>Kitab Al-\u2018Ilal <\/em><em>wa Ma\u2019rifat Al-Rijal<\/em> (#462) transmits a report from his father, Ahmed b. Hanbal, who said: Umayyah b. Khalid once said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I told Sho\u2019bah: Abu Shaybah told us from Al-Hakam, from \u2018Abdurrahman b. Abi Laylah that he said: \u201cSeventy men from the people of Badr witnessed the Battle of Siffin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sho\u2019bah responded: \u201cBy Allah, he has lied! I have revised this matter with Al-Hakam. We went over this in his house, and we found that no one from among the people of<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Badr witness the battle of Siffin except Khuzaymah b. Thabet.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Abu Bakr b. Al-Khallal in <em>Kitab Al-Sunnah<\/em> (#726) also transmit this report from \u2018Abdullah b. Ahmed b. Hanbal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Taymiyah comments on this report saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: This negation indicates the extreme scarcity of companions who attended the battle, and it is said that Sahl b. Hanif and Abu Ayyub attended it is as well; and Ibn Sirin\u2019s statement is accurate: there are barely a hundred men listed [among the companions who attended the battle]. (Ibn Taymiyah 6: 237)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, if one were to say (for argument\u2019s sake) that a hundred companions of the Prophet participated in the conflict, then that\u2019d be almost 1%. If we were to say that around thirty Sahabis took part in the conflict, as reported by Ibn Sirin, then that means &lt; 0.3% of the Sahabah were involved in the <em>fitnah!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Few Notable Companions of the Prophet Who Did Not Participate in the Fitnah<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Sa&#8217;d b.

Hosain<\/li>\n<li>Muhammad b. Maslamah<\/li>\n<li>Jarir b. \u2018Abdillah<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As evident, most companions of the Prophet \ufdfa refrained from participating in the conflict between Ali and Mu\u2019awiyah. In fact, several reports display some of these companions refusing to take part in the conflict.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0For example, Bukhari reports in his Sahih (#7110) that Harmalah said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Usamah [ b. Zaid] sent me to Ali, and he told me: \u201cHe (Ali) shall ask you: what prevents your companion from coming?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Respond to him saying: He (Usamah) tells you: \u201cIf you were between the jaws of a lion, I would have loved to be by your side; however, I shall not take part in this matter. (Bukhari 9: 57)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Muslim reports in his Sahih (#2965) that \u2018Amer b. Sa\u2019d said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sa\u2019d b. Abi Waqqas was tending his camels, and then his son, \u2018Umar, approached him. When Sa\u2019d saw him approaching, he said: \u201cI seek refuge in Allah from the evil of this rider.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Umar [b. Sa\u2019d] then told him: \u201cYou tend to your camels and livestock, and you leave the people fight for power among themselves?!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sa\u2019d then hit his chest and said: \u201cBe quiet! I\u2019ve heard the Messenger of Allah say: Allah loves the God-conscious, unneedy and unnoticed slave.\u201d (Muslim 4: 277)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The theme is clear: most of the companions of the Prophet were not interested in shedding Muslim blood throughout this conflict. In fact, authentic reports in Shi\u2019ite sources demonstrate key members of Ahlulbait asserting this theme as well:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Saduq, for example, in <em>Kitab Al-Khisal <\/em>(p. 639-640) authentically quotes Ja\u2019far Al-Sadeq praising the companions in this context. Al-Saduq says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahmed b. Ziyad b. Ja\u2019far Al-Hamadani may Allah be pleased with him said: \u2018Ali b. Ibrahim b. Hashem told us, from his father, from Muhammad b. Abi \u2018Umayr, from Hisham b. Abi Salem, from Abu \u2018Abdillah that he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The companions of the Prophet \ufdfa were 12,000 in number: Eight thousand of them were in Medina, two thousand were in Mecca, two thousand of them were among the <em>Tulaqaa\u2019<\/em>. None of them was a <em>Qadari<\/em>, a <em>Murji\u2019<\/em>, a <em>Haruri <\/em>(Khariji), a <em>Mo\u2019tazilite, <\/em>nor a man of <em>Ra\u2019y<\/em>. They used to cry in the day and night, and they\u2019d say: \u201c[O Allah] take our souls before we eat yeast bread.\u201d\u00a0 (Al-Saduq 640)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Referring to the luxury of eating yeast bread at the time.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though participating in the conflict does not delegitimize the status and reliability of any companion of the Prophet, it is unfair for Shias to judge the vast majority of the Sahabah according to an action carried out by a tiny minority among them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The majority of the Sahabah, as demonstrated, refrained from participating in the conflict between Ali and Mu\u2019awiyah, and the burden of proof is upon the Shi\u2019as to demonstrate otherwise.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Sources<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Bukhari, Muhammad b.
