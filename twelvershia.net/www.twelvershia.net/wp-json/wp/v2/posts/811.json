This tactic serves no purpose other than wasting time, it is an easy quick escape for them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s some quick examples to illustrate what I meant:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Shia are accused of adding an innovated expression to the text of the call to prayer &#8220;`Aliyyan Waliyullah&#8221;. They counter by saying that it is Ahlul-Sunnah who added the innovation of &#8220;al-Salat Khayrun min al-Nawm&#8221; to prayer, although we Ahlul-Sunnah can prove our case from authentic narrations and they cannot.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Shia are accused of believing in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, their books are full of narrations accusing the companions of deleting verses in favor of `Ali (ra) or narrations accusing them of changing the position of verses to corrupt the general meaning of the Qur&#8217;an. They counter by finding Sunni narrations about abrogation or different recitations and accuse the Muslims of believing in Tahreef.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-The Shia are accused of not placing any effort in preserving the Qur&#8217;an or its recitation or sciences. They counter by saying that it was they who preserved and collected the Qur&#8217;an,\u00a0and that the most popular chain of transmission of Qur&#8217;an is a Shia one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We&#8217;ll stop at this last example because it is our subject for this article. As we all know, the Qur&#8217;an is Mutawatir, meaning mass transmitted, meaning there were thousands of companions reciting the Qur&#8217;an and thousands upon thousands of \u00a0followers learning it and teaching it to their children. At this point you might ask: &#8220;If so many people are reciting it, why then do we have a smaller number of chains for the Qur&#8217;an?&#8221; The answer is that these chains are documented by the specialists and the expert reciters, to preserve in a scientific and authentic way the exact recitation and pronunciation of the words, they&#8217;re not meant to preserve the text of the Qur&#8217;an but to preserve the way it was recited by our ancestors, and when we say &#8220;ancestors&#8221; we mean the best reciters of their time and not just any random Arab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a popular fact that the Qur&#8217;an is collected, preserved and spread by Ahlul-Sunnah, so what&#8217;s the problem then?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem is that the Shia have a counter argument, whenever we tell them that we preserved the Qur&#8217;an, they say NO, it was us! The Qur&#8217;an which is being printed in Saudi is the recitation of Hafs, from`Asim, from al-Sulamy, from `Ali ibn abi Talib and they&#8217;re all Shia, not one of them is Sunni. Also Sunnies know that `Asim and Hafs are Shia which is why they accuse them of being liars! We challenge the Sunnies to provide us with one chain that they themselves preserved!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This sort of thing has been posted on Shia forums and I&#8217;ve even seen one of their own moderators refute it as it made no sense to him, I&#8217;ll quote what he says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[It sounds like you have no idea how the Qur&#8217;an was preserved according to the Sunnis. First of all, the 7 mutawatir Qiraa&#8217;aat, according to them, is not the Seven ahruf, but they are parts of different ahruf. Those narrations you quoted above are the different ahruf that no long exist and were destroyed after standardization of the Uthmanic codex &#8211; the 5 imam Qur&#8217;ans were distributed to their respective city-states\/regions (Medina, Makka, Shaam, Kufa and Basra). These imam Qur&#8217;ans differed with one another in terms of rasm &#8211; more or less letters\/different letters, in a few places. The Medani and Kufi codex have like 52 differences in rasm. These original manuscripts had no nuqaat or tashkeel. No hamzas either.<\/p>\n<p>Also, they do have sunni chains, seriously. I would suggest you open up al-Jazaris al-Nashr fee Qira&#8217;aat al-`Ashr and look up all the different Turuq for each of the different Qira&#8217;aat. Warsh alone has like 84 &#8211; not Shi&#8217;i at all, as far as I know. And it should be noted that these &#8220;Shi&#8217;a&#8221; in these chains and different Qiraa&#8217;aat cannot be proven to be Imami &#8211; as in believed in divine Imamah and `isma of those Imams etc etc. When classical Sunni literature just uses the word &#8220;Shi`ah&#8221; or &#8220;`Alawiy&#8221; by itself, it usually indicates what we&#8217;d call Zaydis or proto-Sunnis that were just politically Shi`ah or the like. Imami is shown more so when they use the word rafidhi or a &#8220;ghali&#8221; Shi`ah &#8211; someone with &#8220;extreme&#8221; Shi&#8217;ism. The only Rafidhi I know in the Qiraa&#8217;aat chains is Humran b. A`yun [ra], and they admit this and are okay with it cause transmitting Qur&#8217;an and transmitting hadith is different for them.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be really nit-picky, Sayyid al-Khui [ra] in his book al-Bayan goes out of his way to weaken ALL of the Qurraa&#8217; and their reciters as problematic in some way.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s really problematic, for us, is that there is no &#8220;Shi`ah&#8221; collective effort to preserve the Qur&#8217;an. No books about Qira&#8217;ah from the early Shi`ah (except al-Sayyari&#8217;s book&#8230;which is problematic &#8211; this is a severe understatement). We had part in it, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but the information about that is preserved by them, not us.]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above is accurate, and it is a good refutation of their comedic claim. However, we will go into some detail in refuting the above accusation that the Shia made.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah has honored and blessed Ahlul-Sunnah by allowing them to collect his words in a book, preserve its chain and recitation for later generations, and he honored them with printing, publishing and spreading his message to the people of the world. It is thus the duty of every Muslim to defend this religion if he is capable and to refute the people of innovation and deviance, that is surely from the best of struggle in the cause of Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Imami Shia sect known as the Ithna`Ashariyyah (Twelvers) have no chain of transmission to the Qur&#8217;an, not even a weak one, they only rely on Ahlul-Sunnah in this matter. We&#8217;ve seen lately some of their so called scholars (al-Khu&#8217;i) weakening the chains of the Qur&#8217;an in an attempt to lower its significance and value and the hard work the Muslims placed in preserving it, they will attack the reciter Hafs bin Sulayman al-Azdi in order to fulfill this evil goal. On the other hand, we see some Twelver Shia &#8220;scholars&#8221; praising Hafs bin Sulayman and adopting him as one of their own in an attempt to steal a solid Qur&#8217;anic chain that belongs to Ahlul-Sunnah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From here we begin,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>1-How can Hafs and `Asim be from the Imams of recitation if they are weak?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, it is not acceptable for you Shia to quote the rules and laws found in the books of your opponent and explain them based on how you understand them. You must always explain their rules based on their own understanding of it, otherwise you are following your desires and wasting you time. When Ahlul-Sunnah transmit a weakness in Hafs or Sulayman, this weakness is in the transmission of narrations it is not a weakness in Qur&#8217;anic letters or recitation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, the terminology used by the early scholars and Imams of Hadith sciences must be understood the way they intended, it must be understood after a thorough study and a calm observation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Here is what they say\u00a0about the reciter`Asim ibn abi al-Nujoud al-Asadi:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam ibn al-Jawzi said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062b\u0628\u062a\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0642\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0648\u064a\u062a\u0642\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0648\u064a\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[He was precise and firm in his recitation, weak in narrating, because he did not perfect the art of narrating however he perfected the art of Qur&#8217;anic recitation, and he himself is honest.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam al-Dhahabi said about him:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0641\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0641\u062b\u0628\u062a\u064c \u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[As far as recitation he is a firm Imam, and as for narrating then he is good.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0635\u0645 \u062b\u0628\u062a\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u060c \u0635\u062f\u0648\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0648\u062b\u0642\u0647 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u060c \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u062d\u0627\u062a\u0645 : \u0645\u062d\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062f\u0642 \u060c \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0637\u0646\u064a : \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0641\u0638\u0647 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u060c \u064a\u0639\u0646\u064a : \u0644\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[`Asim was firm in recitation, trustworthy in narrating.
