The article can be found here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this article, ShiaPen makes two claims. The first is that `Ali did not pray behind Abu Bakr. The second is that praying behind someone does not mean that the Imam is superior.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are in agreement with ShiaPen that the Imam of the prayer is not necessarily superior to those that pray behind him. There is a consensus among the people of Islam that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) prayed behind Abu Bakr, and yet, there is no difference of opinion that he (salalahu alaihi wa salam) was superior to Abu Bakr. However, we wish that the Shia who quote the Sunni narration of `Isa (as) praying behind the Mahdi to stop claiming that this is a proof for the superiority of the Mahdi over all prophets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this in mind, there is no reason for Shias to doubt that `Ali prayed behind Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, ShiaPen quotes a narration to prove that Ali\u2019s prayer behind Abu Bakr was a show, and that he prayed silently to himself. The narration goes as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"right\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u00a0<strong>\u06d4\u06d4\u06d4 \u0648\u062d\u0636\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0648\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0628\u0649 \u0628\u0643\u0631 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0648\u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0646\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0641\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u06d4\u06d4\u06d4<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">\u00a0<strong>\u201c<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ali (as) entered the mosque, and got behind Abu Bakr, and started offering his prayers alone (Waa Sala le Nafsihi<\/span>)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, when we return to the source of the narration, which is Tafseer Al-Qummi, we find that this is the chain used for the report:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u064a\u0633\u0649 \u0648\u062d\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy father narrated to me, from Ibn Abi Umair, from Uthman bin Eisa and Hammad bin Uthman from Abi Abdullah (alaihi alsalam)&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We say: The narration is weak since there is no proof that the book is correctly attributed to Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Qummi. The narration also comes through Ibrahim bin Hashim who is an anonymous narration and has not been praised or referred to as trustworthy by the early Shia hadith scholars. Most importantly, according to ShiaPen\u2019s standards, the narration should be rejected since they hold that Ibn Abi Umair is weak.
