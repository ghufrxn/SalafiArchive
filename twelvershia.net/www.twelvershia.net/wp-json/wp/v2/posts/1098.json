The protected one from evil advisors is one who is protected by Allah. It does not mean that those that are protected are infallible. It almost seems as if SoA put the word \u201cma\u2019soum\u201d in the search engine, and found this hadith, which has nothing to do with the Shia perception of infallibility.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe very context of the narration implies a fallible nature to these prophets and caliphs, since they are all susceptible to the advice of the evil cohorts. Moreover, according to the Shia understanding of Imamah, the Imam does not need good advisors, or any advisors at all in the first place. So as we can see, the topic has nothing to do with the Shia concept of infallibility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled \u201cInfallibility, as per Sahih Bukhari\u201d.
