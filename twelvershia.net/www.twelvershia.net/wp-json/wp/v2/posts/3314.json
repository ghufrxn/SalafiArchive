He announced\u00a0this explicitly at the beginning of his book of Tafsir and filled it with such narrations, while noting that he declared his commitment to only mentioning in it what he receives from his trusted teachers. This was also the belief of his student, Thiqat-ul-Islam al-Kulayni may Allah have mercy on him as attributed to him by a group of scholars. This is because al-Kulayni reported\u00a0a large amount of explicit narrations in this regard (i.e Tahrif) in Kitab-ul-Hujjah especially in the chapter &#8220;Al-Nukat wal-Nutaf min al-Tanzil&#8221; as well as in Kitab-ul-Rawdah, he never objected to them nor did he give them a convenient interpretation.

In order to prove their belief, they held on to the verses and narrations that cannot be overlooked.

While al-Kulayni may not necessarily believe in the authenticity of every individual\u00a0narration on its own, for instance he may declare a belief then list five narrations under it. Al-Kulayni doesn&#8217;t need to necessarily believe in the authenticity of all five yet it&#8217;s sufficient for him that one or two are authentic and the rest serve as a back-up to reinforce this belief.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our case, it is enough for al-Kulayni to mention loads of narrations clearly implying the distortion of the Qur&#8217;an, by doing so he has established this belief even if he doesn&#8217;t necessarily believe every single report is authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below you will see the words of al-Kulayni and the words of other Shia scholars that clearly point to what we wrote above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Kulayni confirmed the authenticity of his reports\u00a0in the introduction of his book 1\/8:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving authentic\u00a0[Sahih] narrations of the truthful ones (as) and the upright and acted upon traditions from it\u2014through which the compulsory duties of Allah, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled.\u00a0And you said: \u2018If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allah will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.\u2019]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the above we conclude that the man clearly asked for reliable authentic teachings, so al-Kulayni answered the call saying:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Allah, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meaning, he confirms that the book he compiled is indeed sufficient for them and is up to the standards in terms of authenticity and reliability.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia leader and expert in the field of narrations, al-Hurr al-`Amili commented on this in &#8220;Khatimat Tafsil al-Wasa&#8217;il&#8221; 30\/196:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points.\u00a0One of these points is: His statement: \u2018Authentic narrations.\u2019 It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [Sahih] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-authentic narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will be further explained.\u00a0Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [Sahih] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness [Tawatur].]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also wrote in &#8220;Wasa&#8217;il al-Shi`ah&#8221; 20\/96-97:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[The authors of the four books and their likes were more than capable of distinguishing what&#8217;s authentic from what isn&#8217;t.

In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [Mujtahid] is not proof for those of the same stature.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In brief he says al-Kulayni&#8217;s Ijtihad is not binding upon other scholars since they can differ in their judgment of what&#8217;s authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ayatullah Husayn `Ali al-Muntazari writes in &#8220;Dirasat fil-Makasib al-Muharramah&#8221; 3\/123:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[The belief of al-Kulayni about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>D- Objections or arguments that may arise in opposition to\u00a0the above.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here we reach the end of our article and we shall mention our opponent&#8217;s weak defense to what we established above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Their first argument will be: Kulayni says to refer back to Allah&#8217;s book and dismiss what opposes it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We answer: Why didn&#8217;t he dismiss them then? Instead, we find that he includes them and quotes a lot of them in his book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is because the above is listed in the introduction of al-Kafi, the context is that the man was describing to al-Kulayni how it is impossible for him and his people to differentiate between all contradicting\u00a0narrations coming from \u00a0the Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why al-Kulayni&#8217;s book does not have much contradictions, since al-Kulayni did not include the reports that oppose what he thinks are the correct teaching of Ahlul-Bayt. Al-Kulayni included only what he wished for the Shia to adhere to including plenty of reports about Tahrif.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Kulayni tells the man in the introduction that the Imams specified three ways to distinguish what&#8217;s correctly attributed to them:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Present the conflicting\u00a0reports to Allah&#8217;s book and reject what opposes it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(This does not conflict with the belief in the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an, because al-Kulayni and his likes believed the Qur&#8217;an was simply missing some of `Ali&#8217;s merits and the flaws of his opponents. As for the general context and rulings, they are intact and thus one is able to present narrations to it and see which ones hold-up.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Present the conflicting reports to the beliefs of Ahlul-Sunnah and dismiss what agrees with them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Ahlul-Sunnah believe the Qur&#8217;an is\u00a0un-distorted and so the opposite would be to accept the Shia reports declaring the corruption of the Qur&#8217;an)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Follow the consensus of the Shia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Shia have a lot of disagreements and that&#8217;s why Kulayni wrote\u00a0al-Kafi in the first place. This option is invalid)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">-Their second\u00a0argument will be: A narration is reported in al-Kafi 8\/53 that implies the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered.<\/p>\n<p>The report in question is regarding a letter by abu Ja`far Muhammad bin\u00a0`Ali:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[(with his chain) Yazid bin `Abdullah, from whoever told him, he said: Abu Ja`far (as) wrote etc&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The long narration continues with the Imam criticizing the commoners until he writes:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[The result of their abandonment of the Book, is that they upheld its letters but distorted its limits. They read it but do not care for it, so the ignorant among them is pleased with their memorization whereas the scholars are aggrieved at their lack of care]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We answer: This does not mean that the Qur&#8217;an is unchanged. When the Imam says &#8220;They upheld its letters but distorted its limits&#8221; he means that they took great care of reciting it in the best manner and cared more for the pronunciation of its letters than they did for respecting its laws, limits and rulings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their renowned scholar Al-Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani writes in &#8220;Al-Durar al-Najafiyyah&#8221; 4\/69:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[As for the narration in &#8220;al-Kafi&#8221;, what&#8217;s apparent is that it means that the commoners upheld the letters &#8211; meaning, by reciting with good voices and adhering to the etiquette of recitation as well as all favorable means they established among themselves, in addition to finishing its entire recitation on a regular basis. However, they corrupted its limits by giving it their own personal interpretations without returning back to the people of revelation (i.e Imams) to learn\u00a0its laws and prohibitions. This is what&#8217;s apparent from the narration, thus it contains no evidence for what they claim.]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, al-Bahrani is disproving those who argued with the report to prove the Qur&#8217;an is un-tampered and un-corrupted, he answered as you saw above by saying this is clearly not the case and the report does not constitute legitimate evidence for their stance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We hope that this is sufficient evidence for all those with intellect that al-Kulayni is one of the staunchest believers in Tahrif, that this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; accusation as they claim and we hope that the article is a solid testament to the corruption of Twelver Shia faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Muhammad bin Ya`qub al-Kulayni is disputably the top Twelver Shia Hadith scholar to ever walk the earth.
