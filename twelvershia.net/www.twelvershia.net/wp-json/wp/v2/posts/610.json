Since this Shariah should serve as a guide to humanity till the end of the times, that is why Allah took the responsibility of preserving the Quran Himself, because it is the main source of Shariah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The beauty of our Islamic law or Shariah is that it guides us in all spheres of our life. And its message is not for one race only, but it is for the entire humanity. That is why Allah bestowed the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) with the best family members, and the best companions, as they were the ones who were responsible to teach the Shariah to the people after the death of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). We can\u2019t expect that the ones who are responsible for teaching the Shariah would hide Quran or its divine interpretation as Shias claim.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly the life of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) should also be sufficiently known to the people because the Holy Quran says:<br \/>\n{There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.} [Quran 33:21]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now a part of the life of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) can be known from his companions, but a part of his life which deals with how he lived inside his home can only be learned from his wives, because he had no sons, and his four daughters were married before the battle of Uhud, which happened in 3 AH. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) knew this very well, and hence he put special effort in teaching his wives too, besides teaching his companions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ummul Momineen Ayesha\u2019s narrations mostly deal with how the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would live inside his home, and how he behaved with his family members. The fact is that in the Shia books, we rarely find the narration of any wife of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). And when Ummul Momineen Ayesha narrated how the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) lived in his home, the ignorant started accusing her of mentioning immoral things. But little do they know that if this is to be considered immorality, than this \u2018immorality\u2019 is present in the narration of their Imams as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS starts by mentionning a movie called \u201cThe innocence of Muslims\u201d, he says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">we have a question: \u2018Is the film depiction at variance with the portrayal of Prophet (saw) in the main corpus of authority Sunni works?\u2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> If you ask the average Sunni Muslim on the street, he will provide an impromptu response that it is. It is unlikely that most Sunni Muslims would have ever consulted any of these books, they have simply taken to the streets at the behest of their Mullah\u2019s who have through their incendiary speeches duped the masses into assuming that the film depiction of Muhammad (saw) is alien to Islam, and that people should therefore vent their anger by way of violent protest. What these poor adherents are not told is the truth, that the very depictions, that formed the basis for this obscene piece of film making is not out of kilter with the Sunni Muslim depiction of Muhammad (saw) in the authentic Sunni world, on the contrary it concurs with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I watched the first ten minutes of the movie, and I can say very easily that it is so disgusting that even a neutral person will declare that it is complete misrepresentation of what is present in the Sunni books. I am amazed at how on earth have the RTS claimed this nonsense!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s begin with the arguments of Shias and lets see whether the same can be found in the Shia books as well or not.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">We read in Saheeh Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 18:\u00a0Narrated \u2018Urwah: The Prophet asked Aboo Bakr for \u2018A\u2019isha\u2019s hand in marriage. Aboo Bakr said \u201cBut I am your brother.\u201d The Prophet said, \u201cYou are my brother in Allah\u2019s religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.\u201d\u00a0Note how the narrator of this tradition is Urwah the nephew of Aisha, not Aisha herself who is presenting the discussion as an eye witness, by the side of Aboo Bakr, clear as he did not attribute the tradition to anybody else, saying I heard from so and so, rather he states the Prophet (saw) asked for the hand of Aisha and grandfather said \u201cBut I am your brother.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Now think carefully Urwah is the younger brother of Abdullah ibn Zubair, who was born in Madina, and this alleged incident occurred when Aisha was six years of age!A lesson can be gauged from, the tradition.\u00a0\u00a0Aboo Bakr was initially apprehensive at the proposal as the Prophet (saw) was his brother thus making Aisha his niece, hence making such a union invalid.\u00a0\u00a0The Prophet (saw) draws up a clear distinction between brothers in religion and brother through bloodline.\u00a0\u00a0Does this not evidence Aboo Bakr\u2019s lack of knowledge on the matter?\u00a0\u00a0Is this not disrespectful of Aboo Bakr?\u00a0\u00a0The reality is this was an attempt by Urwah to establish some familial link with the Prophet (s). Sadly we know the bonds of brother were made between the companions on two occasion, and on both the Prophet (saw) took Imam Alee (a.s) as his brother nobody else!<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0We shouldn\u2019t expect the people to have known the whole religion from the day they are born. Especially in the case of the companions, who were in the era when Islam was in the process of completion, rather than being in a complete form. Hence, Abu Bakr definitely had a question as the Prophet (saww) had declared him his brother. So he had a definite question if it would have similar effect on his relations with the Prophet (saww) as a biological brother will have. The Prophet (saww) clarified to him that it was not the case, Abu Bakr agreed to it and married his daughter to the Prophet (saww). I don\u2019t find anything wrong with this, but what the Shia Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Taqi Musawi Isfahani\u00a0says in his book \u00a0\u2019Mikyal al-Makarim\u2019 is definitely worth reading.<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We read in the book of Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Taqi Musawi Isfahani:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cthere is a traditional report mentioned in Mazar Bihar and other books quoting Azadi that he said: In Medina I came out to go to the house of His Eminence, Abu Abdullah Imam Sadiq (a). On the way I met Abu Baseer, who was in a state of ritual impurity (requiring bath), although I didn\u2019t know at that time. Both of us together came to the Imam and saluted him. The Imam raised his head and said to Abu Baseer: O Abu Baseer, do you not know that it is inappropriate to enter the Prophet\u2019s houses in a state of ritual impurity? So Abu Baseer returned and after he had bathed, we came back to the Imam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><sub><strong>Reference :\u00a0<a title=\"External link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.maaref-foundation.com\/english\/library\/pro_ahl\/imam12_mahdi\/mikyal_al-makarim\/32.htm\" rel=\"nofollow external\">Mikyal al-Makarim p. 776<\/a><\/strong><\/sub><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The infallible Imam of Shias exposed Abu Baseer, who would enter the house of the Prophet (saww) in the state of ritual impurity, while fully knowing that it was not allowed to enter the Holy Mosque in the state of ritual impurity. So if we have to criticize anyone, it should be Abu Baseer rather than Abu Bakr.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Sahih al-Bukhari we read that `Ali (ra) for example was ignorant of a specific Fiqhi ruling:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I used to get emotional urethral discharge frequently.

Why would the Prophet (saww) marry her, especially if he had no love for her, and if she had virtue or honor? Let RTS clarify why did the Prophet (saww) marry her?
