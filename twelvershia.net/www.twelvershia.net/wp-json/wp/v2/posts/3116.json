What makes it stranger is that Fatima, at the end of the narration, accepts Abu Bakr\u2019s claim that he will take control, a minute after he admitted that the Prophet\u2019s inheritance is to be given to his heirs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no doubt that the root of the confusion is Al-Waleed bin Jumai\u2019.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Upon further research, we find that there is a similar narration in Musnad Ahmad #57, that contains similar information, but without the contradiction. Abu Salama narrates that Fatima asked Abu Bakr, \u201cWho would inherit from you if you died?\u201d He replied, \u201cMy children and family.\u201d This fits in more with the narration of Ibn Jumai\u2019 in which she asks, \u201cWho inherited the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; ?\u201d In which he responded, \u201cHis family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, this narration is also weak since Abu Salama did not hear from Abu Bakr or Fatima, so the narration is disconnected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet, this narration is more acceptable than the narration of Ibn Jumai\u2019 since it does not contradict the historical reality and does not include contradictions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to Slave of Ahlubait\u2019s \u201cheirs of holy prophet and their right upon on the property of holy prophet (asws)\u201d.
