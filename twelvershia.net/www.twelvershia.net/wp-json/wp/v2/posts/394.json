Husain reported that when they came to Medina from Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said:<strong>fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion.<\/strong>\u00a0He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place. (Sahih Muslim)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And in another Lafdh:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8216;Ali b. Husain reported that Miswar b. Makhramah informed him that &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent the proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl as he had fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), (as his wife). When fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth.<strong>\u00a0Verily fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial, by Allah the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person<\/strong>.

There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O abu bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of abu bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to abu bakr&#8217;s house and asked if abu bakr was there.

I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while abu bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice,<strong>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrated Abu Ad-Darda: There was a dispute between Abu Bakr and `Umar, and Abu Bakr made `Umar angry.

So Abu Bakr went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while we were with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (SAWS) said, &#8220;This friend of yours must have quarrelled (with somebody).&#8221; In the meantime `Umar repented and felt sorry for what he had done, so he came, greeted (those who were present) and sat with the Prophet (SAWS) and related the story to him.\u00a0<strong>Allah&#8217;s Apostle became angry\u00a0<\/strong>and Abu Bakr started saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

When I said, &#8216;O people I am sent to you all as the Apostle of Allah,&#8217; you said, &#8216;You tell a lie.&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;You have spoken the truth .&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Comment: Above we see that the Prophet (SAWS) became angry NOT for the anger of Abu Bakr (ra) but for something much much less than the anger of Abu Bakr (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Question:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do the Shia accept that Allah became angry for the anger of Abu Bakr (ra)?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only that, the Prophet (SAWS) also becomes extremely angry for the weak and the elderly&#8230; we read in al-Bukhari:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud: A man came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!
