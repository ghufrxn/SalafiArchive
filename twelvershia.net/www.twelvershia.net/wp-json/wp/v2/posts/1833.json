His comments are made because he does not see the logic in Abdullah bin Amr\u2019s actions. For one that believes himself to be on the side of the \u201crebels\u201d, who is condemning his own party, would not usually stick with the same group.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIn another authentic narration, in Musnad Ahmad #17110, we find Mu\u2019awiyah\u2019s first reaction to the news that Ammar was killed and to the hadith, which in this case was narrated by Amr bin Al-Aas. He said, \u201cWe killed him?! It was Ali and his companions that tossed him upon our spears\/swords that did it!\u201d Since they allowed `Ammar to fight while he was above ninety years old.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nAs we can see in this narration, Mu\u2019awiyah is not rejecting the narration, but using it as evidence against Ali. He does not accuse Amr bin Al-Aas either, for he believes that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said those words.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note:<\/span> We do not agree with Mu\u2019awiyah\u2019s interpretation of the hadith, but we have included it in order to show that he did accept the narration as authentic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article, which he entitled: \u201cMawia Charging a Sahabi with Madness upon hearing a Hadeeth: Authentic Narration.\u201d The article was published on the 4th of March, 2012, and can be found here.
