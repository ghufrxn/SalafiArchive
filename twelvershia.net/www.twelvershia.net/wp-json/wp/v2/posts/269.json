Then, starts to quote statements by scholars of Ahl Al-Sunnah in which they praise of the reliability of Khariji narrators. RTS argues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Unknown to many the connection with the Khawarij is more closer to home for the so called &#8216;Ahl Sunnah&#8217;.

But when I tell you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) and they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of Resurrection!.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Source: Saheeh Bukhari.\u00a0Pg. 888, H. # 3211.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS also quotes the opinion of Ibn Hajar:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> The apostates were the people of Al-Nahrawan\u00a0(i.e. the\u00a0Khawarij) due to the establishment of the authentic report about them that \u201cThey will\u00a0apostasies\u00a0from the religion as the arrow leaves the bow.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Source:\u00a0Talkhis\u00a0Al-Habir\u00a0f\u012biAhadith\u00a0Raafi\u2019i Al-Kabir.

The word he uses is Al-Mariqeen \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0646: Those that cut through the religion like an arrow through its target. Al-Murooq, means to cut through something. RTS incorrectly translates the term Ramiyya as \u201cbow\u201d as well. (Al-Nihaya, p. 866, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1427, 4<sup>th<\/sup> edition)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the narration of the Messenger (pbuh) in which he orders the killing of the Mariqeen does not suggest that they are Kuffar. The death penalty is also applied to adulterers and those that commit homicide, and yet, they are considered Muslims as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truthfully, the narration of the Messenger (pbuh) is open to interpretation, and since it is, those that follow the school of Ahl Al-Sunnah return to the opinions of the companions regarding their status.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Musanaf Ibn Abi Shaybah 7\/562 we find that Ali was asked about the people of the river (Nahrawan):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649 \u0628\u0646 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0636\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0644\u0647\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0642\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u060c \u0641\u0633\u0626\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0631 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u061f \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u060c \u0642\u064a\u0644 : \u0641\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u061f \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u060c \u0642\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0647 : \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u061f \u0642\u0627\u0644 : \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0628\u063a\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 .<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are they Mushrik?
