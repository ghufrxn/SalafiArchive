These traditions are reported, as indeed are all Shi\u2018i traditions, on the authority of one of the Imams, in this case from Al-Baqir and Ja\u2018far. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">But were these Imams really the authors of such traditions, which describe their supernatural character? The first thing which must be noted in this connection is that while Al-Baqir and Ja\u2018far themselves lived in Medina, most of their followers lived in Kufa. This fact brings us to a crucial problem. Kufa had long been a centre ofghulat speculations and activities<\/span>. Whether \u2018Abd Allah bin Saba, to whom the history of theghulat is traced, was a real personality or not, the name as-Saba\u2019iyya is often used to describe the ghulat in Kufa who believed in the supernatural character of Ali.

And as we cannot tell the difference between both groups of narrations, I mean the fabricated ones and the ones issued by Taqqiyah and we have no way of making a distinction so how can we still work with the narrations of authentic chains with the possibility of them being from that group? Abandoning the authentic narrations of Ahlul-Bayt (ra) is definitely wrong as we cannot know their rulings except through these narrations , which is why we must return to our early Fuqahaa (scholars) as they have lots of evidence to make the distinction between the narrations, their knowledge proves that a narration is not from that group and if the chain is good then we work with it as a Hujjah, while others could have strong chains but since it is suspected of being from that group then it is dropped and abandoned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Qawa`ed al-Hadith page 135)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, after referring these two testimonies of esteemed Shia scholars , we came to know that, there existed Sabaites(Ghulat) in Kufa, They believed in supernatural character of Imams and they hated Abu Bakr(ra) and Umar(ra).

Because in this verse, Allah(swt) says that, The ones who said those derogatory words for Prophet(Saw) did that listening to Quran. Those words were not said by people, out of envy due to a person being made master or being given a high rank, rather the Quranic verse clearly shows that those words were said by disbelievers of Makkah, due to their listening to Glorious Quran. That is why the next verse of Quran says: The Quran is nothing but a reminder from God to mankind.( Quran 68:52, Shia translator Muhammad Sarwar).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But as we see, the narration used by RTS states, those derogatory words were said by people when Ali(ra) was made Master and when the Prophet(Saw) was turning his eyes. Whereas, the Quran states that the people said those words while listening to the Quran. The reason indicated by this Quranic verse for saying such derogatory words was that it was due to listening to the Quran, it has no similarity or resemblance or relation to the view that people said those derogatory words out of envy after seeing someone being made master. So the Quran contradicts the narration quoted by RTS which proves that it is not reliable. The ones mentioned are the disbelievers(Kuffar) of Makkah who would envy when they listened to the recitation, not the Muslims who increased in faith after listening.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us present the readers some Scholarly Commentaries of this verse (68:51) from both Shia and Sunni commentators to strengthen our view that those abusive words were the outcome of listening to the Quran:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.Shia tafseer of Pooya Ali:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When disbelievers found themselves helpless against the force of the Quran, in the intensity of their hatred, they looked at the Holy Prophet as if they would &#8220;eat him up&#8221; or trip him up, or disturb him from his position of stability. They used all sorts of terms of abuse in frustration-mad, possessed etcetera-but the true message of Allah prevailed, and it is made an eternal source of guidance to all mankind.(commentary for 68:51).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Shia Tafseer The Light of The Holy Qur\u2019an:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The closing Verses of the Chapter resumes the point mentioned in the opening of the Chapter regarding the false ascription of insanity to the Noble Prophet (SAW) by his enemies, saying the disbelievers would almost cause his death with their eyes upon hearing the Qur\u2019anic Verses and falsely claim that he is insane. The last blessed Verse of the Chapter is saying that this Qur\u2019an is but an awakening and a reminder to the worlds whose teachings and warnings are enlightening, its illustrations are meaningful, its encouragements and glad tidings are promising to the spirit and all in all it awakens the neglectful and reminds them of their obligations. How one may falsely claim that the Messenger of Allah is insane? The Arabic word dhikr denotes reminder as the Holy Qur\u2019an serves as a Reminder to all.

Some Qur\u2019an exegetes have entertained doubts about the Revelation of all the blessed Verses of the Chapter in Mecca, though the Chapter stands in total harmony with Meccan Chapters in terms of tone and content, since above all, it treats of the Noble Prophet\u2019s (SAW) Prophetic call and confrontation with the foes who regarded him as insane, call to patience and steadfastness, and warning the opponents against Divine torments. (The Light of The Holy Qur\u2019an by Ayatullah Sayyid Kamal Faghih Imani and A Group of Muslim Scholars, introducation of Surah 68).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allama Mawdoodi states in his tahfeem ul Quran:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Period of Revelation:This too is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at Makkah, but its subject matter shows that it was sent down at the time when opposition to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had grown very harsh and tyrannical.(Tahfeem ul Quran, , introduction of Surah 68).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, we find that Surah Al Qalam(68) was revealed in Makkah, however the fabricated narration used by RTS, talks about incident of Ghadeer and verse being revealed at that time, the incident of Ghadeer occurred many years after Prophet(Saw) migrated from Makkah. In other words, Surah Al Qalam was revealed many years before the incident of Ghadeer took place, which proves that the report used by RTS is a fabrication of Sabaites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Asbaab Al-Nuzool:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us look at the &#8216;Sabab Al-Nuzool&#8217; (&#8220;occasion\/circumstance of revelation&#8221;) of the Ayah to further strengthen the fact that (68:51) was revealed in regards to Disbelievers not for any companion of Prophet Muhammad(Saw).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Comment on verse 51 of Surah 68: Hence, [be patient] even though they who are bent on denying the truth would all but kill thee.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This verse was revealed when the disbelievers wanted to give the evil eye to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. Some people from the Quraysh looked once at him and said: \u201cWe have never seen anyone like him or like his proofs\u201d. The Banu Assad were renowned for their evil eye. A fat camel or cow would pass by one of them and, after giving it the evil eye, he would say to his slave-girl: \u201cO girl, take a large basket and a silver coin and bring us some of the meat of this!\u201d The camel or cow would fall dead straight after that and would then be hamstrung. Said al-Kalbi: \u201cThere was a man from the Arabs who used to abstain from food for two or three days and then raise part of his tent, upon the passing by of cattle, and say: \u2018There are no grazing camels or sheep today better than these\u2019, and the cattle would not proceed far before some of them would fall dead. The disbelievers requested this man to give the evil eye to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, but Allah, exalted is He, protected His Prophet and revealed this verse\u201d.( Asbaab Al-Nuzool&#8217; by Abu Al-Hassan Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ali Al-Wahidi).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we can see, the verse is clearly in regards to the Kuffar(disbelievers), it has no relation with the likes of Abu Bakr, Omar, Salim the Mawla of Abu Hudhayfa and Abu Ubaydah Ibn Al-Jarrah, all Badriyeen Sahaba (those who participated in the Badr battle).

That is why Umar(ra) during his Caliphate(let alone when he was not in authority), called Ali(ra) as his Mawla, as found in both Shia and Sunni books.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644: \u0642\u064a\u0644 (\u0644\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629) \u0639\u0645\u0631: \u0646\u0631\u0627\u0643 \u062a\u0635\u0646\u0639 \u0628\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0635\u0646\u0639\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645\u061f \u0641\u0642\u0627\u0644: \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a.<br \/>\n\u0648\u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0644: \u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629) \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0635\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0645\u0631: \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0642\u0636 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627. \u0641\u0642\u0636\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0647\u0645\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0636\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647: \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0636\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0646\u0627\u061f \u0641\u0648\u062b\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0641\u0623\u062e\u0630 \u0628\u062a\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0628\u0651\u0628\u0647\u060c \u062b\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644: \u0648\u064a\u062d\u0643 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627\u061f! \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646<br \/>\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u062f\u0631:<br \/>\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0631: \u0635 124 \u062c 40<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrated Salem: they said to caliph Umar: we see you treating Ali like you treat no other of the Companions of the Prophet PBUH? he said: He is my Mawla(friend).<br \/>\nImam al Baqir said: Once two wondering Arabs came to the caliph Umar so that he may Judge between them, So umar said to Ali: O Abu al Hassan why don\u2019t you Judge between them.

Wise and unbiased readers can realize that, here Umar(ra) didn\u2019t mean to say that Ali(ra) was his Master\/Caliph, if someone tries to argue then it will be stupidity, because why would Umar do so during his Caliphate? Umar(ra) was actually rebuking the Arab by saying that, Ali was close friend[Mawla] of Umar, that is why he treats Ali in a special manner. Importantly, why would Umar(ra) during his Caliphate call Ali(ra) his Mawla, if he had a problem when Prophet(Saw) called Ali(ra) as Mawla ? This shows that the report used by RTS is nothing but a fabrication of Sabaites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The fabrication of Sabaites used by RTS is Irrational:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The matn (Text) is a scenario full of hatred where Abu Bakr(ra), Umar(ra), the trustworthy of this Ummah, Abu Ubaydah Ibn Al-Jarrah and even Salim the Mawla (SERVANT) of Abu Hudhayfah are presented as enemies of the Prophet(saw)! The same people who were from the first and foremost believers, they accepted Islam when accepting Islam would put a person in all sorts of worldly problems, from persecution to social boycott and from torture to death. Yet, these people didn&#8217;t care about their lives, wealth or anything and accepted Islam and stood firm upon it. That is why several verses of Quran were revealed which praised the acts and beliefs of people among whom these Sahaba(ra) were included, such as Quran:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(8:72);(8:74);(48:29);(8:6263);(59:8);(9:20);(16:41);(48:29);(9:100);(4:115); (2:13);(48:18-19);(3:68);(9:88);(9:40), and many more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The same people, who risked their lives, their wealth, their property, suffered torture, boycott and left their land for Islam and Prophet Muhammad(saw), these people spoke such derogatory words for Prophet Muhammad(Saw) seeing Ali(ra) made a master, as the fabrication of Sabaites states, this is nonsensical, if one looks at it, from an unbiased and fair minded perspective. Importantly, Salim the servant of Abu Hudhayfah, who got freedom due to Islam and Prophet Muhammad(Saw) , who couldn&#8217;t even imagine of becoming a leader due to presence of some high ranking Muslims, why would He object Ali(ra) being made Master(if at all he was made) in such a derogatory manner? When we ponder over these facts in fair minded manner, we realize that, the report used by RTS is nothing but a fabrication of Sabaites, which is irrational and irrational.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The report used by RTS is a clear cut fabrication by the extremist Shia Sabaite sect which found its way to Shia books just like many others. When we apply the rule of analyzing the text of reports with Quran, we found that this report goes against the verse of Quran, which makes it useless. Also it goes against the apparent understanding of Quran, which we proved presenting commentaries of Shia and Sunni scholars. It even goes against the Asbaab Al Nuzool of the verse and the time period of revelation of the Surah Qalam. Moreover, it goes against another authentic hadeeth present in the same book Al Kafi.
