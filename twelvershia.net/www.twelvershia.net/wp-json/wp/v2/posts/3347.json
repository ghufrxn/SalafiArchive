The Shia don\u2019t even have any evidence that the verse is concerning `Al\u012b and his progeny, nor does it say that the chosen one needs to be in authority over the people. The prophet of the children of Isr\u0101\u2019\u012bl said regarding \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt as we find in the Qur\u2019an: {And their prophet said to them, &#8220;Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you\u201d} [2:247].<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt was not an infallible even though he was chosen. He was only a king and alongside him were two prophets (D\u0101w\u016bd and Sham\u016b\u012bl).<a href=\"#_ftn44\" name=\"_ftnref44\">[44]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>19- On pg.175 [To be with the Truthful \/ The Imams\u2019 Knowledge]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Even if Imam M\u0101lik bin Anas used to say: \u201cNo eye has seen, no ear has heard and no heart has thought of anybody better than Ja`far al-\u1e62\u0101diq in merit, knowledge, worship and piety.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: We do not deny Ja`far\u2019s virtue, his knowledge or his piety may Allah have mercy on him. However, we reject lies and exaggerations, Imam M\u0101lik may Allah have mercy on him never said those words. It is a lie and this sort of thing is expected of Tijani and his likes. We wish that Tijani found it sufficient to list the scholars who praised Imam Ja`far without lies and forgeries. Again, where is the authentic chain to Imam M\u0101lik?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mu\u1e63`ab said: M\u0101lik never narrated from Ja`far bin Muhammad unless he paired him to another from the big narrators and places him after them.<a href=\"#_ftn45\" name=\"_ftnref45\">[45]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>20- He wrote on pg.188 [To be with the Truthful \/ Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The honorable Companions have practiced Taqiyyah in the reign of tyrant rulers such as Mu`\u0101wiyah who killed anybody who refused to curse `Al\u012b bin abi \u1e6c\u0101lib.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: There are three matters:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, he claimed the Companions practiced Taqiyyah with Mu`\u0101wiyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, he claimed Mu`\u0101wiyah was an oppressor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thirdly, he claimed that Mu`\u0101wiyah killed anybody who refused to curse `Al\u012b.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of these are lies, fabrications and slander, which is nothing new.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the first: It is a lie and Tijani will not be able to provide one example. The best evidence exposing his lie is that the stance of al-A\u1e25naf bin Qays<a href=\"#_ftn46\" name=\"_ftnref46\">[46]<\/a>, Sa`d bin abi Waqq\u0101\u1e63<a href=\"#_ftn47\" name=\"_ftnref47\">[47]<\/a> among others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the second: If Mu`\u0101wiyah was an oppressor then how could al-\u1e24asan offer him authority over the entire nation, so he may torture them? In this case, all the blame falls on al-\u1e24asan bin `Al\u012b may Allah be pleased with him. Why would al-\u1e24usayn pledge an oath of allegiance to him if he was an oppressor!?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is that he wasn\u2019t an oppressor. He was from the best rulers and kings, may Allah have mercy on him. Though, he was not an infallible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the third: A pure lie, neither Tijani nor any Shia on the face of the planet who believes him, can bring forth one example of such a thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>21- On pg.196 [To be with the Truthful \/ Al-Mut`ah (or Temporary Marriage)]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>From Ibn `Abb\u0101s: \u201cThe Prophet did Mut`ah.\u201d But `Urwah said: Abu Bakr and `Umar forbade Mut`ah. Ibn `Abb\u0101s then said: \u201cWhat does little `Urwah say?\u201d He said: \u201cHe says that Abu Bakr and `Umar forbade it.\u201d So Ibn `Abb\u0101s said: \u201cThey will perish, I tell them about \u2018the Prophet said\u2019 and they reply with \u2018Abu Bakr and `Umar prohibited.\u2019\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: Tijani quoted this text as evidence for Mut`ah marriage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is from Tijani\u2019s deception, Ibn `Abb\u0101s and `Urwah were discussing the Mut`ah of Hajj not that of women. Shia themselves admit this since they say that Abu Bakr never forbade the Mut`ah of women, rather it was `Umar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The correct opinion is that the Mut`ah of women was forbidden by the Messenger (peace be upon him) as is reported in the \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25ayn from `Al\u012b bin abi \u1e6c\u0101lib: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade the meat of the domestic donkey and the Mut`ah of women on the day of Khaybar.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn48\" name=\"_ftnref48\">[48]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the Shia reported it from `Al\u012b in their books.<a href=\"#_ftn49\" name=\"_ftnref49\">[49]<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>22- Tijani wrote on pg.200 [To be with the Truthful \/ Claim of Tahrif of the Qur\u2019an]:<\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is attributed to the Shia, that they believe in the corruption of the Qur\u2019an, is no more than a means of intimidation and demonization without any basis in Shia beliefs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also said on that same page:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>I realized that it was only one of the fabricated vilifications aimed at causing people to have aversion to the Shia.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say: Do you see O\u2019 reader how shameless is Tijani and his likes, claiming that the entire accusation of corruption is no more than a way to vilify and intimidate the Shia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If al-Tijani was the least bit honest he would have said: Yes, many Shia scholars believed the Qur\u2019an is corrupt and some even spoke of a consensus such as H\u0101shim al-Bahr\u0101n\u012b. Others claimed it to be from the necessities of Shia faith like abu al-\u1e24asan al-Fat\u016bn\u012b, but we do not believe in this opinion nor do we believe that the Qur\u2019an is corrupt. Everybody who claims it is corrupt has disbelieved, their opinions are rejected, like al-Majlis\u012b, al-N\u016br\u012b, al-Kulayn\u012b, al-Qumm\u012b and the rest. If they had not repented then they\u2019re disbelievers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, what he wrote us is nothing more than a sly escape covered by lies.
