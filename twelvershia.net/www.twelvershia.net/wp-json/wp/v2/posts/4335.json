In this article, I will be applying the method of early hadith critics in analyzing both the chain and text of this report.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The study will be divided into three parts:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>A presentation of the report in question<\/li>\n<li>A study of its chain<\/li>\n<li>A study of its text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Presentation of Report<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The report in question was recorded by Ahmed in\u201d Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahabah,\u201d Ibn Abi Hatim in his Tafsir, Al-Wahidi in his \u201cAl-Wasit,\u201d and Al-Tabarani in his \u201cAl-Mu\u2019jam Al-Kabir,\u201d all of whom transmit it via Husayn Al-Ashqar, from Qays, from Al-A\u2019mash, from Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr, from Ibn \u2018Abbas, who said:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the verse \u201cI ask of you no reward (payment), except <em>mawaddah<\/em> (love\/kindness) for kinship,\u201d was revealed, the companions asked, \u201cWho are these kin whom we are obligated to love?\u201d The Prophet replied, \u201c\u2018Ali, Fatimah, and their two sons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chain Analysis<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As preceded, the report originates from Husayn Al-Ashqar, from Qays, from Al-A\u2019mash, from Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr, from Ibn \u2018Abbas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To begin, Husyan Al-Ashqar isn\u2019t considered reliable.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Abu Hatim Al-Razi says, \u201cHe isn\u2019t strong in hadith.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Abu Zur\u2019ah says, \u201cHe is an objectionable transmitter.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Al-Nassa\u2019i says, \u201cHe isn\u2019t strong.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Al-Daraqutni says, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t strong.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It appears as though some accused him of intentional hadith fabrication, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. In fact, Ahmed bin Hanbal said, \u201cIn my opinion, he didn\u2019t used to fabricate hadith.\u201d In conclusion, though he isn\u2019t reliable, he didn\u2019t forge hadith. \u00a0It should also be noted that Ibn Hajar counted Husayn as an extreme Shi\u2019i.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Qays, in the report, is Qays bin Rabi\u2019 Al-Asadi. Even though he was an honest and trustworthy transmitter, he too isn\u2019t reliable.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Abu Zur\u2019ah said, \u201cWeak.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Abu Hatim, \u201cHis reports are written, but not relied upon.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Al-Nassa\u2019i said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t reliable.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Others, like Ibn \u2018Adiyy have a better opinion of him, but the majority of hadith critics agree that Qays isn\u2019t reliable, as preceded.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-A\u2019mash, of course, is a Hafiz, and all agree upon his reliability and accuracy. He is known as a prolific transmitter, transmitting a large number of reports, and was \u201clucky\u201d enough to have many regular students transmitting from him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr, the famous student of Ibn \u2018Abbas is also reliable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hadith critics apply a principle in certain scenarios that potentially indicate that a serious mistake occurred in transmission. In essence, not all reliable hadith transmitters are of the same level. Variation occurs in both, the quantity of transmission, as well as the number of students they have.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, it becomes problematic when an average transmitter exclusively narrates from a reliable transmitter who is known for their great quantity or sheer number of transmitted reports, especially when the latter would have a considerable number of students who regularly attend his sessions. That problem is compounded when the transmitter is considered unreliable. A Muhaddith would become skeptical of the situation and ask themselves, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the other students transmit the same report? Where are the reliable transmitters who habitually attended his sessions for years?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our situation, Husayn bin Al-Ashqar, an unreliable transmitter, transmits from Qays bin Al-Rabi\u2019, another unreliable transmitter, who then exclusively transmits from Al-A\u2019mash, a report that isn\u2019t found amongst any of the reliable or even <em>unreliable <\/em>students of Al-A\u2019mash. There is no other way to explain this, other than a serious error has occurred in the transmission of this hadith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Textual Analysis<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problems with this report don\u2019t end with the issues found in the chain of transmission. Indeed, there are problems in the content that further indicate the occurrence of an error.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Firstly<\/strong>, it is authentically established from Ibn \u2018Abbas that he explained the verse in question, in a different manner. Had he really transmitted the alleged prophetic interpretation of the verse, how would he allow himself to give a contradictory interpretation?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tawus reported that Sa\u2019id ibn Jubayr explained the verse to refer to the household of the Prophet. Ibn \u2018Abbas corrected him saying, \u201cYou have been hasty. There is no branch of Quraysh, except that the Prophet had relatives from.\u201d He went to interpret the verse as, \u201cExcept for you to keep the ties due to what is between us of kinship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is recorded by Al-Bukhari in his \u201cSahih,\u201d Al-Tirmidhi in his \u201cJami\u2019,\u201d Ibn Hibban in his \u201cSahih,\u201d Ibn Jarir in his tafsir, Al-Hakim his \u201cAl-Mustadrak,\u201d Al-Wahidi in his \u201cAl-Wasit,\u201d as well as others, all of whom transmit via Shu\u2019bah bin Al-Hajjaj, from Abdul-Malik bin Maysarah, from Tawus, from Ibn \u2018Abbas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is another authentic and independent chain from Ibn \u2018Abbas that came as a result of Al-Sha\u2019bi\u2019s question to him about the verse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is recorded by Ibn Sa\u2019d in his \u201cAl-Tabaqat,\u201d Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir, Al-Bayhaqi in his \u201cAl-Dala\u2019il,\u201d all of whom transmit from Dawud bin Abi Hind, from Al-Sha\u2019bi, from Ibn \u2018Abbas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both of these chains are obviously authentic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is further transmitted via the famous tafsir chains from Ibn \u2018Abbas that are mentioned by Ibn Jarir, and others in their Tafasir. And though the reliability of these famous tafsir chains are usually debated, the fact that we have the two independently authentic chains lends credence to their veracity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Secondly<\/strong>, it is authentically established from some of Ibn \u2018Abbas\u2019s own students that they gave interpretations of the verse, contradictory to the alleged prophetic interpretation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, \u2018Ikrimah, as recorded by Ibn Sa\u2019d in his \u201cAl-Tabaqat,\u201d interprets it in a similar way that Ibn \u2018Abbas did. After explaining that there wasn\u2019t a branch of Quraysh that the Prophet wasn\u2019t related to, he explains the verse as meaning, \u201cIf you don\u2019t protect me by virtue of what I was sent with, at least protect me by virtue of the kinship that exists between us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is further transmitted from Mujahid, another student of Ibn \u2018Abbas, though the chain to him, may be problematic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Thirdly<\/strong>, the very occasion for Ibn \u2018Abbas\u2019 interpretation was to clear up the misconception that would later be propagated by the hadith in question. \u00a0This is indicated by Al-Sha\u2019bi\u2019s transmission from Ibn \u2018Abbas which preceded. Al-Sha\u2019bi wrote to Ibn \u2018Abbas after a controversy on the meaning of the verse ensued. Furthermore, Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr seems to have fallen for the misconception and Ibn \u2018Abbas had to clear it up for him as well, telling him, \u201cYou have been hasty.\u201d Since he is clearing up what he considered to be a misconception, he couldn\u2019t have possible transmitted the very report which would lend credence to the very misconception he is refuting!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fourthly<\/strong>, the context of the verses in the Qur\u2019an, as well as its historical context support Ibn \u2018Abbas\u2019 explanation. The context of the verse suggests an exchange between the Prophet and the Mushrikin, wherein he would plead with them, for their own sake, to keep the ties of kinship between them and him. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that the Prophet would be telling the mushrikin to show love and kindness, specifically to the family of his daughter, which had yet to exist. Ibn Kathir comments, \u201cIt [the surah] is Makki, and at that time Fatimah had no children, as she did not marry \u2018Ali until after the battle of badr, in the second year after hijrah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we take in all the factors mentioned about both, the chain, and its text, it becomes clear that this hadith is baseless. The question that asks itself is, \u201cWhat, then, is the origin of this hadith? Where did the error come from?\u201d After all, the report has to have come from somewhere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we don\u2019t assume malicious intent in the forging of the hadith, I think it is safe to say that it probably started as an opinion of Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr, and as it was passed down, it eventually was attributed to the Prophet, and since Sa\u2019id was a well-known student of Ibn \u2018Abbas, it was attributed to the Prophet through him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Someone may say, \u201cWell, this sounds like a fancy theory, but what evidence supports it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For one, we know that Sa\u2019id bin Jubayr held the opinion that they verse was referring to the household of the Prophet. It is reported as such in the Sahih Al-Bukhari account that preceded, wherein Ibn \u2018Abbas corrected him. It is also reported through another chain of transmission from him in Al-Tabari\u2019s Tafsir. This shows that there is basis for Sa\u2019id\u2019s presence in the chain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sa\u2019id\u2019s never stated that they household of the Prophet that he was referring to were only Fatimah, \u2018Ali, and their two sons. How did, \u201chousehold of the Prophet,\u201d change to \u201cFatimah, \u2018Ali, and their two sons?\u201d I theorize that when Qays passed down the report (already incorrectly attributed to the Prophet) to Husayn Al-Ashqar, Husayn felt the liberty to paraphrase the hadith, as some transmitters do. Being the Shi\u2019I that he was, he paraphrased, \u201chousehold of the Prophet,\u201d in a way that a Shi\u2019i would understand it: Fatimah, \u2018Ali, and her two sons. In essence, it was a rephrasing of the report, in an explanatory manner, as understood by the Shi\u2019i transmitter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Written by Abdullah Moataz<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Introduction The report we shall study in this article is an alleged prophetic explanation of a verse in the Qur\u2019an, that has been appealed to by some Shi\u2019a.
