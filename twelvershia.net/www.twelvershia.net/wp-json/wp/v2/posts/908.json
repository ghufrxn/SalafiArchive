Ghadir786 argues that the most common position is that scholars have accepted the narrations of innovators which are in support of their innovation. They then include a list of scholars that held this view. The list includes Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Al-Tirmithi, Al-Nasa\u2019ee, Ibn Majah, Al-Hakim, Al-Bayhaqi, and Al-Dhahabi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Ghadir786 did not provide any references that this is the opinion of these scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best they could do is quote Al-Turaifi, which mentioned the names of those scholars, and more, and stated that they all quoted the Hadith of `Ali that \u201cNobody loves me except for a believer, and nobody hates me except for a disbeliever,\u201d and that this narration only comes through the path of Adi bin Thabit (reliable narrator described as being Shia).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet, this argument of his is still problematic since the scholars in that list, with the exception of Imam Muslim and Ibn Hibban, did not write their books with the intention of only quoting authentic Hadiths. So, it is quite possible that those same scholars recorded this Hadith while believing that it is weak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, there were those that have weakened this narration, like Al-Daraqutni in Al-Ilzamaat wal Tatabu`, apparently for the very fact that it is only narrated by a Shi`ee.

Firstly, we are in agreement that Ja\u2019afar bin Sulaiman narrating from Yazeed. There is no accusation here that he didn\u2019t. The argument is that Ja\u2019afar bin Sulaiman did not literally narrate what he heard, but narrated the meaning of what he heard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSome companions have narrated that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said that Islam is: \u201cthe five prayers, the zakat, the hajj, and the fasting of Ramadhan.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Others have narrated the same Hadith, but they said: \u201cthe five prayers, the zakat, the fasting of Ramadhan, and the hajj.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Due to the permissibility of narrating a Hadith according to the meaning, and not in literal form, or not &#8220;word for word&#8221;, we have ended up with two versions of the same Hadith being attributed to the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam). Yet, both are referred to as \u201cHadith Jibreel,\u201d and are therefore the same Hadith.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In most cases, such a thing is harmless. However, it can be can in some cases be harmful, the understanding of individuals may change the meaning of a Hadith. In this case, Ja`afar bin Sulaiman heard from Yazeed the same popular narration, but heard him say, \u201c`Ali is the Mawla of every believer.\u201d Yet, due to the Tashayyu of Ja`afar bin Sulaiman, he understood that Mawla in this narration means master, and that it wouldn&#8217;t make sense that `Ali is the current master of the believers, since the Prophet (saw) was alive and there can&#8217;t be two leaders at the same time. So, he understood that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) meant that this is the case after his death. Due to this, if one narrated the narration as \u201cMawla of every believer AFTER ME\u201d, they would not be lying, but they are simply narrating the narration in the way that they understood it as Shia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, there is no need for proof that Ja`afar bin Sulaiman heard this narration from Al-Ajlah, since Ja`afar bin Sulaiman\u2019s narration is rejected either way due to his Tashayyu. The suggestion that he MAY have heard it from Al-Ajlah, or any Shi`ee, or simply related it from his understanding, are simply possibilities. This is a common practice that we find in the actions of Hadith scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4- Abu Balj\u2019s Narration:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After providing opinions of early Hadith experts that the narration of Abu Balj is weak in our original article, Ghadir786 responds with the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">On what basis did Ahmad question the narration? There is none! &#8216;Abd al-Ghaniyy al-\u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 too who claimed that Ab\u016b Balj made a mistake, where is his evidence? Once more, there is none! We wonder how our brother, Farid, thinks such kinds of unsupported statements can constitute evidence in any circumstance!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The early scholars of Hadith are like jewellers. One would go to a jeweller and present him with a jewel and he would say it is a fake. You too would not know how they have arrived at such a conclusion, but this was due to their experience and expertise in the field. Similarly, the early Hadithists spent their lives studying Hadith and have attained the levels that they rose to only after they have delved so deeply into the science.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia science of Hadith is loaded with vagueness, guesswork, conjecture and inaccuracies, we can easily turn the table on the Shia and say:\u00a0I can ask our friends at Ghadir786, why do you accept that Muhammad bin Eisa\u2019s narration from Yunus is weak, or that Muhammad bin Eisa Al-Ash`ari is reliable, or that Al-Hasan bin Mahboub never met Abu Hamza Al-Tham`ali, when all you have are those words and no explanation from your early scholars like Al-Tusi and Al-Najashi? If all you can provide are assumptions without proof, then we suggest that you either accept our reliance on our expert Sunni scholars, or simply switch to being Hadith-rejectors or become Akhbaris.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The folks at Ghadir786 continue by providing narrations that Abu Balj narrated from Amr bin Maymoon in an attempt to show that this was not a mistake by him. However, anyone with experience in the field of Hadith sciences is aware that mistakes like these occur. One can even make a mistake when attributing a Hadith to two people with completely different names, let alone those with a similar one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ghadir786 continues:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Of course, there are many other similar examples. But, we are stopping here. It is strange. Isn&#8217;t it? Ab\u016b Balj was repeatedly stating the wrong name while narrating from &#8216;Amr b. Maym\u016bn???!! Or, he only did that when he narrated about the merits of Am\u012br al-M\u016bmin\u012bn &#8216;Al\u012b b. Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib. Right?!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The statements of the big scholars have their weight and importance, on the other hand the doubts that are cast by a contemporary Shi\u2019ee online have none.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe evidence that this narration is that of Maymoon Abu Abdullah is that he too is a narrator of this Hadith. (See Al-Kamil by Ibn `Adi). Furthermore, we have stated previously that `Amr bin Maymoon doesn&#8217;t narrate from Ibn `Abbas. Both of these are enough reason to raise suspicion, yet, as we said previously, these possibilities are not necessary for the statements of scholars were enough.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5- The Probability Argument:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ghadir786 finally comes up with a good argument. They suggest that since the version of \u201cevery believer AFTER ME\u201d exists in the reports of three Sahabis, then it is more likely to be true:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">First, he heaps the blame of everything upon his scapegoat, al-Ajla\u1e25. However, he seems to have forgotten that both Ja&#8217;far b. Sulaym\u0101n and Ab\u016b Balj have equally transmitted the same \u1e25ad\u012bth with the same addition through \u1e63a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 chains! Besides, the version without the addition is narrated by Buraydah only, while that with the addition is narrated by &#8216;Imr\u0101n b. \u1e24a\u1e63\u012bn, Ibn &#8216;Abb\u0101s and Buraydah himself! Isn&#8217;t logical that the stronger version is that narrated by multiple \u1e62a\u1e25\u0101bah, through multiple reliable chains?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, we have to remind the good people at Ghadir786 that this is not a case of the narration of Buraidah vs the narrations of Imran, Ibn Abbas, and Buraidah (3 versus 1), but rather, it is two versus one, since we have provided through multiple authentic chains that Buraidah did not include the addition. It is simply absurd to still suggest that Buraidah\u2019s narration with the inclusion of \u201cAfter Me\u201d is the correct one when the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, one of the narrations of Buraidah, comes through the path of Ibn Abbas through an extremely authentic chain. The chain is much stronger than the narration of Abu Balj, since it is from the narration Abdulm`Alik bin Humayyid from Al-Hakam from Sa\u2019eed bin Jubair from Ibn Abbas, and there is no doubt that this Saheeh chain is stronger than Abu Balj\u2019s chain, which is weak. Moreover, even those that strengthened Abu Balj\u2019s chain only called it \u201cHasan\u201d, and a Saheeh Hadith is stronger than a \u201cHasan\u201d one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I add, that the Hadith is also authentic from the Hadith of `Ali ibn abi Talib in Fadha\u2019il Al-Sahaba #986, without the addition of \u201cAfter Me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, we have an authentic Hadith from Sunan Al-Tirmithi #3646 in which Abu Al-Tufail narrates this Hadith from Abu Sareeha or Zaid bin Arqam (Shu\u2019ba was not sure which of the two) that the Prophet (salalahu alaihi wa salam) said the same thing, without the addition of \u201cAfter Me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, this narration is authentic (Sahih) from the narration of `Ali, Buraidah, Zaid bin Arqam\/Abu Sareeha, and Ibn Abbas (four narrations), without the addition of \u201cAfter Me\u201d, versus the weak narration via Imran bin Husain (one narration). Praise be to God, &#8220;probability&#8221; is also on our side.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, the addition of \u201cAfter Me\u201d is not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We Ahlul-Sunnah believe in the authentic and popular text of Hadith Ghadeer Khumm, The Hadith that says &#8220;Whoever considers me his Mawla, `Ali is also his Mawla&#8221;, as for altered and corrupted versions of this text, we reject them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response by Farid to the article on the Ghadir786 website, which was entitled: Farid and the Hadith Al-Wilayah, which can be found here.
