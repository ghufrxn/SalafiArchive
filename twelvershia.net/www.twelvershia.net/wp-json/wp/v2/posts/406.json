Needless to say that the Rafidha scholars jumped on the wagon and (in contrary to their forefathers) suddenly claimed that Ibn Saba\u2019 is actually a myth created by the evil Umayyads to tarnish the reputation of the Shias (a claim by the likes of Murtadha Al-\u2019Askari, Muhammad Aal Kashif Al-Ghita etc.). Prior to 1300H (1900CE) there was no dispute about this matter at all. The contemporary Shia found in the writings of those Orientalists what was the delight of the eye and thus they began authoring in order to cast doubt about the existence of\u00a0Abdullah bin Saba\u2019, as this would allow them to dismiss a large part of the criticism against them and their sect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The contemporary Shia scholars \u00a0have written books in regards to this topic, the most famous (nearly on every Rafidhi propaganda website) one might be the apologetic work of \u2018Ayatollah\u2019 Murtadha Al-\u2019Askari named:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cABDUL-AH IBN SABA AND OTHER\u00a0MYTHS\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/abdullah-ibn-saba-other-myths.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-407\" src=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/abdullah-ibn-saba-other-myths-205x300.jpg\" alt=\"abdullah-ibn-saba-other-myths\" width=\"205\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/abdullah-ibn-saba-other-myths-205x300.jpg 205w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/abdullah-ibn-saba-other-myths.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of course his book has been refuted (academically) by a number of scholars, such as:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saaid.net\/bahoth\/43.htm\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Dr. Sami Ataa\u2019 Hassan \u2013 \u201c\u2018Abdallah Ibn Saba the Yemenite Jew, between reality and imagination\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sadly none of the books that refute the above Shia book were translated to other languages.

In fact this is a myth (an actual myth) propagated by the contemporary Shias around the world. Let us take for example of the most infamous Shia propaganda websites on the net, namely &#8220;al-Islam.org&#8221; which says (in the online version of Murtadha Al-Askari\u2019s \u201cIbn Saba\u2019 and other myths\u201d):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fabricated stories around the character of Abdullah Ibn Saba are the malicious production of one of the disciples of the devil, namely Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ibn Saba did not exist at that time, not even in the imagination of Saif Ibn Umar al-Tamimi who invented this character.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for those few traditions which have the chain of narrators (independent of Sayf), they provide a much different story which do not support any of the allegations of Sayf. These traditions picture an accursed man whom Ahlul-Bayt have declared their innocence from what he attributed to Imam Ali (declaring Ali as God). The Shia, their Imams and their scholars declare the curse of Allah to that man (if ever existed) he was lost, misguided and cursed. There is nothing in common between us [Shias] and his name except our curse on him and all other extremists who believed in deity of Ahlul-Bayt.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Let us break down the major claims of those Shia who completely deny the existence of Ibn Saba\u2019, as their \u2018Ayatollah\u2019 Al-\u2019Askari did:<\/p>\n<p>A)<strong>\u00a0As for those \u2018few\u2019 traditions which have the chain of narrators independent of Sayf, they do not support any of the allegations of Sayf, hence there is nothing in common between the Shia beliefs and the personality of Ibn Saba\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>B)\u00a0<strong>Sayf Ibn Umar al-Tamimi invented the character of Ibn Saba&#8217;

return all strenghten the narrations of Sayf Ibn Omar. There is no doubt that Sabaite beliefs have been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt and the prove according to Sunni narrations are the facts stating in the narrations above, let us make a summary:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Sabaism:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0Ali held grudge against his fellow Sahaba, particularly Abu Bakr and Omar. He ascribed this belief of Ali and his excuse was that he is merely doing it out of \u2018love for the Ahl Al-Bayt and hatred towards their enemies\u2019 (Tawalli and Tabari).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Rafidhi Shiism:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0Rafdh (rejectionism) represented by countless sects (today\u2019s mostly made up by Twelver Shias) is the only sect that propagates the very same Sabaite belief that Ali held grudge against Abu Bakr and Omar and the Sahaba, Ali hated them and they were the enemies of the Ahl Al-Bayt and it is a sign of love to hate them (Sahaba) since they were Ali\u2019s enemies.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Reality (Islam):<\/span>\u00a0<\/strong>Ali did not just reject those beliefs attributed to him, he in fact seeked refuge in Allah and was about to execute Ibn Saba\u2019 for propagating such beliefs in his (Ali\u2019s name) and \u00a0under the excuse of \u2018loving the Ahl Al-Bayt and hating their enemies\u2019. He deported Ibn Saba\u2019 and threatened everyone who prefers him (Ali) over Abu Bakr and Omar with lashes as they do with the slandering liar.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the claim that there is \u201cnothing in common\u201d between Shias (Rafidha who by defenition are REJECTORS of the absolute majority of the Sahaba) and the beliefs propagated by Ibn Saba\u2019 and reported by Sayf Ibn Omar (AND others \u2026) is plain and simply not true, in fact Rafdhi Shiism throughout history always propagated the Sabaite belief that Ali hated Abu Bakr and Omar and the Sahaba. So there is a link between Ibn Saba\u2019s \u00a0lie and what the Rafidha have wrongly ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt. This is why Sunni scholars rightly state that:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>The foundation of Al-Rafd is taken from the Jews<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We need to be precise about our words and thus we believe that slogans like \u201cShiism was created by a Jew\u201d are not accurate (enough), for\u00a0\u00a0there is no unified monolithic \u201cShiaism\u201d, in fact Shiism (Tashayyu\u2019) had different meanings throughout Islamic history:<\/p>\n<p>Al-Dhahabi says: \u201cThe Ghaali (extremist) Shiite in the time of the Salaf (first three Muslims generations) and according to them is those that speak against Othman, Al-Zubair, Talha, Mu\u2019awiyah, and those that fought Ali (RA), and attacked them\u201d.

I can show you bios of shia narrators, there are shias of fist generation in Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad.\u00a0 So, Ahmad ibn Hanbal died in 241 h, and this hadith (about Ashara al-Mubashara) was recorded long time before his death.<br \/>\nSo, before shias distinguished from ahlesunnah, (before) they made themselves as independent school, (before) they took idea that they believe in, as a (major) point of their movement, these ahadeth (about companions which were gladden by paradise) took their place in books.\u00a0 Did in that time were shias like these, so (someone could claim) that this hadith (about Ashara al-Mubashara) was fabricated (in attempt) to\u00a0 protect (companions) from their charges?\u00a0 So issue of takfir of muteahirin shias didn\u2019t present in the time of mutakadimin.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Shia in the past were by no means like the Twelvers today, yet nevertheless they were considered extremists (so what would the likes of Ibn Hajar and Al-Dhahabi call the Rafidha of today?!) for simply propagating and holding the belief that Ali is superior to Abu Bakr and Omar (a nonsense belief, for Mutawatir narrations prove without a shadow of a doubt that Ali believed in the superiority of Abu Bakr and Omar over himself). Shiism in its evolution reached the peak and propagated what Shias propagate to this very day namely that it was part of Ali\u2019s belief that Abu Bakr and Omar are his enemies, so were the Sahaba and everyone else who rejected Ali as their so called him. Shiism today is propagated what Ibn Saba\u2019 claimed and what Ali rejected, and based on that Ibn Saba\u2019 is the spiritual father of Rafidhism and not that he literally created each and every aspect of the Shia sect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rhetorical slips and a tendency not to be exact in our words is something that the enemies of the Ahl Al-Sunnah do take advantage of but every sane person should understand what is meant with the statement above and the message of this article which is that the foundation of Shiism (like Takfeer of the Sahaba, particularly Abu Bakr and Omar) is not a belief of the Ahl Al-Bayt, rather a Jewish belief that has been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt by a Yemenite Jew.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the Shia MYTH has been debunked, namely that the personality of Ibn Saba\u2019 was invented by the Umayyad Sayf Ibn Omar and narrated by him only, let us also provide you with some additional information, InshaAllah.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>al-islam org (citing Al-\u2019Askari\u2019s) book claim:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It appears that al-Tabari was the first who reported the story of Ibn Saba from Sayf, and then other historians quoted al-Tabari in this regard.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Al-\u2019Askari and Shia propagandists are wrong (again) for over fifty years before Al-Tabari, namely by\u00a0Al-Thakafi who wrote the book \u201cAl Gharat\u201d, Ibn Saba\u2019 was also mentioned:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0648\u062d\u062c\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u064a \u0648\u062d\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0641\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0631\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0648\u0631<strong>\u00a0\u0648\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0623<\/strong>\u00a0\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646\u2026 \u2013 \u00a0\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0635302<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAmro bin Al-amd, Hajar bin Uday, Habbah Al-Awfy, Al-Harith Al-A\u2019awar and\u00a0<strong>Abdullah Ibn Saba\u2019<\/strong>\u00a0all entered on the Chief of the Believers (Ali) \u2026\u201d (Al-Gharat 302).<\/p>\n<p>Besides,\u00a0<strong>the oldest<\/strong>\u00a0reference to the term \u201cSabaite\u201d is Diwan Ashi Hamdan , p. 147.

This was the first sect of this Ummah that spoke of (the position of) al-waqf (withholding) after the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam),<strong>\u00a0and the first of them that spoke with exaggeration (al-ghuluww)<\/strong>, and<strong>\u00a0this sect is called the Sab\u2019iyyah, the associates of\u00a0Abdullah bin Saba\u2019, and he used to display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othmaan and the Companions and would free himself from them.<\/strong>\u00a0And<strong>\u00a0he said<\/strong>\u00a0that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so.

Will you kill a man\u00a0<strong>who calls to love of the Ahl al-Bayt, to your loyalty and disassociation from your enemies?<\/strong>\u201d So instead, he exiled him to al-Madaa\u2019in.\u00a0<strong>A group from the people of knowledge<\/strong><strong>from the associates of Ali (alayhis-salaam)<\/strong>\u00a0judged that\u00a0Abdullah bin Saba\u2019\u00a0was a Jew who then became Muslim and showed loyalty to Ali (alayhis salaam) and whilst he was a Jew he used to say the same of Joshua bin Nun after Moses (alayhis salaam) [as he said about Ali], and in his Islam, he (Ibn Saba\u2019) would say the same of Ali (alayhis salaam) after the death of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), with what is similar to that (what he used to say as a Jew).<strong>\u00a0He was also the first to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali (alayhis salaam)<\/strong>, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers. It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, \u201c<strong>The foundation of al-Rafd is taken from the Jews<\/strong>.\u201d When Abdullah bin Saba and his companions heard the announcement of Ali\u2019s death whilst they were in al-Madaa\u2019in, he said to the one who announced it, \u201cYou have lied O enemy of Allaah. Even if you came with Ali\u2019s brain in seventy bundles, and you tasked seventy just men to kill him, we would not believe you due to our knowledge that he has not died and was not killed and that he will not die unti he drives the Arabs forth with his staff and dominates the earth.\u201d From that day, he and his associates travelled until they came to the door (of the house of) Ali.

According to these apologetics Ibn Saba is a guy who has been\u00a0cursed, by the Imams, merely because he tried to preach to the people the\u00a0divinity\u00a0of Ali, and not\u00a0the Imamah of Ali.<\/p>\n<p>What these people overlook or try to blur out is the fact that Shia scholars did not only confirm that Ibn Saba\u2019 teached to the people the divinity of Ali, rather<strong>\u00a0he was also the first to preach two essential basics<\/strong>\u00a0which are only to be found in the creed of the Rafidha:<\/p>\n<p>1)\u00a0<strong>Ibn Saba was the first to\u00a0display revilement of Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and the Companions and would free himself from them.<\/strong>\u00a0And<strong>\u00a0he said<\/strong>\u00a0that Ali (alayhis-salaam) commanded him to do so (just as the Rafidha today claim). Ali wanted to KILL him for that (!) only due to the protests of the people he expelled him instead i.e.(punished him nevertheless). This has been confirmed by Al-Naubakhti, Al-Kashi and (Saad Ibn Abdallah) Al-Qummi.<\/p>\n<p>2)\u00a0<strong>Ibn Saba\u2019\u00a0was also the first\u00a0to witness with the saying of the obligation of the leadership (imaamah) of Ali<\/strong>, and he openly announced his disavowal of his enemies and declared them disbelievers (Takfeer Al-Sahaba). This is another admission by Shia scholars (not \u2018Umayyads\u2019) that cannot be dismissed that easily.<\/p>\n<p>It is from here that whoever opposed the Shia said, \u201c<strong>The foundation of Al-Rafd is taken from the Jews<\/strong>.\u201d and this is what the Muslims believe and the Ahl Al-Sunnah declare and within this precise slogan lies the answer to the sheer stupidty of Rafidhi propagators who ask questions such as:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat\u00a0\u00a0Shia Usool can be traced back to Ibn Saba\u2019?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat Fiqh ruling?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhich of our Imams praised Ibn Saba\u2019\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHow many Ahadith did we take from Ibn Saba\u2019\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cAre the Shia so stupid and ignorant that after 1400 years, they<\/em><br \/>\n<em>have never figured out that their belief and faith are based on fabricated<\/em><br \/>\n<em>traditions and tales going back to Abdullah Ibn Saba?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIf Abdullah Ibn Saba is such an influential and important figure for the<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Shia, how come they NEVER quote him like they do with the Imams of Ahlul<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Bayt?

Heck, the Christ-Worshippers to this very day don\u2019t realise or won\u2019t accept the founder of their sect was Saulus the pagan and not Jesus (peace be upon him), they really think they are Shias (followers\/believers in) of Jesus. So what is meant by \u2018Shiism was created by a Jew\u2019 is that Shiism (not in the political sense, for many Sahaba where followers of Ali but certainly not Rafidha in creed) as a creed, particularly in regards to the Takfeer of the Sahaba (especially Shaykhayn i.e. Abu Bakr and Omar) and the claim\u00a0of the obligation of the leadership (Imamat) of Ali (and the Ghuluw with him) is not the Madhab of the Ahl Al-Bayt, rather the Madhab of Ibn Saba\u2019 the Jew who laid down these very foundations, he was the first \u00a0to propagate those beliefs, hence it has been said and will be always said that:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Ibn Saba\u2019 is the spiritual father of the Rafidha, for he laid down foundations that can be found in no sect, except the Rafidhi sect (in his many offshoots such as the Twelvers today).<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many of those that have said that he is the created of Shiasm are referring to his views on Takfeer of the Sahaba, R<em>aja\u2019ah\u00a0<\/em>and his G<em>huluw (extremism)\u00a0<\/em>for Ali, and that he was famous for holding these views. Perhaps to the extent that one would have a hard time finding someone who shared such views before him.However, if one is going to argue that Ibn\u00a0Saba\u2019a literally \u201ccreated\u201d Shiasm with all its foundations including Imamah and what not, then no, there is no such thing and nobody made that claim amongst the scholars, the whole point is that Ibn Saba\u2019 laid down the foundations of Rafidhism which had been ascribed to the Ahl Al-Bayt, to this very day by the Twelver sects (foundations such as Takfeer of the Sahaba, Abu Bakr and Omar etc).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>CONCLUSION:<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Muslim scholars actually believe that his ideas are responsible<strong>\u00a0for the evolution of Shiism<\/strong>, but not that he was Shiism actual founder (for Rafidi Shi\u2019ism changed during centuries). You will find in Tareekh Dimashq a few more reports on Ibn\u00a0Saba\u2019 glorifying Ali and referring to him as a creator. Al-Jawzajani (d. 259 AH) in his book of\u00a0<em>rijal<\/em>\u00a0also refers to Ibn\u00a0Saba\u2019 and states that he said that we only have 1\/9 of the Qur\u2019an, and the rest is with Ali\u2026 and over time, that perhaps turned into the view of T<em>ahreef<\/em>. The bottom line is we do see some of what Ibn Saba\u2019 propagate in the name of the Ahl Al-Bayt come in the same form under what we know today as Shiism and is been proagated by Shiism in the name of the Ahl Al-Bayt.<\/span><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Article written by one of the brothers at the famous &#8220;gift2shias.com&#8221; about the origins of the Imami Shi`ah movement, he asked us to post his article here. &nbsp; This is a\u00a0lengthy article divided into three parts. 1.\u00a0New phenomena: Outright rejection <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/2013\/05\/30\/ibn-saba-the-jew-the-spiritual-father-of-the-rafidha-an-unquestionable-truth\/\" title=\"Ibn Saba\u2019 The Jew, The Spiritual Father Of the Rafidha \u2013 An Unquestionable Truth\">[read more]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3845,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11,8],"tags":[],"class_list":{"0":"post-406","1":"post","2":"type-post","3":"status-publish","4":"format-standard","5":"has-post-thumbnail","7":"category-articles","8":"category-taqiyyah"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/406","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=406"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/406\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2762,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/406\/revisions\/2762"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3845"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=406"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=406"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=406"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
