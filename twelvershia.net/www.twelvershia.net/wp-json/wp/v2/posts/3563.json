Even though this is a general argument brought up against Islam by non-Muslims, it has become popular ammo for modern Shias. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Generally, Shias use this narration in order to attack Al-Bukhari himself and to attack the Sunni system of hadith gradings. Shias also use this hadith to suggest that Sunnis are irrational and gullible. We shall respond to these accusations below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">The article will be taking a look at the following topics:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; The Event of the Adulterous Monkeys<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; Did Al-Bukhari Fabricate this Narration?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; Is this a Prophetic Narration?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; Are Sunnis Gullible for Believing in this Narration?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; The Dilemma and <\/span><strong><span class=\"tm6\">Hypocrisy<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"tm7\"> of Shia Polemicists<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">&#8211; Conclusion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">The Event of the Adulterous Monkeys<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Most of those that are already here are familiar with the event, however, a quick recap is in order for the sake of clarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Al-Bukhari narrates #3849 that Amr bin Maymoun said: In pre-Islamic times, I saw monkeys that gathered upon monkeys who fornicated. They began to stone them, so I stoned them as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">The narration is extremely short and does not contain any details. A detailed version can be found in Ma\u2019rifat Al-Sahaba by Abi Nu\u2019aym 2\/2046 where Isa bin Hittan said: I entered the Kufa Masjid where I saw Amr bin Maymoun sitting with some people. A man asked, \u201cWhat is the strangest thing that you said in the pre-Islamic times?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhen I was cultivating for the people at Yemen, I saw a group of monkeys that gathered. I saw a (male) monkey &#8211; or monkeys &#8211; that laid down, then another (female) monkey stick it\u2019s hand under it\u2019s neck. Then, they hugged. Then, another monkey came and poked her. She raised her head and looked at him. She then removed her hand from underneath the head of the (first male) monkey. Then, they moved to another area that wasn\u2019t too far away where I saw them having intercourse. Then the monkeys returned to where they came. She then attempted to put her hand under the neck of the (first male) monkey, he noticed something, got up, smelled her back-side, and scream. The monkeys gathered and he started to point at him and her. He (Amr bin Maymoun) said: Then then scattered. Not long after, the monkey was brought, and I was sure of how she looked. He said: They then placed them both in an area that had a lot of sand, placed them in a hole, then stoned them to death. He said: By Allah, I saw the act of stoning before Allah sent Mohammad &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Grading: All the narrators are reliable, with the exception of Isa bin Hittan. There isn\u2019t any information about him apart from Al-Ijli and Ibn Hibban who are known for strengthening unknown narrators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">Did Al-Bukhari Fabricate this Narration?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Before even explaining the narration, it is important for readers to be aware that this narration is that the event is not narrated by Al-Bukhari. That narration can also be found in Al-Khara\u2019itee\u2019s I\u2019itilal Al-Quloob #181 and Masawi\u2019 Al-Akhlaq #469. We have also previously quoted a more descriptive version of the hadith from Abu Nu\u2019aym\u2019s Ma\u2019rifat Al-Sahaba. Ibn Abd Al-Barr also includes this narration in his Istee\u2019aab and states that the chains of the narration all lead back to Abd Al-Malik bin Muslim, who heard it from Isa bin Hattan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Al-Bukhari in his Al-Tareekh Al-Kabeer quotes this narration through the path of Abu Balj as well. This means that this narration has three narrators narrating it from Amr bin Maymoun: (1) Hussain bin Abd Al-Rahman, (2) Isa bin Hittan, and (3) Abu Balj. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">With the above in mind, no sane person can accuse Al-Bukhari of fabricating this report, but the most that one can do is accuse Amr bin Maymoun, since three different people narrated this from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">Is this a Prophetic Narration?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">No. It is not. The narration from Amr bin Maymoun includes the events that he himself claims to have witnessed. He never said that the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; narrated these events. Shias that accuse Sunnis of attributing this to the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; only do so due to their blind hatred of Sunnism. If they were to read the hadith again, they would realize that their accusation is unfounded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">Are Sunnis Gullible for Believing in this Narration?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">The Qur\u2019an is filled with the supernatural, and yet, the supernatural events in the Qur\u2019an are accepted by both sects. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">To believe in the supernatural does not necessitate gullibility. Shia sources include heaps of material that contain supernatural elements that far exceed this narration by Amr bin Maymoun. However, Shias never dismiss those. The narration of Amr bin Maymoun is only targeted because it exists in a Sunni book, in this case, the most famous Sunni book, Saheeh Al-Bukhari.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Why do Sunnis accept this narration? Today, Sunnis believe in the narration because it was included in Saheeh Al-Bukhari. However, in the past, Amr bin Maymoun\u2019s narration was accepted since he was known to be a pious man. He was praised by Yahya bin Ma\u2019een and Nasa\u2019ee, as well as other hadithists. The companions of the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; accepted him as well. (See his biography in Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"tm6\">The Dilemma and <\/span><u><span class=\"tm8\">Hypocrisy<\/span><\/u><span class=\"tm6\"> of Shia Polemicists<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Even though Shias love to flaunt this hadith in the faces of Sunnis to suggest their gullibility and idiocy, they will use the narrations of Amr bin Maymoun whenever it suits them for polemical gains. It should be known that Shias argue that Amr bin Maymoun is the narrator of the narration which states that Ali slept in the bed of the Prophet &#8211; peace be upon him &#8211; when he migrated to Madinah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"tm7\">Refer to this narration in Wilayat.net in which the author mocks the hadith of Amr bin Maymoun above.
