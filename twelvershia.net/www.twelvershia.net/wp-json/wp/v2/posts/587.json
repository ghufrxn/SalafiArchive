I shall begin by explaining the title of this rather advanced topic Insha-Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First we present the following Qur&#8217;anic verse from Surat al-Baqarah:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>{And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, &#8220;Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.&#8221; [Abraham] said, &#8220;And of my descendants?&#8221; [Allah] said, &#8220;My covenant does not include the oppressors.&#8221;}<\/strong><b>\u00a0<\/b><strong>[2:124]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those who follow and observe Twelver Shia beliefs know that they use this verse as evidence that their Imams(Leaders) are protected from error, in other words infallible, unable to make mistakes or sins. They rely on the last part of this verse as evidence to prove this. They claim that the covenant of Allah is Imamah(Leadership) and\u00a0\u00a0that it does not go to &#8220;The oppressors&#8221; from the progeny of Ibrahim (as).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Twelver Shia define the word &#8220;oppressors&#8221; as anyone who has ever done an act of oppression in his entire life, which means that Allah is announcing that he will not award leadership to anyone who makes such mistakes, thus in Twelver Shia faith leadership can only go to infallible individuals who are protected from ever committing sin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The point of this article is, can this verse be used as a Qat`i evidence to prove that the leader must be infallible OR is it a Dhanni evidence?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Part -1:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Defining what is Qat`i evidence and what is Dhanni evidence<\/strong>, (The readers familiar with these terms may skip this part)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Islam is a religion of evidence, the Muslims must not invent matters in their own religion, everything they do should be based on some sort of proof, the strongest of proofs are usually Qur&#8217;anic texts and authentic prophetic sayings (Hadith). The majority of Muslims otherwise known as Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah always followed the strongest and most reliable of proofs, whereas deviant sects may cling to weak evidence such as twisting the meaning of a certain verse, or believing in unreliable narrations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Qat`i evidence is solid clear proof, when one sees it he shall acquire certainty, meaning the knowledge we gain from this piece of evidence is certain. Denying these types of evidence would take one out of Islam. For example the following verse is considered Qat`i evidence that Allah is &#8220;One&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>{Say: He is Allah, the One!}<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>[112:1]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If a Muslim were to say &#8220;No, Allah is Two!&#8221; he becomes a Kafir.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dhanni evidence is a weaker form of evidence, it means probable or speculative evidence, evidence that can accept more than one interpretation, it can be understood in more than one way. A practical example of this would be the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you spot a man standing next to the dead body of another person, and there are some blood stains on his clothes, you&#8217;d assume that he was the killer. However, it could be that he just came at the wrong time while the real killer had already made his escape, and that he got some blood on his clothes while trying to help the dying man, it does not necessarily mean that he killed him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another example from a Fiqhi perspective is the following Hadith:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet (saw) said: &#8220;No one touches the Qur&#8217;an except who is pure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This narration is authentic, but how do we understand its implications?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some scholars used this as proof that the woman on her period cannot touch the Qur&#8217;an because she is in a state of impurity. However, this is only a speculative analogy and a speculative evidence, it could be that by &#8220;pure&#8221; Allah meant the believers, because the Prophet (saw) said in another narration &#8220;The (touch of a) believer does not cause impurity.&#8221; So it could simply mean that Allah is forbidding non-Muslims from touching the Qur&#8217;an and that this has nothing to do with Muslim women on period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This makes the narration above a Dhanni(speculative) evidence for forbidding women from touching the Qur&#8217;an while on period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IF that narration were to say: &#8220;No one touches the Qur&#8217;an while on their periods.&#8221; Then it would have been a Qat`i(Certain) evidence for forbidding the women from this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course the matter is much more complicated than this, there are many sub-sections and types but this general explanation is enough for our article Insha-Allah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our case, we believe in the authority of the Qur&#8217;anic verse about the Imamah of Ibrahim (as), and we believe that none of the oppressors received the covenant of Allah exactly as the text says, BUT can this text be used as Solid Clear Qat`i evidence for the Shia belief in the infallibility of their leaders?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Insha-Allah, we will be proving that this verse which they claim is a clear Qat`i proof that the Imams are infallible since childhood is no more than a weak Dhanni evidence.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Part -2:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Shia leader must be infallible from birth until death and protected from sin and error or committing an evil act or an act of oppression.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shia leader Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Helli says in &#8220;Nahj al-Haqq&#8221;
