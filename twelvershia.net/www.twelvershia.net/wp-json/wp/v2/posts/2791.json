Please refer to our <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/06\/02\/shia-hadith-vs-sunni-hadith\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">earlier articles <\/a>to witness the superiority of Sunni hadith science over Shia hadith sciences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first condition for accepting a hadith as authentic, as listed by hadith scholars, is the connectivity of the chain. The existence of a disconnection causes the narration to be regarded as weak, for one cannot know where the narration came from if there was a disconnection.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A simple is the narration of Urwah bin Al-Zubair from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him. According to Yahya bin Ma\u2019een, Urwah was born around the year 24 AH. Due to his late birth, he could not have heard from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon &#8211; , and therefore, all his narrations from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 are graded as weak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As one can see, it is extremely important to know the year of the birth and death of narrators, for it solves a very important issue. If a narrator declares hearing a hadith though he wasn\u2019t born at the time of his \u201cteacher\u201d, he then is branded: a liar. Similarly, if we are not sure if a narrator heard from a person or not, knowing whether he lived in the same time and place or not allows us to ascertain if he heard from him or not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, this, one of the most important aspects of Rijali sciences, is one that is almost monopolized by Sunnis, since Shias have no choice but to rely on Sunni scholars for this information.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is clearest when studying the work of Al-Tusi. Even though he doesn\u2019t usually state where he got his information from, he does mention in the brief biography of Jabir bin Yazeed Al-Ju\u2019fi (Rijal Al-Tusi p. 129):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cJabir bin Yazeed bin Al-Harith bin Abd Yaghooth Al-Ju\u2019fi, died in the year 128 according to <strong>Ibn Hanbal<\/strong>. <strong>Yahya bin Ma\u2019een <\/strong>said: He died in the year 132.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do be aware that Jabir Al-Ju\u2019fi was one of the most important Shia hadith narrators of all time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In another interesting biography, Al-Tusi (Al-Rijal p. 125) mentions the biography of Ayoob Al-Sakhtiyani that he \u201cshaved his head from year to year, and split it if it grew.\u201d He then states that he died in the plague of Al-Basra in the year 131 AH. This random description of this narrator is the only precise and detailed one that we have of any narrator in the book. Not surprisingly, we find this to be a paraphrased from Tabaqat Ibn Sa\u2019ad 7\/187.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind that Ibn Sa\u2019ad predates Al-Tusi by two hundred years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other interesting aspects of Al-Tusi\u2019s weakness in this field is that he does not include any information of the year of birth or death of any narrator that was a companion of Al-Redha, Al-Jawad, Al-Hadi, or Al-Askari. He does only include one narrator from the companions of Musa Al-Kathim: Al-Hasan bin Mohammed bin Sama\u2019a, who Al-Tusi (Al-Rijal p. 335) mentions to have died on 263 AH.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only chapter that has a decent amount of birth\/death information is the chapter on the companions of Al-Sadiq. However, it is quite clear to the reader upon studying Al-Tusi\u2019s intro (p. 17) that the chapter of Al-Sadiq\u2019s companions is based on the book that was compiled by the Zaydi historian Ibn Uqdah, who Al-Tusi has obviously copied from. Al-Tusi is very much aware that Ibn Uqdah was a Zaydi, as he clearly states that in Ibn Uqdah\u2019s biography (Al-Rijal p. 409).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below is a list of those that narrated from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 whose years of deaths have been mentioned by Al-Tusi. Al- Tusi mentions 468 in his Rijal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first question we asked ourselves is: Why would Al-Tusi or any Shia have any knowledge of the years of deaths of those that narrated from the Prophet anyway?! It is not like they narrate any hadiths in the first place. Rather, this is another proof that Al-Tusi is simply quoting what he found in Sunni books. We have quoted the earlier Sunni source besides the year of death.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Anas bin Al-Harith \u2013 Killed in <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2016\/01\/29\/karbala-the-facts-and-the-fairytales\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Karbala<\/a> (Al-Jarh wal Ta\u2019deel 1\/213)<\/li>\n<li>Ubai bin Mu\u2019ath \u2013 Killed in B\u2019ir Ma\u2019oona (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/381)<\/li>\n<li>Anas bin Mu\u2019ath &#8211; Killed in B\u2019ir Ma\u2019oona (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/381)<\/li>\n<li>Anasa \u2013 Killed in either Badr or Uhud (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/35)<\/li>\n<li>Ayman bin Um Ayman \u2013 Killed in Uhud (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 2\/115 said he died in Hunain)<\/li>\n<li>Unais bin Qatada \u2013 Killed in Uhud (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/354)<\/li>\n<li>Al-Bara\u2019a bin Malik \u2013 Killed in Tustur (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 7\/12)<\/li>\n<li>Al-Bara\u2019a bin Ma\u2019roor \u2013 Died during the time of the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; and was one of the Nuqaba\u2019a (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/466)<\/li>\n<li>Bilal bin Rabah \u2013 Died in Dimashq in the year 18 and was buried at Bab Al-Sagheer (Ibn Sa\u2019ad 3\/180 Al-Waqidi says 20 AH)<\/li>\n<li>Basheer bin Sa\u2019ad \u2013 He fought in Badr.
