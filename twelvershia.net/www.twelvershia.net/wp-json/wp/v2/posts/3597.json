The reason being that the 11<sup>th<\/sup> Imam is not the eldest from among his siblings, rather, his brother; Mohammad Abu Ja\u2019afar was the eldest. Al-Nawbakhti states in his Firaq Al-Shia (p. 96) that a schism was created among the followers of Al-Hadi. Not only was Mohammad the eldest, but his followers claimed that they heard his father appoint him as the next Imam. When news arrived of his death, they denied it, and claimed that he was the Mahdi, hence, rejecting the conc ept that the Imams need to be Twelve. This group was known as Al-Mohammadiyyah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Al-Tusi narrates in his Kitab Al-Ghaybah (p. 82-83) that Abu Hashim Al-Ja\u2019afari was with Al-Hadi when his son Mohammad Abu Ja\u2019afar died. He states that Mohammad Abu Ja\u2019afar died after being appointed by Al-Hadi, though, Allah then revealed that Al-Askari is to be the Imam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is explicit proof of the inaccuracy of Al-Redha\u2019s sign\/prophecy or that Al-Hasan Al-Askari is a false Imam.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Received a Clear Appointment from His Predecessor<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the list that has been provided, there has not been a weaker piece of evidence than the \u201cclear appointment\u201d. Al-Redha states in Al-Kafi 1\/170 that if one were to enter a town and ask, \u201cWho was appointed as successor,\u201d he would be told. This suggests that the appointment was so clear, that the news was widely available.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, anyone who knows history could clearly see that this never occurred. Rather, ambiguity surrounded the identity of the Imams. Not only were the signs ambiguous, but there was a lot of disunity due to the lack of any clear appointments within Shia circles themselves. It goes without saying that none of these appointments can be found within Sunni texts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From Firaq Al-Shia by Al-Nawbakhti (p. 92-109), we find that upon the death of Al-Redha, his followers split into two sects. One followed his brother; Ahmad bin Musa, while another stopped believing in any other Imams, and started to believe that Musa Al-Kathim was the Mahdi. Those are known as the Waqifah. As for those that followed Al-Jawad, some of them followed his son Musa bin Mohammad before accepted Ali Al-Hadi. Not too long after, Ali Al-Hadi\u2019s followers accepted his son Ja\u2019afar bin Ali as the next Imam instead of Al-Hasan Al-Askari. Soon after, after the death of Al-Hasan Al-Askari, the Shias split into thirteen different sects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note<\/span>:<\/strong> We have only briefly discussed the confusion after Al-Redha without delving into the confusing period of the earlier Imams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3598 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"image-3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-3-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>It should also be known that not only was there a lack of a clear appointment, but the Imam would at times deny that he was the Imam. In the authentic tradition in Al-Kafi 1\/138, Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq was approached by two Zaydi men that asked if it was mandatory for them to follow him. He explicitly denied that he is to be followed.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Keeper of the Weapon <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u201cThe Weapon\u201d which is mentioned in the hadith is understood to be referring to Thu Al-Fiqar. The argument that can be made against this \u201csign\u201d is the lack of evidence thereof. There are not enough evidences in the narrations to even suggest that each of the Imams had Thu Al-Fiqar. Only through circular reasoning could someone arrive at this conclusion with the pre-conception of their Imamate being established in the first place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The usage of this \u201csign\u201d as evidence is also problematic since the narrations don\u2019t even include the companions of the Imams ever seeing Thu Al-Fiqar. With this in mind, how the sword even be used as proof for Imamate?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surprisingly, Al-Asma\u2019ee relates that he did <strong>see <\/strong>Thu Al-Fiqar with Haroon Al-Rasheed. This narration, which has no political motivation, can be found in Tareekh Al-Tabari 4\/1593.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Imam Cannot be Accused<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3604 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"409\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409-62x62.jpg 62w, https:\/\/www.twelvershia.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/409-184x184.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>The narration by Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq states that the Imams cannot be accused of lying, stealing, or fornication. This \u201csign\u201d is flawed since Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq was himself accused by the Batris and the followers of Sulaiman bin Jareer of lying. Those who were once companions of Ja\u2019afar Al-Sadiq eventually adopted the views of the accusers. See Al-Nawbakhti p. 76-77.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 was accused of lying by Quraish (see Surat Saad: 1-4), so it simply makes no sense that the Imams could not being accused due to some alleged divine protection against accusations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ultimate Proof against the Belief that All Twelve were Known<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The very fact that the Imams are being asked for signs, instead of the names of their successors, is clear proof that they were never told of their identities. The first narration alone is through Ibn Abi Nasr, who is one of Al-Redha\u2019s closest companions. (See Fihrist Al-Tusi p. 47) More importantly, the Imams do not respond to them by listing out the names of the remaining Imams, instead they provided them with \u201csigns\u201d. So, Al-Redha, instead of saying, \u201cMohammad, then Ali, then Al-Hasan, then finally Mohammad,\u201d provided the fragile \u201csigns\u201d that clearly demonstrate the falsehood of the Twelver belief.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One should also keep in mind that some of the schisms mentioned above, like the Waqifah and Al-Mohammadiyyah, do not follow twelve Imams, but chose a different number, which suggests that the belief that the Imams are twelve in number is one that was not held by several early Shia sects.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, there is no way for one to determine the identities of the Imams. Twelvers are captives of their own conjecture after accepting Shiasm. If modern Shias were more thorough in their search for truth, they would not jump on the Twelver bandwagon. Instead, they would carefully examine the evidences for each of the Imams\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2026before ultimately rejecting them due to the lack of evidence for their Imamate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>According to Twelver Shia beliefs the Imams have signs that prove their Imamah.
