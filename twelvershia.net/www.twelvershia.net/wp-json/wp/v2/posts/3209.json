Firstly, it does not include any evidence of foul play from Abu Huraira. He never said that he heard the hadith from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; . His mistake was that he relied on what he heard from Al-Fadhl bin Al-Abbas without asking him if he heard it from the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; .<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reliance on reports one hears from others is a mistake that many of us make. We often hear preachers on the pulpits or on television speaking of narrations that are incorrectly attributed to the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; . When we relate those narrations to our peers, we often neglect naming our sources. Instead, we simply say, \u201cThe Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 said&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, those of us that fall into this error are not accused of fabricating the narration.
