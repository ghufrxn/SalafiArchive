Because You misled me, I shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I (Iblees) shall mislead them all except Your chosen (guided) servants among them.\u201d (Allah) said: \u201cThis is the way which will lead straight to Me. \u201cCertainly, you shall have no authority over My servants, except those of the astray who follow you. And surely, Hell is the place promised for them all. Holy Qur\u2019aan (15.39-40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201cVerily, he (Iblees) has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord\u201d Holy Qur\u2019aan (16.99)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201cExcept to a Messenger whom He has chosen, and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.\u201d Holy Qur\u2019aan (72.27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201cThen I (Iblees) will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them to be thankful.\u201d Holy Qur\u2019aan (17.16)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It is clear from the above conversation that Allah (swt) has promised that Satan has no means into His sincere Servants, and only wrong-doers will follow the Him. Thus the Sincere Servants of Allah (swt) are not wrong-doers and shall not be deceived. Also Allah (swt) confirms that the Path of His Sincere Servants is a path which leads straight to Him (swt). All these facts prove that the Sincere Servants of Allah(swt) never fall into the trap of Satan, and as such they are infallible, due to Allah\u2019s (swt) Mercy. This is not just restricted to \u201cProphet\u201d or \u201cMessenger\u201d alone it encompass all righteous servants till the day of Judgement!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated \u2018Aisha: Magic was worked on the Prophet so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, \u201cI feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, \u201cWhat is the ailment of this man?\u201d The other replied, \u2018He has been bewitched\u201d The first asked, \u2018Who has bewitched him?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018Lubaid bin Al-A\u2019sam.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018What material has he used?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018A comb, the hair gathered on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the male date-palm.\u2019 The first asked, \u2018Where is that?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018It is in the well of Dharwan.\u2019 \u201d So, the Prophet went out towards the well and then returned and said to me on his return, \u201cIts date-palms (the date-palms near the well) are like the heads of the devils.\u201d I asked, \u201cDid you take out those things with which the magic was worked?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, for I have been cured by Allah and I am afraid that this action may spread evil amongst the people.\u201d Later on the well was filled up with earth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Source: Sahih Bukhari Vol. 4, Book 54, # 490<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Lubaid bin Al-A\u2019sam dumped a comb, the hair gathered on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the male date-palm, as a mechanism for performing black magic on the Prophet (saw), that was effective that he would assume he was doing that which he had not done (Salat etc)<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Whilst offering prayers he inform Aisha (la) that he has been fully informed of the magic done on him, and the contents used to enable it, and the well wherein the items were placed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">He visits the locality, and returns to Aisha (la) informing her of what he had observed<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Aisha (la) sought clarification as to whether the items had been disposed of, to which the Prophet (saw) said the matter was otiose he had been cured by Allah (swt) and he did not want the matter to be propagated, lest it create Fitnah amongst his subjects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">We would like to pose some questions that remain unclear:-<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The Prophet (saw) would assume that he had done that which he had not done, so when supplicating did he not already assumed he had done just that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Then he informs Aisha, did he not already think that had informed her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Before visit Dharwan, did he not assume that he had already gone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Why did he (saw) choose to only disclose the entire matter to Aisha and not his other wives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">What did the Prophet (saw) do to curtail the effects of the magic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">He (saw) did not remove the offending items?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Were the effects of magic simply removed by his visiting Dharwan and then reporting back its description to Aisha?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The Prophet (saw) did not want this matter to be disclosed to his subjects, so why did Aisha inform her nephew Urwah, who informed his Hisham about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">If they knew how many other people did they tell? Why were they propagating that which the Prophet (saw) wanted kept secret?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First of all, his understanding of the verses is not accurate, here for instance Iblees affects Prophet Ayyub (as),<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, \u201cIndeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment.\u201d} [38:41]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We ask: Is Ayyub (as) an evil-doer? Obviously Not!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Or this verse:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And if a whisper from the devil reach thee (O Muhammad) then seek refuge in Allah. Lo! He is the Hearer, the Knower.} [41:36]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We ask: Is Muhammad (saw) an evil-doer? Certainly Not!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The verses quoted by RTS, they do not mean that Iblees does not affect pious people at all, but they mean that if a believer is strong in his faith and he places his full trust in Allah, then Iblees would not be able to deceive them and take them out of the folds of the righteous and turn them unbelievers. In other words, the verses do not mean they are infallible, it simply means that Iblees would not be able to dominate them and turn them to disbelief.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the questions of RTS, they&#8217;re stupid as the reader can see. When it is mentioned that the Prophet (saww) thought or assumed that he was doing a thing which he was actually not doing, it doesn&#8217;t mean that it happened every time, and this is a very simple thing to understand because if we knew that a person often forgets, this doesn&#8217;t mean that he forgets all the time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, if RTS has only read this Hadith from Ayesha, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the Prophet (peace be upon him) only mentioned this to Ayesha.

However, the Prophet (saw) did not wish to reveal the object that was used to cast the spell, this is because he feared it would get people&#8217;s attention and make some of them interested in learning magic, so he didn&#8217;t show it to save the nation from corruption.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So far we have already refuted RTS&#8217;s entire article, but we will briefly comment on the rest, just for fun:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Source: Sahih Bukhari. Vol. 7, Book 71, H. # 658.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Narrated A\u2019isha: A man called Labid bin Al-A\u2019sam from the tribe of Bani Zaraiq worked magic on Allah\u2019s Apostle till Allah\u2019s Apostle started imagining that he had done a thing that he had not really done. One day or one night he was with us, he invoked Allah (swt) and invoked for a long period, and then said, \u201cO A\u2019isha! Do you know that Allah (swt) has instructed me concerning the matter I have asked him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. One of them said to his companion, \u2018What is the disease of this man?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018He is under the effect of magic.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Who has worked the magic on him?\u2019 The other replied, \u201cLabid bin Al-A\u2019sam.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018What material did he use?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018A comb and the hairs stuck to it and the skin of pollen of a male date palm.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Where is that?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018(That is) in the well of Dharwan.\u2019 \u201d So Allah\u2019s Apostle along with some of his companions went there and came back saying, \u201cO A\u2019isha, the colour of its water is like the infusion of Henna leaves. The tops of the date-palm trees near it are like the heads of the devils.\u201d I asked, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Apostle? Why did you not show it (to the people)?\u201d He said, \u201cSince Allah (swt) cured me, I disliked to let evil spread among the people.\u201d Then he ordered that the well be filled up with earth.This and the previous tradition are at variance with one another despite the narrator being A\u2019isha.<\/span><\/div>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition we are informed of the tribe of Labaid<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In previous traditions there is no mention of the Prophet (saw) being accompanied by anyone when attending Dharwan, but here we are informed that companions were with him. A\u2019isha does not elaborate on who these individuals were, one is therefore unsure whether this was due to extenuating circumstances or for her dislike of certain individuals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In the previous Hadeeth, upon his return from Dharwan A\u2019isha asks\u00a0<strong>\u201c<\/strong>Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?\u201d, buy here she seeks clarity to ascertain whether the products were made subject to a public display \u201cWhy did you not show it (to the people)?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Our question is why was she keen to know whether the items in questions had been shown to the public?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It is indeed unusual that Ai\u2019sha wanted to know if the items used for the black magic has been displayed publicly, when the second man had already identified them to the Prophet (saw). A\u2019isha knew the products that had been used, so why was she curious as to whether or not others had also seen them? Surely someone must have given these items to Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A\u2019sam, a comb used by the Prophet (saw) with his hair on it. One presumes Aisha was no doubt confused as to how this item reached the possession of Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A\u2019sam when she personally combed his hair.\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt that Aisha was favoured for this task, to the point that she even performed this task whilst the Prophet (saw) was in the mosque. Clearly this must have truly perplexed A\u2019isha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now this is called freestyle speculations, in which the Shias are masters. So the comb was provided to Lubaid by the wife of the Prophet (saww) to whom he revealed his dream. Perhaps the Prophet (saww) trusted his wife more than the Shias, and he was more aware of his wife than the Shias. In any case, just because Lubaid was not mentioned in the previous tradition, it doesn\u2019t mean contradiction. For it would mean that many verses of Quran are also contradictory, because in some verses, one fact is not mentioned, while in another verse, it is mentioned. For example,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We read in the Holy Quran [7:150] that Moses grabbed Aaron from his head on one occasion, and regarding the very same occasion, we read in Holy Quran [20:94] that Moses grabbed Aaron from his head as well as beard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[007:150]\u00a0\u00a0When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: \u201cEvil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?\u201d He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: \u201cSon of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[020:094]\u00a0\u00a0(Aaron) replied: \u201cO son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard nor by (the hair of) my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, \u2018Thou has caused a division among the children of Israel, and thou didst not respect my word!\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So only an ignorant, like the writers at RTS, can consider this as contradiction. And just because Ayesha didn\u2019t name few individuals doesn\u2019t mean that this was due to her dislike for certain people. This especially can\u2019t be accepted if we know that `Aisha narrated authentic virtues of this person whom the Shia claim she hated. The un-mentioning of their names in a far lesser incident like this one can not be considered dislike for them, by any sane person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as the question of Ayesha regarding why the Prophet (saww) didn&#8217;t take out that material is concerned, it is obvious that she wanted that the people realize that the Prophet (saww) was affected by this magic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Sahih Bukhari.

Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?\u2019 The latter replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has worked magic on him?\u2019 The other replied Labid bin Al-A\u2019sam, a man from Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a hypocrite.\u2019 The first one asked, What material did he use)?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018A comb and the hair stuck to it.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Where (is that)?\u2019 The other replied. \u2018In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan\u2019 \u201d So the Prophet went to that well and took out those things and said \u201cThat was the well which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.\u201d The Prophet added, \u201cThen that thing was taken out\u2019 I said (to the Prophet ) \u201cWhy do you not treat yourself with Nashra?\u201d He said, \u201cAllah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">This tradition conflicts with the previous two discussed. In those we are informed that the Prophet (saw) was unsure if he had done something, here Aisha elaborates what this meant at the ground level, providing an actual example that in many ways clarifies matters.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly this black magic\u2019s effect was linked to conjugal relations, and it must have reached the hand of\u00a0\u00a0Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A\u2019sam from that individual that would have sought it useful that the Prophet (saw) assumed he had had conjugal relations with his wife when he had in fact not.\u00a0\u00a0If it worked, it would have meant the Prophet (saw) not visiting some of his wives, as he would have assumed that he (saw) had spent the night with them when he had not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Lubaid bin Al-A\u2019sam is referred to as a hypocrite, ally of the Jews. If one analyses history it is not difficult to identify such a category of person. Aisha manages to identify Lubaid bin Al-A\u2019sam, so which individuals did he frequent with? Did he survive the Prophet (saw) or not?\u00a0\u00a0If he outlived him (saw) which group of Muslims did he attach himself with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition we are told that the used item were removed whilst in the other traditions we are told the well was filled with earth.\u00a0\u00a0When the Prophet approaches Dharwan he states \u201cThat was the well which was shown to me (in a dream)\u2026\u201d but he does not state this in the other traditions. In this tradition the second man discloses the precise location wherein the materials can be located \u2018In a skin of pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan\u2019 \u201d whilst in the others he simply states \u201cIt is in the well of Dharwan\u201d. This tradition concludes with the Prophet refusing treatment with Nashra, no such reference is made of this offer by Aisha (la) in the other traditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again these are outright speculations to defame Ayesha [ra], which is why they don\u2019t even make sense, for why would a wife of the Prophet [saww] want to cast a black magic upon her husband!? Especially if it could make him err regarding whether he had performed his conjugal rights or not. Secondly, there is no conflict, just few facts are elaborated more in this narration than in the previous narration. Elaboration or \u201cextra detail\u201d is never considered a contradiction by any knowledgeable person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as the identity of Lubaid al-Asam is concerned, the fact is that Shias don\u2019t have the biography of a lot of companions of the Prophet [saww], perhaps RTS meant the Sunni books. The Sunni books have documented the biographies of much more people surrounding the Prophet [saww] than the Shias, rather even a big Shia narrator like Zurarah is also a very less documented person as far as his biography is concerned.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, RTS is trying to disprove the Hadith only on the basis that it has a few more elaborations than the previous narrations, which as I mentioned is never considered a contradiction. But by using the same principle, I can prove multiple contradictions between (1) The identity of the mother of the 12th Imam (2) The Hadith of Ghadeer (3) The incident of the house burning of Fatima (4) The incident of <a href=\"http:\/\/twelvershia.net\/2014\/05\/08\/fadak-prophetic-inheritance-qa\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Fadak<\/a> (5) The Mushaf of Fatima, etc. But for the time being, we shall leave it aside for the convenience of the readers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Sahih Bukhari.

One of them asked his companion, \u2018What is the disease of this man?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018He is under the effect of magic.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Who has worked magic on him?\u201d The other replied, \u2018Labid bin A\u2019sam, a Jew from the tribe of Bani Zuraiq.\u2019 The (first one asked), \u2018With what has it been done?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018With a comb and the hair stuck to it and a skin of the pollen of a male datepalm tree.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Where is it?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018In the well of Dharwan.\u2019 Then the Prophet went along with some of his companions to that well and looked at that and there were date palms near to it. Then he returned to me and said, \u2018By Allah the water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palms were like the heads of devils\u201d I said, O Allah\u2019s Apostle! Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?\u201d He said, \u2018No!

In the second tradition Lubaid bin Al-A\u2019sam is unknown, here we know his faith and his tribe. In the previous tradition Lubaid\u00a0\u00a0bin Al-A\u2019sam is referred to as a hypocrite ally of the Jews whilst here he is a Jew.\u00a0\u00a0In this tradition he ventures to the well with companions whilst in two previous traditions no mention is made of him being accompanied by anyone.\u00a0\u00a0In the previous traditions the Prophet (saw) asks a rhetorical question and expands on what has been disclosed to him, before A\u2019isha answers.\u00a0\u00a0But here A\u2019isha is given the opportunity to respond and asks\u00a0<strong>,\u00a0<\/strong>\u201cWhat is that, O Allah\u2019s Apostle?\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0His tribe has been mentioned in the previous narration as well, so that is a mis-statement by RTS itself. Secondly, as far as his religion is concerned, we know for sure that the hypocrites were not atheists, before apparently embracing Islam. They all had some religion, so Lubaid was a Jew, who apparently embraced Islam, and hence he was considered a hypocrite. As far as the other so called tradition is mentioned by RTS that in the two previous traditions, no mention is made of him being accompanied by anyone, then you can see in the tradition\u00a0<strong>Book 71, H. # 658\u00a0<\/strong>which has been mentioned earlier, that there it was mentioned that the Prophet [saww]\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u2018<em>along with some of his companions went there and came back<\/em><\/span>\u2018.\u00a0Hence this is another mis-statement by RTS.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Source: Saheeh Bukhari. Vol. 8, Book 73, # 89.<\/strong>Narrated A\u2019isha: The Prophet (saw) continued for such-and-such period imagining that he has slept (had sexual relations) with his wives, and in fact he did not. One day he said, to me, \u201cO \u2018Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding a matter about which I had asked Him. There came to me two men, one of them sat near my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), \u2018What is wrong with this man? The latter replied, \u2018He is under the effect of magic.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018Who had worked magic on him?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018Lubaid bin Asam.\u2019 The first one asked, \u2018What material (did he use)?\u2019 The other replied, \u2018The skin of the pollen of a male date tree with a comb and the hair stuck to it, kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan.\u201d\u2018 Then the Prophet went to that well and said, \u201cThis is the same well which was shown to me in the dream. The tops of its date-palm trees look like the heads of the devils, and its water looks like the Henna infusion.\u201d Then the Prophet ordered that those things be taken out. I said, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Apostle! Won\u2019t you disclose (the magic object)?\u201d The Prophet said, \u201cAllah has cured me and I hate to circulate the evil among the people.\u201d A\u2019isha added, \u201c(The magician) Lubaid bin Asam was a man from Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In this tradition (unlike the previous) the Prophet (saw) makes no form of supplication that enables the reality to be revealed to him. The tradition from Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Number 66 informs us \u2018The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?\u2019 The latter replied the is under the effect of magic whilst this tradition informs us The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), \u2018What is wrong with this man?\u2019.<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact this tradition is very similar to the tradition of\u00a0<strong>Book 71, H. # 660.<\/strong>\u00a0There is only the mentioning of invocation in the words\u00a0<em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u2018about which I had asked Him\u2019<\/span>\u00a0<\/em>just like in this tradition. And everyone can understand that this means invocation. So it is clearly mentioned in this narration. As far as the second contradiction is concerned, that is a contradiction but a minor one, and the narrations in such cases are not rejected, neither in the Sunni science of hadith, nor in the Shia science of hadith, and plenty of examples can be given from the Shia books, and the one with the better chain of transmission is given superiority in such case. Such minor contradictions arise in the narrations often in the transmission of the narration, since the narrators are humans who can err in the details, even if they are truthful.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Sahih Bukhari. Volume 8, Book 75, Number 400.<\/strong>Narrated \u2018Aisha: that Allah\u2019s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, \u201cO \u2018Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?\u201d \u2018Aisha said, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Apostle!

Allah\u2019s Apostle went to that well and returned to \u2018Aisha, saying, \u2018By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion of Hinna, and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.\u2019 \u2018Aisha added, Allah\u2019s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, \u2018O Allah\u2019s Apostle, why didn\u2019t you take out the skin of pollen?\u2019 He said, \u2018As for me, Allah has cured me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn and harm others with)\u201d<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Notice how in the very first tradition the Prophet (saw) keep all the items in the well, but here A\u2019isha asks \u201c<strong>Why didn\u2019t you take out the skin of pollen?\u201d<\/strong>That suggests he removed the comb and hair!\u00a0\u00a0This question is not asked in the previous traditions.<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exact translation in this case should be \u2018Why didn\u2019t you take it out?\u2019 since in the original Arabic text, the exact word for the skin of pollen has not been used, the translator has mentioned the words \u2018the skin of the pollen\u2019 but they are not found in the Arabic text, and he might have considered it to be referring to the skin of pollen, but that can be his personal view. As far as the original text of the narration is concerned, we don\u2019t find it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The entire notion of the Prophet (saw) becoming a victim of witchcraft is indeed a deeply shameless one! It makes a mockery of the doctrine of Prophethood, wherein the appointed one of Allah (swt) loses his thinking capability blurred by witchcraft, and is of the actions that he has performed. The difficulty is when A\u2019isha has narrated it, then there is some need for him to find an appropriate place to record it, but where? What is the precise nexus between these traditions and their being placed in a Chapter that deal with the creation and good manners?\u00a0\u00a0What can one learn from good manners by reading a Hadeeth that discusses black magic being performed on the Prophet (saw)?<\/span><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The Prophethood would suffer if the Prophets can commit mistakes in matters dealing with the preaching of religious rulings and beliefs, although since they are divinely corrected if they commit mistakes, this also doesn\u2019t cause problem in the prophethood. But as far as matters apart from the religion is concerned, they can forget and they can commit mistakes as well. If this is indeed a disgusting opinion, than this was the view of heavyweight Shia scholars such as Shaikh Sadooq, Shaikh ibn al-Waleed and a number of other major Shia scholars. And this is also evidenced by authentic Shia narrations. But as far as witchcraft is concerned, we read in the Holy Quran [20:66] that the rods and the ropes which the magicians threw appeared to be moving to Moses. So it means that the spell worked on the Prophets as well. But since they are divinely protected, hence Allah protects them. And that is what Allah did when he protected Moses from the magicians and that is what Allah did when he protected the Prophet [saww] from the magic of Lubaid ibn al-Asam. Rather in this incident is a virtue of the Prophet [saww] that Allah protected him and showed him the truth in his dream. If he was not a divinely appointed Prophet, he would not have been informed with how the plot was made.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RTS finally concludes:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">From this, one can only conclude that according to the Nasibi Aqeeda based on the Qur\u2019aanic passages above and their most authentic books of Hadeeth the Prophet (saw) was not righteous and Allah (swt) therefore decided to hand him over to the power and control of Satan by the effects of magic, or Allah (swt) wasn\u2019t powerful enough to save his chosen Apostle (saw) from this.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0649 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650\u00a0\u0643\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064c \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062c\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u064a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627\u00a0\u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0638\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u00a0\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0651 \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0645\u064e\u0651\u0633\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b<\/strong><strong>\u201cOr (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat\u201d\u00a0And the wrongdoers (disbelievers)\u00a0say: \u201cYou follow none but a man bewitched\u201d\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Holy Qur\u2019aan\u00a0<\/strong><strong>(25.8)<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A\u2019isha took a stand with the oppressive polytheists that accused the messenger of Allah (swt) of been bewitched.
