A metaphor for His light is a lantern in which there is a lamp placed in a glass. The glass is like a shining star, which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither eastern nor western. Its oil almost lights up even though the fire has not touched it. It is light upon light. Allah (swt) guides to His light whoever He wants. Allah (swt) uses various metaphors. He has the knowledge of all things.&#8217; [24:35] The Imam (a.s) said, &#8220;Lantern&#8221; metaphorically stands for the Holy lady, Faatimah (s.a), the &#8220;Lamp&#8221; stands for Imam Al-Hassan (a.s) and &#8220;the glass&#8221; stands for Imam Al-Hussain (a.s), &#8220;The shining star&#8221; stands for the Holy lady Fatimah (s.a), who shines among the ladies of the world. &#8220;The blessed olive tree&#8221; stands for Prophet Ibraheem (a.s). &#8220;Neither eastern nor western&#8221; means not Jewish nor Christian. The expression: &#8220;Its oil almost lights up&#8221; means that it almost bursts up with knowledge. &#8220;Light upon light&#8221; means that there will be one Imam (a.s) after the other Imam (a.s). &#8220;Allah (swt) guides to His light whoever He wants&#8221; means that Allah (swt) guides through the A&#8217;immah (plural of Imam) whoever He wants.&#8217; About the expression &#8220;Allaah (swt) uses various metaphors&#8221; I then recited the following verse of the Holy Qur&#8217;aan: &#8216;Or they (the deeds of the unbelievers) are like the darkness of a deep stormy sea with layers of giant waves, covered by dark clouds. It is darkness upon darkness whereby even if one stretches out his hands he cannot see them. One can have no light unless Allah (swt) gives him light.&#8217; {24:40}. The Imam (a.s) said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Darkness&#8217; refers to the first (i.e. Aboo Bakr) and his friend (i.e. Umar). The expression &#8216;With layers of giant waves&#8217; refers to the third (i.e. Uthman ibn Affan), and the expression &#8216;Covered with darkness&#8217; refers to the second (i.e. Umar). The words &#8216;It is darkness upon darkness&#8217; refer to Mu&#8217;awiyah (may Allah condemn him) and the disasters caused by the Umayyads. The phrase &#8216;Even if one stretches out his hands&#8217; means that even if a true believer stretches out his hands in such disastrous condition &#8216;he cannot see them.&#8217; The statement &#8216;One can have no light unless Allah (swt) gives him light&#8217; stands for the light from the children of the Holy lady, Fatimah (s.a). The phrase &#8216;Can have no light&#8217; means an Imam on the Day of Judgment. The Imam (a.s) said that, &#8220;On the Day of Judgment, you will see the believers with their light shining in front of them and to their right. They will be told, &#8216;Paradise wherein streams flow is the glad news for you today. You will live therein forever. This is the greatest triumph [57:12].'&#8221; The phrase &#8216;The shining light in front&#8230;&#8217; is a reference to the Imam (a.s), who will walk in front and on the right of the true believers until they all enter paradise.'&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First of all we begin by saying: Praise be to God that we are not among the confused or the innovators! Praise be to him that he has guided us to the correct path, to the path of \u00a0light by his grace and blessing. Praise be to him who protected us from the deviance and the darkness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the readers can see, this Shia narration is ridiculous to the extent that we need not refute it, the Qur&#8217;an itself rejects it and the healthy mind rejects it. This is because the Imami Shia sect invented the belief of the divine leadership of `Ali (ra), and they placed so much emphasis on `Ali (ra) and his family, but at the same time the Qur&#8217;an mentions nothing about this, not even their names are mentioned, so the Shia scholars had to resort to these silly interpretations, it is as if the Qur&#8217;an is not a clear book but a coded one! By attributing these fabrications to Ahlul-Bayt, they managed to forcefully shove the names of the Imams in the Qur&#8217;an. On the other hand, a less intellectual group of Shia scholars claimed that the names of the Imams was present in the Qur&#8217;an but the companions removed it out of spite.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, should one look at the same scanned page of al-Kafi that RTS quoted the above narration from, on that same page you&#8217;ll find even more ridiculous narrations, for example, the narration above this one says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[abi Khalid al-Kabuli said: I asked abu Ja`far (as) about the saying of Allah <span style=\"color: #008000;\">{So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Light which We have sent down.}<\/span> the Imam said: &#8220;O abu Khalid, by Allah, the Light here means the Imams!&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the light according to the Muslims is the guidance of Allah, the revelation of Allah, This is why Allah said {The light which we have SENT DOWN}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As one can read in similar verses the guidance being referred to as a Light:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{Say, &#8220;Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light and guidance to the people?}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">or<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now should you check the other narration under it, it says:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Muhammad bin al-Fudayl: I asked abu al-Hasan (as) about the words of Allah <span style=\"color: #008000;\">{They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths}<\/span> he (as) said: &#8220;They wish to extinguish the authority of the chief of believers (as) with their mouths.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Muslims explain it, as the Kouffar trying to speak falsehood and accuse the Prophet (saw) of corruption and magic so they can end his message. On the other hand, the readers can see that the Shia scholars as usual went and explained it as the Wilayah of `Ali (ra). We hope the readers notice a pattern here, that any verse with a slightly vague word will be interpreted by the Shia as &#8220;Imamah&#8221; or &#8220;Wilayah&#8221; that&#8217;s how weak their creed is. If they spot the word &#8220;Light&#8221; they&#8217;ll explain it as Imam, if they spot the word &#8220;Lamp&#8221; they&#8217;ll explain it as al-Hasan (ra), if they spot the word &#8220;Believers&#8221; they will say this refers to `Ali (ra) only, and so on&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now we go back to the Hadith quoted by RTS at the beginning, the original verses in the Qur&#8217;an are as follows, and the parts in <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">RED<\/span><\/strong> are the explanations of the Shia according to their authentic narration:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>FIRST VERSE:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{And We have certainly sent down to you distinct verses and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear Allah.
