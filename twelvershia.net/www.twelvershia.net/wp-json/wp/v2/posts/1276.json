This means that you as a narrator, attribute to another narrator certain words that you haven&#8217;t heard directly from his mouth, rather you learned of them through some other means, maybe some person told you, or you read them in a certain book, or you saw him\u00a0in a dream or whatever indirect ways you can think of. A narrator who often does so and is popular for it, is known as a &#8220;Mudallis&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Seeghat-ul-Sama`&#8221; and &#8220;Tadlees&#8221; these two terms\u00a0are very much linked to one another and have always caused issues for the scholars of Hadith in the past. This is because there are two types of\u00a0&#8220;Seeghat-ul-Sama`&#8221;\u00a0the first are clear ones and the second are broad ambiguous ones. Examples:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A- &#8220;Zayd said: `Amr has told me&#8221; This is a strong\u00a0expression of transmission and a clear declaration of\u00a0Zayd that he has indeed heard whatever it is that he shall narrate from `Amr&#8217;s mouth directly.\u00a0This is the favorite type of narration to Hadith scholars, for any truthful, honest man, whether known for being\u00a0a Mudallis (one who commits Tadlees) or not, if he\u00a0uses clear words like those, he will have his Hadith accepted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- &#8220;It was narrated by Zayd, from `Amr&#8221; OR &#8220;From Zayd that `Amr said&#8221;\u00a0In both cases, we cannot be certain that Zayd heard from `Amr, he may have heard it from someone else. This is especially problematic if Zayd was a known Mudallis. In such a case, scholars would be cautious when he used unclear terms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is Tadlees harmful? The answer is of-course yes, in many cases a trustworthy man might attribute a Hadith to some scholar, and people would think this Hadith is authentic and they would worship Allah based on it. However, later they find out that this trustworthy man did not at any point meet up with this scholar, he actually heard the report from another man who is completely unreliable and unqualified, sometimes even a liar or fabricator, and this suspicious character was the one who claimed he heard it from that scholar, in which case one has to abandon worshiping Allah based on what reached them through this unreliable person.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Popular Sunni narrator and Imam of Hadith Shu`bah bin Al-Hajjaj (d. 160 AH) used to say about his teacher: I would pay attention\u00a0to the mouth of Qatadah; if he said, \u201cI heard,\u201d then, I would write down his narration. However, I wouldn&#8217;t write if he didn&#8217;t say it. (Mu\u2019jam Al-Mudalliseen p. 371)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though Shu`bah was known for his extra caution with Tadlees, one could easily find similar practices from his predecessors from the Tabi`een(Followers), and this trend continued until scholars created compendiums for the known Mudalliseen, like Al-Shathakooni, Al-Nasa\u2019ee, Al-Daraqutni, and others from the early scholars. Then this trend continued into larger books by Abu Zur`ah Al-`Iraqi, Sibt Ibn Al-A`ajami, and Al-Suyuti, from among the late scholars, as well as Ibn Hajar whose book (with 153 popular narrators accused of Tadlees) became the most popular in the field. This kept going\u00a0until our current times where contemporaries collected all that was written by those earlier scholars and studied the practical and theoretical aspects, all in order to serve the students of knowledge. One of which is the very useful book Riwayat Al-Mudalliseen fi Saheeh Al-Bukhari by Awwad Al-Khalaf, in which he argued against every single accusation that Al-Bukhari\u2019s book may have an unclear Seeghah that would suggest Tadlees.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An example of this is the following narration of al-Bukhari: From abi Ishaaq, <strong>from<\/strong>\u00a0al-Bara&#8217;, he said: \u201cWhile a companion of the Prophet (saw) was reading and his horse was tied\u2026etc\u201d [Al-Bukhari #4839]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The words: \u201c<strong>from<\/strong>\u00a0al-Bara\u2019\u201d, this is not considered straightforward. Such narrations are usually rejected. However, Al-Bukhari was aware of this fact, but only included this narration in his book since he was sure that abu Ishaaq did in fact hear this narration. Proof of this is found also in his Saheeh in another chapter where he quoted the same Hadith, but this time in this form: abu Ishaaq says, \u201c<strong>I heard<\/strong> al-Bara\u2019 bin `Aazib.\u201d See Al-Bukhari #3614.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It should be noted that al-Bukhari is not one that would cheat those that read his book by substituting an unclear Seeghaht al-Sama`with a clear one.

How is this information beneficial to Shias? Would it not be better to provide an example of a Shi\u2019ee narrator in order to have Shias be aware of Mudalliseen in their books?! The answer is simple. The Shias do not have examples of Mudalliseen or books that have collected the names of the Mudalliseen, which is why they have no choice but to give examples from Sunni books regarding Sunni narrators.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sunni student of knowledge Shaykh Sa`d ibn Rashid al-Shanfa,\u00a0in his study of the subject, went through several books by major Shia Hadith scholars, and could not find an instance in which those scholars would provide a Shi\u2019ee example, even though each of these authors wrote about Tadlees!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The names of the Shi`ee scholars are: Al-Shaheed Al-Thani, Al-Husayn bin `Abd Al-Samad Al-`Amili, Agha Fadhil Darbandi, `Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Ha\u2019iri, Al-Jalali, Al-Kajoori, Mullah `Ali Kuni, Ja`far Al-Subhani, `Abdullah Al-Mamaqani, `Ali Akbar Ghifari, Abu Fadhl Al-Babili, and `Ali Al-Berujerdi.

Ja`far Al-Subhani, at the end of the chapter on Tadlees said (p. 117): &#8220;Luckily, it is very rare for us to find this (Tadlees al-shuyookh \u2013 another type of Tadlees) and that of the first type (of Tadlees) in our Imami narrations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet we -and anyone familiar with the science- do believe that al-Subhani should be worried, in fact he should be very worried, and this is for a simple reason, the Imamiyyah take almost all of their narrations from the people of Qum in Persia, who in turn took them from the people of Kufah in `Iraq, so what significance does this hold when it comes to Tadlees? Let us quote the expert scholars of Hadith so the matter can be clarified.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam of Hadith al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said in his book &#8220;al-Jami`&#8221; 2\/286: &#8220;The most correct chains for prophetic-traditions\u00a0are\u00a0those of\u00a0the people of al-Haramayn -Makkah and Madinah-, for their Tadlees is minimal, and the number of those who are popular liars and fabricators among them is very small.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Okay, it seems the people who lived\u00a0in\u00a0the society of the descendants of the family and the descendants of the companions of Rasul-Allah (saw)\u00a0are\u00a0more careful in their narrations and more God fearing than those Arabs who lived in other regions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam of Hadith al-Hafiz al-Hakim al-Naysaburi says in his book &#8220;al-Ma`rifah&#8221; pg.111: &#8220;And the ones who practice Tadlees the most out of all narrators, are the people of Kufah, and a small group from the people of Basarah.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is why al-Subhani should be terribly worried, his narrations mainly come from the people of a city which was popular for Tadlees.

While on the other hand, the Shia failed in both documenting the names of the Mudalliseen and also documenting the Seeghah in which the Hadith was mentioned nor do they document the dates of birth and death of their narrators, which causes Al-Kafi to fail in credibility and precision of its reports in comparison to Al-Bukhari as we cannot know if a narrator lived to meet another, or if a narrator heard what he heard from his teacher directly or from some liar here or there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>In continuation of our mini-series in our practical comparisons between Saheeh Al-Bukhari and Al-Kulayni\u2019s Al-Kafi, we look at one of the finer points of Hadith science, specifically, Seeghat al-Sama` and Tadlees.
