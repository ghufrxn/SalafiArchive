In the article titled <em>\u2018Saqifa; the debacle of Islamic Government<\/em>,<em>\u2019<\/em> the Answering-Ansar team has tried the same by \u201cproving\u201d that the Companions of Prophet Mu\u0125ammad (saws)\u2014particularly Ab\u016b Bakr and `Umar (ra)\u2014abandoned his funeral and engaged in other activities.<\/p>\n<p>They emotionally write about this in the following words:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quoting Answering-Ansar:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It is common for a person to become the subject of stern condemnation and ridicule of he fails to attend a friend or relatives funeral. It can lead to friendships ending and families becoming divided because we will all die one day and it is expected that those closely linked to the deceased will attend. Relatives frequently fly thousands of miles to reach a deceased loved one&#8217;s funeral. Compare this to men who were close associates of the Holy Prophet (saaws). Rather than remain close to him and participate in his funeral they departed from the very room where his body was laid to rest, entered the debate at Saqifa, never looking back, never asking for proceedings to be delayed until after the funeral, they preferred the lengthy discussion of who will lead the Ummah than the funeral of the Leader of mankind. We would ask our readers to spare some time to these points. <u>Lest there remain any doubt over the events as described<\/u> by us we will shall quote the words of the Hanafi scholar, <em>Allamah Shibli Numani<\/em>:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>&#8220;It is apparently surprising that no sooner did the Prophet die than the struggle for Caliphate commenced and even the burial of the body of the Founder of Islam became a matter of secondary consideration in the quarrels that arose over the question of succession. Who can for a moment conceive the spectacle of the Prophet lying dead, while those who asserted their love and attachment towards him in his lifetime, without even waiting to look to his remains being suitably interred, were hurrying away to see that others did not secure the headship of the state for themselves!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>It is still more surprising that this act is attributed to the persons (Abu Bakr and Omar) who are the brightest stars of the Islamic firmament and the unpleasantness of the act becomes still more poignant when it is remembered that those persons who were connected with the Prophet by ties of blood and kinsmanship (&#8216;Ali and the Banu Hashim) were naturally affected by his death and the sad bereavement prostrated them with grief, which, coupled with their anxiety to perform the last offices to the dead, hardly left the room for ulterior considerations&#8221;.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121216084647\/http:\/\/www.answering-ansar.org\/answers\/saqifa\/al_farooq_v1_p85-86.jpg\" rel=\"external nofollow\">\u00a0Al Farooq, by Allamah Shibli Numani, translated by Maulana Zafar Ali Khan Vol 1 p 85-86<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">In the end what transpired at the Saqifa is astounding, even to the casual observer.
