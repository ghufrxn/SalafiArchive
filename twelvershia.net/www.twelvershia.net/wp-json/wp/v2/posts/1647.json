Ironically, upon investigation, it turned out that even this renowned supplication has questionable origins roots. Shi&#8217;ite scholars, however, are never outspoken about this reality simply because it would be devastating to the masses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even some of the more outspoken reformers, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muhammad_Asif_Muhsini\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Mohammad Asif Mohseni<\/a> in his Mashra\u2019at Al-Bihar (1\/405), couldn\u2019t openly dismiss and reject the ascription of this supplication to <em>Amir Al-Mu\u2019minin<\/em>. When commenting on the 118 narrations of the first chapter in the twenty third volume of Bihar Al-Anwar, Mohseni said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe authentic reports in this chapter are: 8, 9, 18, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 34 in a version, 35, 37, 41, 46, 54, 58, 62, 63, 65, 67, 68, 74, 75, 76, 77 in a version, 84, 86 in a version, 90, <strong>and the 91st narration which is though to have come from &#8216;Ali (as)<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is needless to say that Dua Kumayl is the 91st report in this chapter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few pages later, Mohseni proceeds to use even more doubtful language when explaining the report. Prior to explaining the text of of Dua Kumayl, he said: \u201cAssuming it was uttered by &#8216;Ali, it would mean&#8230;.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This suspicious language drove us to look further into the personality known as Kumayl b. Ziyad in order to discern his reliability in Shi&#8217;te biographical sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The earliest Shi&#8217;ite biographical source to mention anything about Kumayl b. Ziyad is Rijal Al-Barqi. On page 59, the author refered to him as Kumayl b. Ziyad Al-Nakha\u2019i. He listed him under a chapter titled: &#8220;The Companions [of Ali] from Yemen&#8221;. Nothing else is mentioned about this transmitter. It should also be noted that there is a difference of opinion regarding who is the actual author of Rijal Al-Barqi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second biographical source to mentioned Kumayl is Rijal Al-Tusi, which is a more authoritative book. Al-Tusi mentioned Kumayl b. Ziyad Al-Nakha\u2019i on two occasions. He is listed under the chapers: \u201cthose who narrated from Ali\u201d (p. 80) and \u201cthe companions of Al-Hasan b. Ali\u201d (p. 95).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no other mention of Kumayl in any early authoritative Shi&#8217;ite biographical <em>rijali<\/em> sources.\u00a0In other words, his reliability has not been endorsed, nor has it been negated. It is thus evident that Kumayl b. Ziyad was not a significant figure. It is also seems like his trademark &#8220;Dua Kumayl&#8221; only reached canon status around four centuries after his death, as one expect him to receive more attention from early Shi&#8217;ite biographical sources otherwise.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dua Kumayl&#8217;s Chain of Transmission<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The earliest and most reliable source that contains the isnads for Dua Kumayl is Al-Saduq\u2019s Kamal Al-Deen 1\/274-279.

They are not independent, and most of these chains of transmission converge to a single transmitter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To break things down, it is apparent that the common link in reports #2 \u2013 9 and 11 \u2013 13 is Abdulrahman b. Jundub Al-Fazzari. He\u00a0 is the primary transmitter of Dua Kumayl, yet he was not mentioned in any early biographical sources<em>.<\/em> According to Al-Jawahiri, in <em>Al-Mufid min Mu\u2019jam Rijal Al-Hadith\u00a0<\/em>(p. 309), he us unknown.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reports reports #1 and # 10 are transmitted through Fudhail b. Khadeej. He too was not mentioned in any early biographical sources, and he therefore is an obscure and unknown transmitter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The final report is the most problematic of them all, since it contains three unknown transmitters, Abdulrahman b. Musa Al-Barqi, Mohammad b. Al-Zayyat, and Abu Salih.<\/p>\n<p>Another noteworthy phenomenon in these reports is their conflicting transmission:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports #11 and #12 quote Lut b.

That is not what is expected of You,<\/p>\n<p>Nor what is well-known of Your bounty,<\/p>\n<p>Nor it is similar to the goodness and kindness Thou hast shown to those who profess Your Unity.<\/p>\n<p>So I declare with certainty that were it not for what You have decreed concerning the chastisement of Your deniers<\/p>\n<p>And what You have foreordained concerning the everlasting home of those who stubbornly resist,<\/p>\n<p>You would make the Fire, all of it, coolness and safety,<\/p>\n<p>And no one would have a place of rest or abode within it.<\/p>\n<p>But You \u2014holy are Your Names\u2014hast sworn that You will fill it with the unbelievers,<\/p>\n<p>Both Jinn and men together,<\/p>\n<p>And that You will place those who stubbornly resist therein forever.<\/p>\n<p>And You \u2014 majestic is Your eulogy\u2014 said at the beginning and were gracious through kindness as a favour,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Is he who has been believer like unto him who has been ungodly? They are not equal\u201d (32:18)<\/p>\n<p>My God and my Master!
