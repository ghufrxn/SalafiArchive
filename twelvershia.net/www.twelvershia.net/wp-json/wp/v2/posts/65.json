Although the time an average Shia layman spends with the book of Allah is much less than that spent by the average Muslim from Ahlul-Sunnah, this is because their scholars keep them occupied with Nauhas and Maatam and weeping for al-Hussein (ra) and reading Ziyarat and doing Latmiyat instead of reciting the book of Allah. This is an honest cry to warn the average Shia laymen from the dangers of the beliefs that their scholars hold on to, beliefs that led them away from the book of Allah and made them estranged from it, poisonous beliefs that must not creep into the hearts of the average Shia laymen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Introduction:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The one who is familiar with the beliefs of the Shia scholars\u00a0\u00a0towards the Quran, based on their narrations and the declarations of their scholars and teachers, will see that there is psychological barrier between them and the book of Allah, and that they have greatly distanced themselves from it. This is natural and inevitable, it is caused by the beliefs they have chosen to carry, and although they are divided into two teams when it comes to the preservation and protection of this book from Tahreef(corruption), yet this crisis towards the Quran affects both teams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You see the first team declaring a\u00a0negative position towards\u00a0the Quran, claiming that the evil hands have reached it and corrupted it, they claim that many of its verses were deleted and some changed. This team has saved us the time since they themselves declared that the book of Allah is not binding upon\u00a0them and they rejected it completely, placing a thick solid wall between themselves and the Quran, so it is no secret that they suffer from this crisis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the second team, it is they who have declared that the book is preserved and protected from additions or deletions, this is a positive position that leads the researcher to believe for a second that they are not affected by the crisis. Unfortunately, after reading this brief research one will see that the symptoms of this disease are deeply rooted into the belief system of this second team and it&#8217;s incumbent upon me to mention the origins of the problem and to clarify why it was unavoidable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chapter 1: Unveiling the disease causing the crisis towards the Quran.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The observer will realize quickly that the root of the disease in the Shia &#8216;Aqeedah is their belief in Imamah (divine appointment of Ahlul-Bayt as rulers) which in turn leads them to believe in the treachery of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS) in general and the first three rightly guided Caliphs in specific (Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar &amp; &#8216;Uthman may Allah be pleased with them) because they usurped the right of rulership that Allah had supposedly bestowed on the twelve Imams from the progeny of the Prophet (SAWS).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on this, the image of the companions in the eyes of those who have been breast fed Shia &#8216;Aqeedah is a dark and ugly image, because they believe that the companions betrayed that which Allah had entrusted\u00a0them with and did not offer the position of divine leadership to &#8216;Ali (ra) and his children but instead they oppressed them,\u00a0\u00a0tortured them, murdered them and forced them to give a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr (ra).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ones who have absorbed a great quantity of this Shia belief will most probably reach a stage\u00a0where they cannot even imagine that the companions are capable of doing anything positive in Islam. This is why you often see the Shia scholars doing their best to turn the smallest positive virtue or any good deed done by a companion into a crime and a negative act even if the opposite is clear.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I shall mention some examples below:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- The virtue of the emigration of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (ra) with the Prophet (SAWS):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a virtue that has been preserved\u00a0\u00a0by Allah in his eternal book when he said: {If you do not aid the Prophet &#8211; Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, &#8220;Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.&#8221; And Allah sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah &#8211; that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.} [Quran 9:40]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia scholars would put all their effort into turning this great virtue into a horrible crime, the Shia scholar and leader of their sect al-Tusi said in his book of Tafseer &#8220;al-Tibyan al-Jami&#8217;I li-&#8216;Uloum al-Quran&#8221; while commenting on the saying of Allah &#8220;He said to his companion: do not grieve&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;If this is not disparagement then it has no virtue in it, it is just a prohibition from being fearful&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meaning that these words vilify Abu Bakr (ra) or at least cannot be counted as a virtue. He continued when commenting on the saying of Allah &#8220;Indeed Allah is with us&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;What is meant here is only the Prophet (SAWS), but even if Abu Bakr was also included\u00a0then this is still not a virtue, it may be a threat to him, like the one who says to a man whom he sees doing an evil act: Don&#8217;t do it! Allah is with us! meaning Allah is watching over our actions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- The honor bestowed upon Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (ra) when the Prophet (SAWS) chose him to accompany him in the &#8220;&#8216;Arish&#8221; or the tower of command during battle:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nShia scholar Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr would transform this from virtue to criticism in his book &#8220;Fadak fi al-Tareekh&#8221; page 128:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I have no reasonable explanation for this other than him attempting to stand beside the Prophet (SAWS) to earn a position that is naturally the furthest point away from the battle-field and from danger (\u2026) We know from the methods of al-Siddeeq that he loved being beside the Prophet (SAWS) in wars because his position is the most protected where all the Islamic forces are concentrated to guard and defend him.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also said on page 125:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;A certain person (meaning Abu Bakr) who found it enough during the holy Jihad to stand\u00a0\u00a0in the last lines -al-&#8216;Arish-&#8220;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWe say in response to al-Sadr: And if we ignore\u00a0the fact that Abu Bakr (ra) remained there by orders of the Prophet (SAWS), I ask those whose eyes have been blinded by the darkness of hatred: When he had accompanied the Prophet (SAWS) in the cave and the Kouffar were searching for them to kill them as they stood right above their heads, was this the &#8220;furthest point possible from battle&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">{May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Quran 9:30]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on the above and based on the fact that they do not tolerate any virtue for the companions, let us discover what their position was regarding the biggest of all virtues achieved by the rightly guided Caliphs, the virtue of collecting the Quran we have in our hands today after the death of the prophet (SAWS), we need to discover their views regarding the book that was collected by the men whom they accused of the most hideous crimes and described with the worst of descriptions, the men whom they labeled as being traitors and betrayers of the divine command of God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Shia scholars will be faced with two choices here, the first choice:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To admit that they collected the Quran in a matter that pleases Allah and his Prophet (SAWS), and thus accept this as\u00a0a great historical virtue and that the entire nation would be thankful to them until the day of judgment for preserving and protecting the holy Quran. This is something that their hateful and vile souls shall never accept, because\u00a0of all the loathing and hatred they absorbed as a result of their belief in Imamah. Believing in such a virtue for them is worse than being struck with swords and stabbed with knives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An example of this, is that when one of their scholars wanted to defend the position that says that the Quran is Muharraf (corrupted), he stated that believing otherwise means that we think well of the Caliphs and have a good opinion of them, this directly opposes the base of their religion and their principals that state that the Caliphs were evil usurpers that betrayed the divine orders of God (Imamah). Shia scholar al-Muhaqqiq Yusuf al-Bahrani wrote in his book &#8220;al-Durar al-Najafiyah&#8221; 4\/83:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I swear, that in saying: &#8220;there is no corruption and change&#8221;, this is considered nothing more than thinking Well of the evil leaders, and that they did not betray the biggest and most important of things entrusted to us (Qur&#8217;an), although it is apparent to all that they betrayed the other important thing entrusted to us (Imamah) and the\u00a0latter is more harmful to the religion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can see above that the Shia scholar thinks that by betraying Imamah which he described as being more harmful to the religion, one must not be so na\u00efve as to think that they wouldn&#8217;t change and corrupt the Quran.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second choice:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To stick to their principals and turn this great virtue into a lowly despicable act by stating that the companions never collected the Quran properly in the manner that Allah had intended for it to be collected, and that they did this only to hide the truth that was revealed by the Prophet (SAWS) and to misguide the people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is evident to all those who have experience and are well informed about the ways of the Shia scholars, is that they will go for the second choice and this is why they started casting doubts on the book of Allah claiming that the way it was collected was wrong and that this wasn&#8217;t the collection\u00a0that pleases Allah and his Prophet (SAWS). They did this in two methods.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first method:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That the rightly guided Caliphs when collecting the Quran have corrupted it by deleting many verses that show the virtues of Ahlul-Bayt and their divine right of Imamah. This is the method of casting doubt on the entire Quran and it\u00a0was adopted by the Shia scholars who clearly declared the corruption of the Quran in form of deletion such as al-Qummi, al-&#8216;Ayyashi, al-Majlisi, Ni&#8217;imatullah al-Jazaeri, al-Noori al-Tabrasi and many others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second method:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That the rightly guided Caliphs when collecting the Quran did not corrupt it by deleting verses, instead they corrupted it by changing the order of verses and chapters and the way it is recited and deleting the explanation of the Prophet SAWS and the interpretation\u00a0of the verses or\u00a0words and the reasons for revelation. This method of casting doubt on the book of Allah was adopted by the Shia scholars that deny Tahreef in the form of deletion and addition and they are the subject of our research in this article.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chapter 2: Displaying some of the beliefs of their scholars who deny Tahreef openly but\u00a0push people away from the Quran.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We saw previously that this team of Shia scholars disagrees with the other team on the corruption of the Quran in form of addition or deletion but they agree with them on casting doubts on it and pushing people away from it because it was collected by the Caliphs. They would start casting doubts using hidden twisted ways so as to plant these doubts in the minds of all those who read their books thus alienating the Shia laymen from it and this way they hit two birds with one stone. They distance their followers from its teachings from one side, from another side they protect themselves from being accused of believing in the corruption of the Quran.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here I present a quick list of these beliefs:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- The Caliphs only collected the Quran when\u00a0&#8216;Ali(ra) came to them with the correct Quran that he had collected, after\u00a0checking its contents they rejected &#8216;Ali&#8217;s (ra) collection and made their own.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- The way the Muslims read or recite the Quran today is not the way that pleases Allah, it is different from it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- The Quran collected by &#8216;Ali (ra) and rejected by the Caliphs contains the explanation of the Prophet (SAWS) to the verses and the causes\u00a0for revelation of each verse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4- The Quran collected by the Caliphs is different than that of &#8216;Ali (ra) in terms of order of chapters and verses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- The Quran collected by &#8216;Ali (ra) has acquired miraculous power and all matter of perfection and accuracy in compilation as opposed to the one spread all over the world today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- The Quran of &#8216;Ali (ra) that the 12th hidden Imam al-Mahdi shall reveal is a new Quran, different than the one the Muslims are used to because of its miraculous power and difference in interpretation and accuracy and the perfection of its collection.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now we shall discuss these &#8216;Aqaed one by one, starting with the first one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The first belief:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Caliphs collected the Quran after &#8216;Ali (ra) came to them with the correct Quran that he had collected, after checking its contents they rejected &#8216;Ali&#8217;s (ra) collection and made their own.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The leader of the Shia Muhaddiths (Scholars of Hadith) ibn Babaweih al-Qummi whom they call al-Saduq says in one of the most important Shia books of &#8216;Aqaed &#8220;Kitab al-I&#8217;itiqadat fi Deen al-Imamiyah&#8221; pg.86:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[ Ameer al-Mumineen (as) had collected it, and when he brought it to them, he said: &#8220;This is the book of your Lord as it was revealed on your Prophet, without any added or removed letters.&#8221; They said: &#8220;We have no need for it, we have one like the one you have.&#8221; so he left while reciting: {But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price.

So why did they do this? what was their objective? I had told you that one lecture was not enough. The order of chapters and the order of verses is different than how it was originally revealed, take for example the verse of al-Mawaddah (Quran 42:23) it was placed in a location other than its original location, the Verse of al-Tathir (Quran 33:33) it was also placed in a location other than its original location, the chapter of al-Maedah (5th chapter) according to the consensus of Muslims this is the last chapter revealed, you will see that it is not at the end but at the beginning of the Quran.
