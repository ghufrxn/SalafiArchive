(See Saheeh Al-Bukhari #4384 and #4687.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words, if we were to authenticate the narration provided by SlaveOfAhlubait, then we would have to reconcile the two narrations by holding the view that the marriage was not consummated and that she was still a virgin when she married the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; .<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ironically, the view that A\u2019isha was married off as a virgin to the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him &#8211; is the position of the top Shia scholars throughout history, like Al-Tusi in Al-Mabsoot 4\/270 and Al-Tabrasi in I\u2019lam Al-Wara 1\/276. With this in mind, it is strange for SlaveOfAhlubait to hold the view that is suggested by an odd Sunni narration, while rejecting the views of his top scholars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait \u201cAyesha divorced before Marriage to Holy Prophet (asws) as per Imam of Ahlu Sunnah?\u201d The article can be found on his blog and on the Wilayat website.
