However, we could not locate this tradition in that book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n2- Narration of Ibn Asakir in Tareekh Dimashq through the path of Abu Sa\u2019eed Al-Khudari. The narration is very weak since it comes through Ahmad bin Salim, who was accused of lying and stealing narrations. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n3- Narration of Ibn Asakir in Tareekh Dimashq through the path of Jabir is weak since it comes through the path of Ibrahim bin Anas, and the scholars of hadith did not write a biography for him, which makes him an anonymous narrator.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n4- The narration of Abu Barza through the path of Al-Hasakani comes through the narration of Husain bin Mukhariq who has been accused of fabricating hadiths. See Lisan Al-Mizan. The narration also includes other narrators that seem to be anonymous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n5- The narration of Al-Baqir in Tafseer Al-Tabari comes from the path of Abu Al-Jarood the Zaidi, who has been weakened and accused of lying by many scholars include Abu Hatim, Abu Zur\u2019ah, and Yahya bin Ma\u2019een.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n6- The narration of Ibn Mardawayh through Ali in his tafseer. No chain has been provided for this narration, and therefore, it is rejected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n7- The narration in Shawahid Al-Tanzeel from Muqatil does not include a chain, and is therefore rejected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n8- Another narration from Shawahid Al-Tanzeel through the path of Ali contains more than one anonymous narrator. It also includes Isma\u2019eel bin Ziyad, who seems to be the narrator that is accused of lying by the early hadith scholars. See his biography in Lisan Al-Mizan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Section 2: Shia Sources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Tafseer Al-Qummi \u2013 Murtadha Al-Askari weakens the authenticity of the attribution of this book to Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Qummi. It seems that he has done this because the book is full of narrations that support the view that the Qur\u2019an has been tampered with. He says, \u201cSo who is the person that is saying Abu Al-Fadhl bin Al-Abbas told me? Is it the author himself? And who is Abu Al-Fadhl Al-Abbas? Is he the same student? Is the author narrating from his student? And upon this we say that it is an anonymous person narration from an anonymous person and we don\u2019t know the truth of the matter.\u201d See Al-Qur\u2019an Al-Kareem wa Riwayat Al-Madrisatain 3\/60. Mohammad Asif Muhsini holds the same view. See the introduction of his Mashra\u2019ah.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n2- Tafseer Furat \u2013 Furat Al-Kufi himself is an anonymous narrator according to Murtadha Al-Askari. See Al-Qur\u2019an Al-Kareem wa Riwayat Al-Madrisatain 3\/61.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, as we can see from the study above, there is not a single authentic narration in either Sunni nor Shia sources that these verses have been revealed for Ali\u2019s Shia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The following is a response to SlaveOfAhlubait\u2019s article entitled: \u201cKhair ul Bariyya.\u201d The article can be found here.
