					<description><![CDATA[Good example. But can we also not make another  few of points here.
1) Why did Fatima RA went out to claim the property in the first place when it was taken away ? Why would she show her resentment and deliver an hour long Khutba against the Caliph as narrated by Shia Books if Ahlulbait do not take back or wish to take back what has been taken away from them ? But we see she set out to claim and get all back what she supposed was taken away from her.
2) Why  Ali RA accepted Khilaafa after people approached him after killing Usman RA as it was taken away from him from day 1 ? As ahlulBait do not take back whats been taken away from them regardless of who offers them back, themselves or anyone else
3) Why Hussian RA set out for Kufa to claim Khilafa which was taken away from their family according to shia ? As we are told that Ahlulbait donot take back anything which is taken away from them. Why would he leave Madina and sacrifice all his family memebers for his right of Khilafa ?
