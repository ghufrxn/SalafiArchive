Obviously the other two will be discarded. The contention revolves around the other two sources tampering with the original to fit in with their understanding. Much more to come of this, but for now, please read Macisaac&#039;s article: http://www.twelvershia.net/2017/02/19/3889/]]></description>

Also, your suggestion that these are scribal &quot;errors&quot; are simply not plausible. 

The words used:
اثنان 2 ثلاثة 3 أربعة 4
do not look anything alike. One does not simply make an &quot;accident&quot; like that. The reality is the these were purposefully changed in order to fit the understanding of whomever copied them.]]></description>

Scribal errors can be in minor things, not in the main tenet of Twelverism which is that Imams are 12. This narration was altered more than once by several scholars, al-Tusi as well I recall. You&#039;d be surprised that some of al-`Askari&#039;s Shia believed his son was called &quot;`Ali&quot; not &quot;Muhammad&quot;, many didn&#039;t think he&#039;s the seal of Imams and believed he&#039;d return and have children to continue the lineage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam.

Al-Karajiki quoting from Al-Mufeed who in turn quoted from Al-Kulayni then I assume that inconsistencies may be due to scribal error. In this case only Al-Kafi is the original source and it is reasonable that original source be followed.

- We shias believe from Hadhrat Fatima al-Zahra (s.a) children (who are awsiya) 3 are Mohammed and 3 are Ali
- We shias believe in 12 awsiya where 3 are Mohammed and 4 are Ali
- We shia believe in al-Qaim (a.s) besides whom there are awsiya where 2 are Mohammed and 4 are Ali]]></description>
