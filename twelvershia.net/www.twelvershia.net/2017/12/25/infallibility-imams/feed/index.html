					<description><![CDATA[In Name of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA, THE MOST GRACIOUS, THE MOST MERCIFUL.

Dear brother, 

As-Salamu Aleikum wa Rahmatul LLAAH.

Bi Idhnil LLAAHI TA&#039;ALA,

I am a devout Muslim and an Islamic Theologian and Researcher.
I am neither Sunni nor Shia, just a Muslim who follows the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of our Master, Hazrat Muhammad (saw).

Though I tespect all Islamic Schools of Fiqh, namely the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi, Twelver Shia, Zaydi Shia and Ibadi, I follow none.

The Holy Quran and the Sunnah that matches with the Holy Quran, suffice for every muslim.

Being the Last Message of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA to all Mankind, The Holy Quran has to be properly translated so non arabs as well as arabs can understand the Word of ALLAH Subhana HU wa TA&#039;ALA.
Other Islamic Schoolars like me say the same thing. It is sufficient to mention two:
—dr Zakir Naik;
— dr Bilal Philips

In English, one has excelent Translations of the Meanings of the Holy Quran, namely:
— The Translation made in Saudi Arabia by Muhsin Khan and Hilali;
— The Translation made by Abdullah Yussuf Ali;
— The Translation made by Talal Itani;
— The Translation made by Saheeh International;
— the Translation made by Abdulmajid Daryabadi;
— the Translation made by Ali Quli Qara&#039;i;
— the Translation made by Shakir;
— &quot;The Study Quran&quot;, which is a Translation made by a group of Schoolars and supervised by Sayyid Hussein Nasr.

These are the ones I know. They are very very very close to the Original Arabic.

There are other English Translations of the Holy Quran, but I can say nothing about them because I haven&#039;t analised them.

If one reads the Holy Quran in Arabic without understanding Arabic, this is very good and the reciter will have his reward from ALLAH TA&#039;ALA.

But if one reads the Translation of the Meanings of the Holy Quran in one&#039;s native tongue, provided that the Translation is good and meets all Islamic Criteria, then reading the Translation will bring much more (and I want to emphasize the words much more) reward to the reciter than reading in Arabic without understanding this language.
This Truth is also supported by Dr Zakir Naik.

Now, regarding the matter of this text, I would like to remind the readers that the Salafi Muslims (also known as Wahabis) are the only Muslim Communitty that ascribes Hands, Feet and Face to ALLAH TA&#039;ALA, going against the Holy Words of ALMIGHTY ALLAH, when HE (SWT) says:
— There is nothing like HIM (Holy Quran, Surah 42, Ayah 11);
— do not associate anything with HIM (Holy Quran, Surah 6, Ayah 151).

There are countless Passages in the Holy Quran like this, that describe The ABSOLUTE TRANSCENDENCE OF ALLAH TA&#039;ALA.

But the Salafi Muslims will tell you that ALLAH has face, hands and feet, but nothing resembles them.
The simple fact of ascribing Hands, feet and Face to ALLAH TA&#039;ALA is associating ALLAH TA&#039;ALA with HIS creation. 
When the Salafi Muslims say that ALLAH TA&#039;ALA has hands, feet and face, they are resembling ALLAH TA&#039;ALA to HIS Creation even if this resemblance has the size of an Atom!!

The Salafi Muslims fail to realise that the EMINENCE, TRANSCENDENCE AND ABSOLUTENESS OF ALLAH TA&#039;ALA IS SUCH, that there are no words to describe HIM, THE MOST HIGH, THE SUPREME.
So ALLAH TA&#039;ALA uses metaphors in the Holy Quran like Hands, in order for people to have the Knowledge of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA that ALLAH TA&#039;ALA wants them to have.
So, when in the last Verse Surah Ya Sin, ALLAH TA&#039;ALA says that everything is in HIS Hands, the meaning is that ALLAH TA&#039;ALA has Absolute Control of HIS Creation.
During the times of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw), there was no need to explain the meanings of the &quot;Hands&quot;, &quot;Feet&quot; and &quot;Face&quot; of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA, because the Arabs knew that these passages had a metaphorical meaning.

ALLAH TA&#039;ALA IS SO EMINENT that HE IS INCOMPARABLY ABOVE all HIS Names!! But HE ordered HIS Creation to abide by these Holy Names and not go beyond them.

That is why Hazrat Abu Huraira (ra) said that Rassulullah (saw) gave him two kinds of Knowledge and Abu Hurraira only showed one kind and said that if he showed the Mystical Knlwlwdge, people would kill him, wrongly thinking that Abu Huraira was an Infidel!!

I, as a Muslim and as an Imam Myself, if necessary, pray behind a Shia Imam, a Hanafi Imam, a Hanbali Imam, a Shafee Imam, a Zaydi Imam, a Salafi Imam, and any Muslim Imam that does not associate anything with ALLAH TA&#039;ALA and believes Muhammad (saw) to be the last Prophet and Messenger of ALLAH TA&#039;ALA.

There are Shias and Sunnis that exagerate. The former about Imam Ali (as). The later about Rassulullah (saw). This is wrong and some of them even do Xirk!!
Many Sunnis worship the Shrines of Muslim Saints. This is Xirk and the Saints themselves never taught Xirk and were the most pious people of their times.

But the majority of Shias and Sunnis and Salafis are good muslims and abide by the Quran and the Sunnah.
