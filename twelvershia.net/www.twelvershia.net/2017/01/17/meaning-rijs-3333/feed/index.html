you mean that this chpater means that allah first didnt want to do anything about the ahulbayt and his opinion &quot;changed&quot; and dicided to clean tham?!! well as far as I know that is kufr. because allah knows every thing from past to future so his opinions dont change and thats a weakness for him if it changes .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ALLAh says&#039;&#039; ALLAH wishes to remove from you impurity &#039;&#039;. 
Most important question is that what impurities were there that ALLAH wishes to remove ? First Shia had to explain those impurities which they (5 ahlulbayt ) carried that ALLAH intended to remove. By the verse we have to admit that it is about people who were ordinary humans with impurity of sins or doubts whatever we call it and ALLAH wished to remove that all. But we see according to Shia their Imams are born Masoom or infallible. This verse infact poses a very difficult challenge for all shia. Are they ready to accept that their 3 Imams and Fatima RA were with some impurities until ALLAH showed an intention or wish to remove that. Of course if their was no impurity in the first place their is no point talking about an intention to remove it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pace be on the ones that follow the guidance, So from what you have here of this explanation you are telling us that The Ahlul Bayt was clear from all doubts about they Lord, so Allah have given them the firm pillar of Imaan more than any other because no other got that Rijs removed so i as a logical person will see that they are the firmest of people on Religion So if i was a leader of A nation i will leave them as my successors ...... But i know you all believe in the Shura of Saqifa and such but no problem to Allah we will all return!
