The actions of Omar indicate that he had no idea that the Prophet&#039;s (peace be upon him) death was near. This is evident in his reaction to the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him). There is no evidence that suggests that he knew of a close death.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see a slight contradiction that I&#039;m hoping you can clear up for me.  The Hadith you quoted stated at the end that &quot; And by Allah, I feel that Allah’s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death.&quot;  

Then you go on to later say &quot; Little did they know that his health would not improve and that he would pass away a few days later.&quot; 

It&#039;s clear from the Hadith that at least two people knew that prophet peace be upon him would die which means that Omar most likely knew he was also going to die(  although this is speculation, I believe it&#039;s highly probable).

Thank you.]]></description>
