					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2017/01/29/marriage-known-al-misyar-according-shia/#comment-29390&quot;&gt;Hussayn al-Hanafi&lt;/a&gt;.

Salam,

As mentioned in the article, this is a brief piece that&#039;s not intended to go into details. You notice that not every condition placed has the same weight though, scholars had issues with certain &quot;conditions&quot; and I do recall reading that some said exactly what you did above and refused this condition.

I give you examples, our mother Sawda (as) became really old of age and could not fulfill certain marital duties, she became fearful that the Prophet (saw) would let go of her due to this, so she offered him her night that he (saw) may spend it with another. In her mind she probably thought this is a better situation since she would like to remain a mother of believers alongside the Prophet (saw).

Another example, a rich widow who is too old to fulfill a husband&#039;s sexual desires. She does not wish to remain alone in her old age so she accepts being a second wife and drops her turn, offering her night to her husband to spend it with the other wife. In this case, a man may weigh things down in his head and commit to her.

God knows best but this is all present in Islamic society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salam alaykum,

Is it possible to clarify regarding the &#039;sexual intercourse&#039; portion, since it would be attacking the very reason for a marriage (which is for both sides to fulfill their lusts within the Shariah). Are the authors certain about this particular issue, since the quotations seem to be somewhat hurried and we can say superficial. Wa Allahu A&#039;lam.]]></description>
