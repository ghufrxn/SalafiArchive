Please produce an alleged authentic hadith from the work of Al-Mahouzi (who has his own rijali standards that goes against the standards of all Shia scholars).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, the narrators which you said are weak are debatable. There is a book by sheikh mahuzi, titled  Forty Hadiths considering the text on the twelve imams by their names, where he gives sahih hadith and also discusses. Another point, the number of hadiths mentioning the names of the 12 imams are mutawatir so the isnad does not become important. Finally, the argument is flawed. If we accept that there is no authentic hadith mentioning the 12 imams by name, we can still work out who the  12 imams are by looking at the hadiths which specifically mention each imam being designated and appointed.]]></description>
