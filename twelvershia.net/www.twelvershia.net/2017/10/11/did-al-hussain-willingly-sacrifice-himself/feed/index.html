There are definitely a couple of stories of Zaynab and Zayn-ul-`Abidin criticizing their Shia. I doubt the stories related to Zaynab have any authentic chains. It requires research.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salaam. I want to know the post-Karbala events. What does authentic Sunni &#038; Shia reports say about Female Relatives &#038; Companions of Imam Hussain (a.s)? Were Hadhrat Zainab (s.a) and her Female Companions tortured and marched bareheaded from Karbala to Syria as Prisoners of War? At at the court of Yazid what Speech did Hadhrat Zainab (s.a) and her nephew Imam Ali (a.s) ibn Hussain (a.s) give? 

I am asking this because in many Majalis (Religious gatherings) Shia Speakers say Hadhrat Zainab (s.a) and her nephew Imam Ali (a.s) ibn Hussain (a.s) gave the reason for Imam Hussain&#039;s (a.s) sacrifice for Islam and exposed the wicked intentions and plans of Yazid for eliminating Islam as Yazid did not believe that any revelation came down on Prophet Mohammed (s.a.w.w) nor was he (s.a.w.w) bestowed with Prophet-hood but that it was a game played by Banu Hashims to establish their monarchy.]]></description>
