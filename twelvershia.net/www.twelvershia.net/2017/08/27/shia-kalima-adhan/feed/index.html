					<description><![CDATA[we know that according to Imam Bukhari and other sunni scholars of hadith , it has no harm while speaking in the adhan. so on this basis if some one utter these words ali un wali Allah in adhan without taking these as part of adhan. what is your opinion?]]></description>

The early leader of the Shia al-Saduq admits this as quoted above. The biggest evidence is that Muslims don&#039;t have this in their Adhan, only this sect adds it and they happen to be extreme supporters of `Ali.]]></description>

1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I used to give the adhaan for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the first adhaan of Fajr I used to say: “Hayya ‘ala al-falaah, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god but Allaah).” 

Narrated by Abu Dawood, 500; al-Nasaa’i, 647; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question.
If the Adhan were an INTEGRAL part of Islam, why didn&#039;t Allah mention the words in Quran.
And secondly, Adhan is &#039;a call&#039; to prayer. If you even stand on your house roof and start calling some people for some task, you will be giving out &#039;adhan&#039; for that specific task.  
Do we have an authentic reference as to what EXACTLY should be the words in adhan for salaat??]]></description>
