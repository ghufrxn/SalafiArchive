					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating!!. However, i think that when we Sunnis say &#039;the report is weak&#039;, i think what goes through the mind of a shia generally is &#039;they just call it weak because they dont like Ahlul Bayt and want to demote their status, so their evil muhadithun called it weak but it is in fact very strong&#039;. I am fully aware that the reality of the matter is the opposite, but i am 90% sure that that is how a Shia feels/thinks. If you really want to convince a Shia to NOT use weak reports, i think it would be a really effective technique to write an article where you use weak reports to make up an aqeedah for an imaginary sect, whose beliefs are in direct contradiction to the twelver theology. You can call this imaginary sect whatever, and make up a belief that directly conflicts with their(twelver shia) belief. For example, you can make up an imaginary sect called Umariya or something who believe that it is ONLY the descendants of Umer(RA) that should rule over the muslim world. You can call that article &#039;a theoretical exercise in making up different aqeedah using selective weak reports&#039; or something along those lines. The goal would be to show that if they want to rely on weak reports to PROVE their aqeedah, than some other sect can use weak reports to PROVE their OWN aqeedah that DIRECTLY CONFLICTS with their aqeedah. There is no such thing as a free meal in this world. Lastly, I really liked the diagrams for the chains as well. Made the information easier to digest. Keep up the good work!]]></description>
