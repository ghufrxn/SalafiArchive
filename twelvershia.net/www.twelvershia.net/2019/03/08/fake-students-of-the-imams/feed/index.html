That exactly is the point of this article.

This problem stems from later Twelver biographical sources, and it has nothing to do with these transmitters, as they perhaps never claimed to be the direct students of the Imams.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a little confused. Why wouldn&#039;t the fake students simply transmit from their teachers directly? in the end they couldnt be caught right? For example, suppose there is a teacher A who I want to attribute fake hadith to. So i would just say &quot;my teacher A said this&quot; and no one would know. So, why would these fake students not just lie and claim &#039;i heard it from teacher A directly&#039;? Would that not be a better way to attribute false hadith to a teacher instead of making up a chain that goes to their teacher A through an intermediary?]]></description>
