					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twelvershia.net/2019/03/12/analysis-of-hadith-ali-is-the-most-knowledgeble-from-my-ummah/#comment-33140&quot;&gt;Ijtaba&lt;/a&gt;.

Mu&#039;adh died in 17 AH, while Abu Hurayrah and &#039;Aisha died in 57 AH (4 decades after Mu&#039;adh). This obviously gave them greater exposure to later tabi&#039;in and a much more significant opportunity to disseminate Prophetic traditions.

I&#039;m not interested in entertaining any more idiocy that is not related to the hadith discussed in the article. 

If you have anything to say regarding my analysis, please go ahead. Otherwise, please do not waste your (and our) time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The reason for asking the question was not for competition but to know the person having most knowledge of Prophetic hadiths. Stop assuming things - you don&#039;t know about people&#039;s intention.

It&#039;s obvious that people would go to most knowledge person of the time in order to learn from him - What is the reason that hadiths narrated by Muadh is few? Whereas on the other hand hadiths narrated by Abu Hurayrah and Aisha are numerous. If those 1400 years old dead people hadn&#039;t transferred their knowledge to Ummah then people would had lost Prophetic teachings. GOD takes away knowledge from the earth by death of scholars. It is important for scholars to transfer their knowledge to people so that ignorance and biddah does not replace Sunnah.]]></description>

The following report is exponentially stronger than the fabrication that was analyzed in this article:

https://sunnah.com/urn/736740

Similarly, I would also ask you:

So what?

It&#039;s kind of pathetic how some try to rank the Sahabah in knowledge, even though they&#039;ve been dead for 1400 years. 
It&#039;s not a competition.]]></description>
