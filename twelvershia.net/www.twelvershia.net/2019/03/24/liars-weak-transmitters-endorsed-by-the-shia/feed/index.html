					<description><![CDATA[This article is more deadly to the rafidah than rat poison is to rodents. An EXCELLENT strike below the belt. Keep hitting those shia hadith sciences and dont stop until you have investigated every nook and cranny of it. I have personally found that when you disconnect Shiaism, from the real historical Ahlul Bayt(just like with Christian-Muslim debates, Christians are more receptive to Islam when Paul is disassociated from Jesus), the common shia layman is much more receptive to Islam(sunnism). Also, they are completely dumbstruck and usually dont know how to respond, because it is barely covered anywhere on Shiapen or RTS. I was debating this one imbecile on facebook, and all i wanted to do was to just give him a general idea of how hadith authentication works, which is mainly through corroboration. I sent him the &#039;In Defense of Hadith Methdology&#039; book from the islamic discourse initiative website. Basically my end goal was to show that Najashi and Tusi&#039;s endorsement is based on absolutely nothing whereas the Sunni muhadithun were very transparent about why they declared someone as a liar or weak. This idiot Shia convert from Sunnism literally outright REFUSED to even touch the book. He literally panicked and kept making stupid excuses like &#039;i have quotes from your scholars where they downgraded a shia just for being a shia&#039; blah blah blah. And i kept telling him that although muhadithun are subject to biases, the main method through which they authenticate content is through corroboration from other students of the same teacher. if something is not corroborated by others students, that is a huge red flag. I think deep down he knew he was in hot waters and didnt want to go there so he made up excuses. In Summary, it was an excellent article so keep at it!.]]></description>
