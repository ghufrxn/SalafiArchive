Really appreciate the feedback.

The thing is: the concept of Taqiyyah can be evaluated in light of various logical fallacies depending on how it is employed. In this article, we specifically addressed the usage of Taqiyyah by Twelver scholarship to deflect evidence that undermines their conception of the Imams&#039; teachings/beliefs.

With that being said, the Liar paradox certainly is relevant to discussions on Taqiyyah, and perhaps we can write an article on this in the near future, God-willing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though this is a very well written article, i personally would have used the liar paradox in philosophy as an example. I made a post about this in the Sunni-Shia Global debate group on facebook. Below is my post, which in my humble opinion, conveys the circular nature of the concept of taqiyah better.

&quot;
In logic and philosophy, there is something called ‘The Liar’ paradox. Basically it demonstrates that if a person is a truthful liar, than nothing he says can be verified and it is inherently self contradictory. For example, If a person A is a truthful liar, and he says ‘I am lying’, but we know that the person is truthful, and if he says, ‘I am telling the truth’, but we know that the person is a liar. You see the problem. Christianity suffers from the same nonsense. Jesus is both human and divine, both labels are completely contradictory to each other. Whenever a verse shows Jesus as human, the Christian claim that is also divine. It is a mess of circular reasoning and mind numbing contradiction. The shia concept of imams using taqiya also suffers from the exact same problem. Whenever the imams says something that agrees with Sunni theology and fiqh, an ad hoc rationalization of the shias is that the imams were doing this with taqiya. But the problem with that logic is how do you know that the imams were doing taqiyah?, how do you know that the imams were not doing taqiyah OF THEIR OWN taqiyah. We can clearly see that this stupid logic leads to circular reasoning. Thank Allah, we Ahlus Sunnah are free from this. The imams narrate a lot of content form our books and it is free from the circular reasoning of taqiyah.

1.In Wasa’il Al-Shia, Al-Hurr Al-Ameli quoted an authentic report from Qurb Al-Isnad, which its author transmitted from:
Harun b. Muslim, from Mas’adah b. Ziyad, from Ja’far (as), from his father:
Ali never used to ascribe any of his enemies to shirk or hypocrisy. Rather, he used to say: “They are our brothers who have transgressed against us.”‘
Al-Hurr Al-Ameli commented saying: “This is interpreted according to Taqiyyah.”
(Al-Ameli 15/83)

2.In Al-Istibsar, Al-Tusi said:
Regarding what has been transmitted by ‘Ali b. Ibrahim, from his father, from Muhammad b. Yahya, from Ghiyath b. Ibrahim, from Ja’far, from his father (as) that he said: “One must not prostrate on anything that is not touched by his entire body during sujud.”
Al-Tusi commented: “It does not conflict with the two previous reports because this report is in-line with the position of the ‘Ammah (Sunnis); thus, its interpretation is that it was said as Taqiyyah…” (Al-Tusi 1:335)

3. In Al-Istibsar, Al-Tusi said:
Al-Husayn b. Sa’id b. Fudalah, from Al-‘Alaa, from Muhammad b. Muslim, from Abu Ja’far (as): “My father, at home, used to call for prayer saying: الصلاة خير من النوم. You should not have a problem if you repeat that.”
Al-Tusi commented: “These reports are interpreted according to Taqiyyah, since the sect has unanimously agreed to neglect acting upon them.

Who is better? Those who laid the foundations of their building on righteousness and the quest for Allah’s approval; or those who did so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into the fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.[Quran 9:109]
