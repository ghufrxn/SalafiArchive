However, if possible, could you please publish a a few more people under the point &#039;9.The Arbitrary Endorsement of Forgers and Weak Transmitters in Shi’ite Sources&#039;, of people who are in their books and our books and who are declared liars by our scholars and considered trustworthy by their scholars. Keep up the good work!]]></description>
