Dear Shi&#039;ite,
I would be grateful if you could actually understand the argument in the article before attempting to reproduce a semi-coherent response
Your appeal to &quot;rekat of Namaz&quot; is self-defeating, since the concept of Salah is well-established in the Quran. The Quran informs us ofvarious details about Salah:

1. Details of Wudu prior to Salah [Al-Ma&#039;idah:6]
2. The command to uphold Salah, which can be found in tens of verses
3. The role of prayer in a Muslim&#039;s life
4. Friday Prayer [Al-Jumu&#039;ah:11]
5. Qiyam Al-Layl
6. The methodology of Prayer during warfare [Al-Nisa&#039;: 101-102]
7. The concept of prayer timings [Al-Nisa&#039;: 103]
8. The Qiblah during prayer [Al-Baqarah:144]

So you cannot tell me with a straight face that the Quran does not establish prayer in a detailed manner. The fact that the number of Rak&#039;as was not mentioned is irrelevant to the actual point, which is that the concept of prayer is extremely well-attested to in the Quran, UNLIKE Imamah. A person who reads the Quran will have a good understanding of the concept of prayer, while someone who reads the Quran will have ZERO understanding of the concept of Imamah according to the Twelver sect, let alone the Imamah of &#039;Ali b. Abi Taleb.

I&#039;m not interested in further wasting my time with irrelevant appeals, but if you do have an actual response to the argument made in the article, please be my guest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wilyah of Ali (as) is said by our last beloved prophet during Al Ghadir and mentioned in Quran and accepted by all companion, everything are mentioned in Quran but tafseer of ayat should be understandable on context of authentic hadees and life of our prophet, for that we have to understand prophet hadith and Sunnah, if you search rekat of Namaz you dont find there in Quran but we know how many Rekats Prophet (sa) do, So there are no worth and logic about your claim to prove it by Quran and two others (bible the book is not authentic)]]></description>
