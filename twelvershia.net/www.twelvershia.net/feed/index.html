<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen (Revision: 1.0.0)</p>



<p>It is mentioned in the work <em>‘Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen’</em> found on Answering-Ansar:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>It’s also written that Yaqoob held his brother feet’s in mercy, and when he had power he fought with GOD. (God Forbid)<br><br>These absurd accounts of GOD, can only be deemed to be fairy tales, Allah (swt) is all above all of these attributes, that the Jews and Christians have sought to ascribe to Him. Sadly if we examine Islam we will find that these same absurd beliefs are prevalent amongst the vast bulk of Islamic Sects, they believe that Allah (swt) has a physical body like humans have, that He (swt) has for e.g. Blood, Ears, Hands, legs etc. We read in <em>‘Al Milal wa al Nahal’</em> by Imam of Ahl’ul Sunnah Abdul Kareem Sharastani that Abu Dawood Zuhri and his followers adhered to this type of belief.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_usool_5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.answering-ansar.org/fiqh/usool_al_deen/en/chap3.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Shi&#8217;a Usool al-Deen</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.answering-ansar.org/fiqh/usool_al_deen/en/chap3.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This work, in actuality, is the English translation of Answering-Ansar’s mentor `Abd al-Karīm Mushtāq’s book, <em>Uşūl-i Dīn</em>, published and promoted&nbsp;on Answering-Ansar with additional notes.</p>



<p>However, it should be known that there is no one by the name of “Abu Dawood Zuhri.” This, in fact, is a result of the Answering-Ansar team’s lack of knowledge about major Islamic scholars because Mushtāq himself has mentioned the name in his original work as “Abū Dāwūd al-Žāhirī.” But ignorance is not limited to a single individual when it comes to <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> pseudo-polemicists, for he is Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd ibn `Alī al-Işfahānī al-Žāhirī (d. 275), not Abū Dāwūd as mentioned by Mushtāq.</p>



<p>Now, the question is, did Muĥammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm al-Shahrastānī (d. 548) state or relate that al-Žāhirī believed Allāh (swt) has a human-like physical body in <em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>?</p>



<p><strong>No</strong>, this is an outright lie.</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, al-Shahrastānī clearly states the complete opposite about al-Žāhirī in <em>al-Milal</em>. He says:</p>



<p>فأما أحمد بن حنبل وداود بن علي الاصفهاني وجماعة من أئمة السلف فجروا على منهاج السلف المتقدمين عليهم من أصحاب الحديث مثل مالك بن أنس ومقاتل بن سليمان وسلكوا طريق السلامة فقالوا نؤمن بما ورد به الكتاب والسنة ولا نتعرض للتأويل بعد أن نعلم قطعاً أن الله عز وجل لا يشبه شيئاً من المخلوقات وأن كل ما تمثل في الوهم فإنه خالقه ومقدوره وكانوا يحترزون عن التشبيه إلى غاية أن قالوا من حرك يده عند قراءة قوله تعالى خلقت بيدي أو أشار بإصبعيه عند روايته قلب المؤمن بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن وجب قطع يده وقلع إصبعيه</p>



<p><strong>“As for Aĥmad ibn Ĥanbal, <u>Dāwūd ibn `Alī al-Işfahānī</u> and a group&nbsp;of <em>Imāms</em>&nbsp;from the predecessors, they took the methodological course of the early predecessors from the people of narrations—such as Mālik ibn Anas and Muqātil ibn Sulaymān—and followed the safe path.</strong></p>



<p><strong>They said: ‘We believe in whatever is mentioned in the Book and the <em>Sunna</em>, and we do not come to grips with the interpretation; after we certainly know that Allāh, the Powerful and Exalted, <u>does not resemble anything from the creation</u> and that all what is portrayed in imagination is created and foreordained.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>And they used to <u>guard themselves from anthropomorphism</u> to such a degree, that they said: ‘Whosoever moved his hand during the recitation of </strong><strong>His statement: <em>‘…I created with My hands?’</em> [38:75] or pointed with his two fingers during his narration: ‘The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the Merciful,’ his hand should be cut and his two fingers removed.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm al-Shahrastānī (d. 548), volume 1, page 104 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>It is clear from the quote above that al-Shahrastānī does not state that al-Žāhirī believed Allāh (swt) has a human-like body or anything to that effect, but he rather states that al-Žāhirī was against anthropomorphism.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that Mushtāq—whose dishonesty has been uncovered <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216084635/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">earlier</a> as well—has lied about <em>al-Milal wa al-Niĥal</em>. This evidently demonstrates how truthful and reliable is the information promoted in the works of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> propagandists, and particularly on Answering-Ansar.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt)&nbsp;who gives success, and blessings and peace be on the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Mu&#8217;awiya (Revision: 4.0.0)</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has a tendency to deliberately cite several non-<em>Sunnī</em> texts under the pretext of “Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah&#8217;s esteemed” works. These works are citied in lengthy lists in order to support the claims on Answering-Ansar and are presented as authoritative <em>Sunnī</em> texts. One of these works is <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em>.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar writes in the fourth revised edition of their article entitled <em>‘Mu&#8217;awiya’</em>:</p>

<p>As it is clear from the quotes above, the Answering-Ansar team claims the following about <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Its author is a <em>Sunnī</em> scholar.</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is an “esteemed” <em>Sunnī</em> text.</li>
</ul>



<p>The verity of both of these claims will become clear to the readers once they know who the author is of this mentioned text.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Abū al-Faraj al-Işfahānī (d. 356)</h2>



<p>The author of <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em> is Abū al-Faraj `Alī ibn al-Ĥusayn ibn Muĥammad ibn Aĥmad ibn al-Haytham al-Işfahānī, who was a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> <em>Zaydī </em>littérateur and traditionalist. This is a known fact which has been acknowledged by both <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> scholars.</p>



<p>The chief <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460) states in <em>al-Fihrist</em>:</p>



<p>أبو الفرج الأصبهاني زيدي المذهب له كتاب الأغاني الكبير وكتاب مقاتل الطالبيين وغير ذلك من الكتب وكتاب ما نزل من القرآن في أمير المؤمنين وأهل بيته عليهم السلام وكتاب فيه كلام فاطمة عليها السلام في فدك وغير ذلك من الكتب</p>



<p><strong>“Abū al-Faraj al-Aşbahānī: An adherent of the <em>Zaydī</em> school of thought. He authored the major <em>al-A<u>gh</u>ānī</em> [“The Songs”], <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em> [“Martyrdoms of the Descendents of Abū Ţālib”] and other such works; <em>Kitāb Mā Nazal min al-Qur’ān fī Amīr al-Mu’minīn wa Ahl Baytih `alayhim al-salām</em> [“A Book on What was Revealed in the Qur’ān About the Commander of the Believers and his <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> (as)”], a book which contains the speech of Fāţima (as) about Fadak, and other such works.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>The reviver of his century according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>, Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī (d. 726), has said in his <em>Rijāl</em>:</p>



<p>أبو الفرج الأصفهاني زيدي المذهب</p>



<p><strong>“Abū al-Faraj al-Işfahānī: An adherent of the <em>Zaydī</em> school of thought.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>Similarly, the venerated grandfather of al-Bahā’ī, Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Juba`ī (d. 886), wrote the following about Abū al-Faraj:</p>



<p>هو علي بن الحسين بن محمد بن أحمد بن الهيثم بن عبد الرحمن ابن مروان بن عبد الله بن مروان بن محمد بن مروان بن الحكم العاص الأموي الزيدي المذهب الأديب البارع له مصنفات جمة كالأغاني الكبير والصغير ومقاتل الطالبيين وغيرها</p>



<p><strong>“He is `Alī ibn al-Ĥusayn ibn Muĥammad ibn Aĥmad ibn al-Hay<u>th</u>am ibn `Abd al-Raĥmān ibn Marwān ibn `Abd Allāh ibn Marwān ibn Muĥammad ibn Marwān ibn al-Ĥakam al-`Ās al-Umawī, the adherent of the <em>Zaydī</em> school and versatile littérateur. He composed numerous works, such as the major and minor <em>al-A<u>gh</u>ānī</em>, <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em> and others.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>The famous <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389) explicitly mentions him as:</p>



<p>علي بن الحسين بن محمد بن أحمد بن الهيثم بن عبد الرحمن بن مروان الأموي الزيدي</p>



<p><strong>“`Alī ibn al-Ĥusayn ibn Muĥammad ibn Aĥmad ibn al-Hay<u>th</u>am ibn Marwān al-Umawī, the <em>Zaydī</em>.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-<u>Dh</u>arī`a ilá Taşānīf al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389), volume 21, page 376 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>He further mentions about the <em>Sunnī</em> scholars Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748) and `Afīf al-Dīn al-Yāfi`ī (d. 768):</p>



<p>والذهبي في ميزان الاعتدال واليافعي في مرآت الجنان أظهرا التعجب من كونه مروانيا شيعيا</p>



<p><strong>“Both al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī in <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em> and al-Yāfi`ī in <em>Mir’āt al-Jinān</em> displayed amazement at his being a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> descendant of Marwān.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-<u>Dh</u>arī`a ilá Taşānīf al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389), volume 21, page 376 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps the most remarkable mention of the views held by both <em>Sunnī</em> and <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars about Abū al-Faraj is provided by the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> editor of <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em>, Kāžim al-Mužaffar al-Najafī. He states in his introduction of the book:</p>



<p><strong>“Abū al-Faraj was a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> in respect of inclination and belief; upon the known <em>Zaydī</em> school of thought</strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Most of his biographers have specified his <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ism</em>, including his contemporary al-Qāđī al-Tannū<u>kh</u>ī, who has mentioned in his book <em>Ni<u>sh</u>wār al-Muĥāđara</em> that the former was among the adherents of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ism</em> who he had witnessed. Ibn <u>Sh</u>ākir said in <em>`Uyūn al-Tawārī<u>kh</u></em> that he was a predominant adherent of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ism</em>. Similarly, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī in <em>Amal al-Āmil</em> and al-<u>Kh</u>awānsārī in <em>Rawđāt al-Jannāt</em> have also specified his <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ism</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>As for Ibn al-A<u>th</u>īr, he has said in his book <em>al-Kāmil</em> that [Abū al-Faraj] was a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em>, but he found wonderment in the latter’s <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īsm</em> and thus added: ‘This is astonishing!’ Perhaps the point of astonishment according to Ibn al-A<u>th</u>īr is Abū al-Faraj’s being from the center of the Ummayad family—and how can then he be upon the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> school?—while all history knows is colors of enmity and then the political and religious contention that wrangled a long yoke between the Umayyads and Alids.</strong></p>



<p><strong>However, in reality, opinion—meaning, any opinion—knows no land&nbsp;or nationality, just as belief has no interference in the lineage of man regardless of whatever that lineage is.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn {Introduction}</em>, of Abū al-Faraj al-Aşfahānī (d. 356), page 14 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>So this Abū al-Faraj, who is claimed to be a <em>Sunnī</em> scholar and author of “Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah&#8217;s esteemed work &#8216;Maqatil al Talibeen&#8217;” by Answering-Ansar, is actually a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> from the <em>Zaydī</em> school of thought.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em></h2>



<p>As far as his <em>Maqātil</em> is concerned, then its condition can also be known from the words of&nbsp;Kāžim al-Mužaffar, who went through its entire content and edited it.</p>



<p>He states:</p>



<p>وظاهرة التشيع عند أبي الفرج واضحة الدلالة كل الوضوح في كتابه مقاتل الطالبيين</p>



<p><strong>“The phenomenon of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īsm</em> upon Abū al-Faraj is completely obvious in terms of indication in his book <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em>.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn {Introduction}</em>, of Abū al-Faraj al-Aşfahānī (d. 356), page 15 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>Āqā Buzurg also writes about <em>Maqātil</em>:</p>



<p>ويظهر من مواضع منه أنه شيعي زيدي المذهب</p>



<p><strong>“It appears from several instances in it that he was a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and adherent of the <em>Zaydī</em> school.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Dharī`a ilá Taşānīf al-Shī`a</em>, of Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389), volume 21, page 376 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is the truth about <em>Maqātil al-Ţālibiyyīn</em> and its <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī Zaydī</em> author Abū al-Faraj al-Işfahānī.</p>



<p>Yet again, this is another lesson to the readers. The next time they read a reference or quote from another one of “Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah&#8217;s esteemed” texts on Answering-Ansar, there is a good chance that it is actually a work written by a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em>.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt)&nbsp;who gives success, and blessings and peace be on the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[sa] (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>



<p>Earlier in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the expositions</a> of Answering-Ansar’s lies, it was shown how even a narration found in one of the most prominent Islamic texts, <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, became a target of their deceptive methodology of argumentation because it proves the marriage of `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb with Umm Kulthūm bint `Alī (ra). Of course, those who are familiar with Answering-Ansar and the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> paranoia concerning this marriage know that their deception would not simply end at blatantly lying about the text of the narration.</p>



<p>That narration is:</p>



<p>قال ثعلبة بن أبي مالك إن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قسم مروطا بين نساء من نساء المدينة فبقي مرط جيد فقال له بعض من عنده يا أمير المؤمنين أعط هذا ابنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم التي عندك يريدون أم كلثوم بنت علي فقال عمر أم سليط أحق وأم سليط من نساء الأنصار ممن بايع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال عمر فإنها كانت تزفر لنا القرب يوم أحد</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik said: ‘`Umar (ra) divided up some garments among some of the women of Madīna. One excellent garment remained and one of those with him said: ‘Commander of the believers! Give this to the (grand) daughter of the Messenger of Allāh (saws) to whom you are married—meaning Umm Kul<u>th</u>ūm the daughter of `Alī. `Umar (ra) replied: ‘Umm Salīţ is more entitled. Umm Salīţ was one of the people of Anşār who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allāh (saws).’ `Umar (ra) added: ‘She carried waterskins for us on the day of Uĥud.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 3, page 222 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>After disapproving the text of this narration by lying and advancing a barrage of inane and poorly constructed linguistic arguments, the Answering-Ansar team moves on to criticize its chain of transmission.</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The people of knowledge can identify the deceptive nature of this argument as soon as they first read it. In fact, even a student of knowledge can. But for those who do not know, this analysis concerning the chain of transmission by the Answering-Ansar team is based on transparent dishonesty.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar has stated that the chain of transmission of this narration is unreliable because it is related by Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra). To support this claim, they have proposed the following points about Tha`laba (ra):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is not mentioned in any of the texts pertaining to <em>r</em><em>ijāl</em> [narrators of <em>ĥadī<u>th</u></em>].</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Dhahabī, who includes “all manner” of narrators in his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, has not mentioned him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He is a completely unknown person.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, let us examine these claims and observe how much truth there is to them:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One – Tha`laba (ra) in the Texts of <em>Rijāl</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik’s “name is extant from the texts of rijjal.” This, unfortunately, is a barefaced lie because Tha`laba (ra) is mentioned in both <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts of narrator-biographies [<em>rijāl</em>].</p>

<p>And in case there remains any doubt, let us also quote some of the abovementioned works so the readers know what the texts of <em>rijāl</em> say about him under his biographical&nbsp;entry&nbsp;[<em>tarjama</em>].</p>



<p>The author of the <em>Şaĥīĥ</em>, Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī himself, writes in <em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي المديني كان كبيرا امام بني قريظة سمع عمر وحارثة بن النعمان وعن ابن عمر سمع منه ابن الهاد والزهري وابنه مالك</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī al-Madīnī: He was great; <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža. He heard narrations from `Umar, Ĥāri<u>th</u>a ibn al-Nu`mān and Ibn `Umar, and Ibn al-Hād, al-Zuhrī and his son Mālik heard narrations from him.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Kabīr</em>, of Abū `Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī (d. 256), volume 2, page 174 [Diyarbakir]</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the head <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī, writes in his <em>Rijāl</em> while listing the Companions (ra) who narrated from the Prophet (saws):</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk, the Quražī.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Rijāl al-Ţūsī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460), page 31 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī, who was a renowned <em>Sunnī</em> scholar and master of narrations, also mentions in <em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي المديني إمام مسجد بني قريظة أخرج البخاري في الجهاد وغير موضع عن الزهري عنه عن عمر بن الخطاب وقيس بن سعد قال الكلاباذي له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá, al-Quražī al-Madīnī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī has documented (his) narrations in the (book of) <em>Jihād</em>, and another place, from al-Zuhrī, and from `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>aţţāb and Qays ibn Sa`d. al-Kalābā<u>dh</u>ī said: ‘His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Ta`dīl wa al-Tajrīĥ li man <u>Kh</u>arraj `anh al-Bukhārī fī al-Jāmi` al-Şaĥīĥ</em>, of Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī (d. 474), volume 1, page 447 [Marrakech]</li>
</ul>



<p>In his voluminous and illustrious work on narrators, the <em>Sunnī</em> pinnacle Abū al-Ĥajjāj al-Mizzī states:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي حليف الأنصار أبو مالك ويقال أبو يحيى المدني إمام مسجد بني قريظة له رؤية من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá—al-Madanī: <em>Imām</em> of the mosque of the Qurayža tribe. His vision of the Prophet (saws) is proven.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Whereas the major <em>Sunnī</em> scholar of narrations and expert in the field of its narrators, Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī, also writes in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك القرظي له رؤية وسمع عمر وعنه ابناه منظور وأبو مالك والزهري</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: His vision (of the Prophet) is proven. He heard narrations from `Umar. His two sons Manžūr and Abū Mālik, and al-Zuhrī heard narrations from him.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if fī Ma`rifat man lahu Riwāya min al-Kutub al-Sitta</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 284 [Jeddah]</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Mīrzā Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī, a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and expert in the field of narrators, writes in <em>Manhaj al-Maqāl</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Manhaj al-Maqāl fī Taĥqīq Aĥwāl al-Rijāl</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Astarābādī (d. 1028), volume 3, page 130 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author of one of the main texts of <em>rijāl</em> among the <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>ariyya</em>, al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī writes in the same work:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرطي من أصحاب الرسول صلى الله عليه وآله</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: He is from the Companions of the Messenger (saws).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muşţafá al-Tafrishī (d. 1044), volume 1, page 317 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> al-Astarābādī’s and al-Tafrishī’s printed works have&nbsp;a diacritical point missing from “al-Quražī” but the correct word is with a point as elucidated by <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> editors.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī also writes:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مليك القرظي ل</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: A Companion of the Prophet.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Jāmi` al-Ruwāt fī Izāĥat al-Ishtibāhāt `an al-Ţuruq wa al-Isnād</em>, of Muĥammad ibn `Alī al-Ardabīlī (d. 1101), volume 1, page 140 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in short, the famous and major texts of <em>rijāl</em> separately&nbsp;mention&nbsp;Tha`laba (ra) with words that prove nothing but his praiseworthiness. But the Answering-Ansar team confidently “refutes” the chain of transmission by deceptively misleading their readers into thinking that the texts of <em>rijāl</em> do not even mention the <em>name</em> of Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two – al-Dhahabī and his <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em></h2>



<p>Answering-Ansar states about Tha`laba:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is what one calls mixing the truth with falsehood. al-Dhahabī has mentioned the biography of Tha`laba (ra) in <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em>, <em>Tārī<u>kh</u> al-Islām</em> and <em>al-Tajrīd</em>. A quote from <em>al-Kā<u>sh</u>if</em> has already been cited and the following is what al-Dhahabī states about him in his dictionary of the Companions of the Prophet (saws), <em>al-Tajrīd</em>:</p>



<p>ثعلبة بن أبي مالك أبو يحيى القرظي إمام بني قريظة ولد في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وله رؤية وطال عمره روى عنه إبنه أبو مالك وصفوان بن سليم له حديثان مرسلان</p>



<p><strong>“<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik, Abū Yaĥyá,</strong><strong> al-Quražī</strong><strong>: <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe. He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and his vision (of him) is proven. He lived a long age. His son Abū Mālik and Şafwān ibn Sulaym narrated from him. He has two dispatched narrations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tajrid_sahaba_1_69.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Tajrīd Asmā’ al-Şaĥāba</em>, of <u>Sh</u>ams al-Dīn al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 69 [Beirut]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What the Answering-Ansar team did is that they deceivingly left all these works behind and jumped to <em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl</em>, while covering the act by lying that the author has mentioned the biographies of “all manner” of narrators in it. The truth, however, is different. It is a known fact that al-Dhahabī has not included all types of narrators in his <em>Mīzān</em>. In fact, <em>Mīzān</em> is a work on narrators whose reliability has been questioned and therefore he has not included many narrators in it, including the Companions of the Prophet (saws).</p>



<p>He explicitly states about the Companions (ra) in the introduction of the work:</p>



<p>ولا أذكرهم في هذا المصنف فإن الضعف إنما جاء من جهة الرواة إليهم وكذا لا أذكر في كتابي من الآئمة المتبوعين في الفروع أحدا لجلالتهم في الاسلام وعظمتهم في النفوس</p>



<p><strong>“I will <u>not mention</u> them in this compilation, for the weakness has come from the sub-narrators that are linked to them. Similarly, I will not mention any of the followed <em>Imāms</em> in this book, such as Abū Ĥanīfa, al-<u>Sh</u>āfi`ī and al-Bu<u>kh</u>arī due their majesty in Islam and essential greatness.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<li><em>Mīzān al-I`tidāl fī Naqd al-Rijāl</em>, of Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī (d. 748), volume 1, page 3 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The highly praised <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar al-Mīrzā Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339) also confirms this while criticizing both <em>Sunnīs</em> and al-Dhahabī:</p>



<p>هذا الذهبي على إمامته وجلالته عندهم تأنف من ذكر الصحابة في كتابه</p>



<p><strong>“This al-<u>Dh</u>ahabī, despite of his scholarly leadership and loftiness according to them, utterly detested the mention of the Companions in his book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Qawl al-Şurāĥ fī al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī wa Şaĥīĥih al-Jāmi`</em>, of Fatĥ Allāh al-Işfahānī (d. 1339), page 42 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus, the reason why al-Dhahabī has not included Tha`laba (ra) in his <em>Mīzān</em> is because he is a Companion, as mentioned by him in <em>al-Tajrīd</em>, not because he is unknown, and Answering-Ansar’s claim that al-Dhahabī has included the “biographies of all manner” of narrators in it is yet another example of their dishonesty and misrepresentation of <em>Sunnī</em> texts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three – “Completely Unknown”?</h2>



<p>It has been shown above that the biography of Tha`laba (ra) has been mentioned in over a dozen <em>Sunnī</em> and <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts of narrator-biographies. If someone actually goes through other texts such as compilations of narrations, commentaries and genealogical works,&nbsp;there is no doubt that a lot more can be read about Tha`laba (ra).</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) writes in <em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>Th</u></strong><strong>a`laba ibn Abī Malīk:</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> [al-Ţūsī] has mentioned him among the Companions of the Messenger (saws). This is how the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> has named his father, ‘Abī Malīk.’ However, it is ‘ibn Abī Mālik’ in <em>al-Ţabaqāt</em>, <em>al-Istī`āb</em>, <em>Usd al-<u>Gh</u>āba</em>, <em>al-Işāba</em> and <em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Muĥammad ibn Sa`d said in <em>al-Ţabaqāt al-Kabīr</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh ibn Sām, and <u>Th</u>a`laba is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ Abī Mālik came from Yemen and said: ‘We are from the tribe of Kindah which is on the Jewish religion.’ He then married into the Ibn Sa`ya (family) of the Qurayža tribe and confederated with them; thus it was said: ‘the Quražī.’ He has narrated from `Umar and `U<u>th</u>mān. He used be given the cognomen of ‘Abū Ja`far.’ <u>Th</u>a`laba was <em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža until he passed away. He was great and did not narrate many narrations.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in <em>al-Istī`āb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī: He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws). The name of ‘Abī Mālik’ is `Abd Allāh, and he—meaning, <u>Th</u>a`laba—is given the cognomen of ‘Abū Yaĥyá’ from Kindah. His father came from Yemen, on the Jewish religion. He was accommodated by the Qurayža tribe and thus he is ascribed to them. He was not one of them, so he accepted Islam. He narrated from `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān and all the Companions.’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is in </strong><strong><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em>:</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘<u>Th</u>a`laba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, the confederate of the Anşār, Abū Mālik—and it is said ‘Abū Yaĥyá.’ His vision (of the Prophet) is proven</strong><strong>. He narrated from the Prophet (saws), `Umar, `U<u>th</u>mān, Jābir, Ĥāritha ibn al-Nu`mān and a large group. His two sons Abū Mālik and Manžūr, al-Zuhrī, al-Miswar ibn Rifā`a, Muĥammad ibn `Uqba ibn Abī Mālik al-Quražī, Şafwān ibn Sulaym and others narrated from him. al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī said: ‘He was great,&nbsp;<em>Imām</em> of the tribe of Qurayža and&nbsp;on the Jewish religion. He married a woman from the tribe of Qurayža and thus he was ascribed to them, while he was (originally) from Kindah. Tha`laba used to lead the tribe of Qurayža in his youth. Abū Ĥātim said: ‘He is from the predecessors.’ al-`Ijlī said: ‘A trustworthy predecessor.’ And Ibn Ĥibbān mentioned him in <em>al-<u>Th</u>iqāt</em> [“The Trustworthy Narrators”].’</strong><strong>’</strong></p>



<p><strong>It is not known whether he falls under the condition of our book.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>A`yān al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn (d. 1371), volume 4, page 22 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up all of the aforementioned information about Tha`laba (ra) present in <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, it is known that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His ancestors were from Yemen.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was born during the time of the Prophet (saws) and lived a long life.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a Companion of the Prophet (saws).</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His cognomen was Abū Mālik—others also said Abū Yaĥyá.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was a confederate of the Anşār.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He narrated from `Umar ibn al-Khaţţāb, `Uthmān ibn `Affān (ra), and others.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His sons, al-Zuhrī, and others narrated from him.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He was the <em>Imām</em> of the Qurayža tribe until his demise.</li>
</ul>



<p>In spite of this information that is spread throughout innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, the Answering-Ansar team says that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is “a completely unknown personality.”</p>



<p>Can this be called anything but outright lying?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>It has been evidently shown that Tha`laba ibn Abī Mālik (ra) is not an unknown or unreliable narrator, rather a Companion of the Prophet (saws) whose biography is present in innumerous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> and <em>Sunnī</em> texts, and particularly the texts of <em>rijāl</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to explicitly say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Bukhari has narrated this tradition on the authority of Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik who is a completely unknown personality, so there is no way to ascertain the reliability of the narrator. His name is extant from the texts of rijjal, Dhahabi who in his Meezan al Itidal had narrated the biographies of all manner of narrator makes no reference to Tha&#8217;laba bin Abi Malik. A tradition by an unknown narrator automatically means we can discard it. Even if we accept it, the wife relation can still not be proven since Undh means close &#8211; narrators have translated it as wife in hope that they can continue to live the lie perpetuated by the Ahl&#8217;ul Sunnah, that Umar married Umme Kalthum daughter of Imam &#8216;Ali (as).<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/aa_kulthum_40.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Nikah of Lady Umme Kulthum[as]</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/umme_kulthum/en/chap4.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 40</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Once again, it has been shown how Answering-Ansar chooses deceptive methods of argumentation by blatantly lying about narrators and Islamic texts for the sole reason of denying a narration that goes against their view.</p>



<p><strong>Is this what the Answering-Ansar team means by their motto, “Revealing the Truth”?</strong></p>



<p>We will let the readers decide.</p>



<p>As for the “Undh” absurdity, that has been covered in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011738/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/content/5-blatant-lie-about-%C5%9Fa%C4%A5%C4%AB%C4%A5-al-bukh%C4%81r%C4%AB-i-umm-kulth%C5%ABm-%E2%80%9Cbint-al%C4%AB%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">one of the earlier expositions</a>.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Our 20 questions&#8230; (Revision: 1.0.1)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em> are known to misinterpret, misquote and distort texts in order to defame Mu`āwiya (ra), the Companion of the Prophet (saws). Answering-Ansar has also marked its effort in this regard by brazenly&nbsp;lying about&nbsp;<em>Tārī<u>kh</u>-i Islām</em> of Akbar Shāh al-Najībābādī (d. 1357).</p>



<p>They write:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>17.</strong> If failing to believe in Hadhrath Ayesha is an act of Kufr what opinion should we hold with regards to her killer?<br><em><u>Hadhrath Ayesha was killed by Mu&#8217;awiya</u> (Tarikh al Islam, by Najeeb Abadi, Vol 2 p 44)</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216090954/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/20_questions_5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121216090954/http://www.answering-ansar.org/challenges/20questions/en/index.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"><em>Our 20 questions&#8230;</em>, page 5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The claim and the text referenced are obvious to the readers.</p>



<p>By posing this question, the Answering-Ansar team is suggesting that the Companion Mu`āwiya (ra) should be condemned because he murdered the Mother of the Believers, `Ā’isha bint Abī Bakr (ra), and this is proven from al-Najībābādī’s <em>Tārī<u>kh</u>-i Islām</em>. It is also worthy to note that the exact page and volume is mentioned as well, implying that the reference is verified.</p>



<p>Now, let us see what al-Najībābādī has really written:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Real Words of al-Najībābādī</h2>



<p>What al-Najībābādī has actually written about the death of `Ā’isha (ra) is:</p>



<p>سنہ ٥٨ھ میں حضرت ام المومنین حضرت عائشہ صدیقہ رضی ﷲ عنہا فوت ہو کر البقیع میں مدفون ہوئیں آپ مروان کی مخالفت کیا کرتی تہیں کیونکہ اس کے اعمال اچھے نہ تھے مروان نے ایک روز دھوکے سے دعوت کے بہانے سے بلا کر ایک گڑھے میں جس میں ننگی تلواریں اور خنجر وغیرہ رکھ دیۓ تھے آپ کو گرا دیا تھا آپ بہت ضعیف اور بوڑہی تھیں زخمی ہوئیں اور انہیں زخموں کے صدمہ سے فوت ہو گئیں</p>



<p><strong>“In 58 A.H., the respected Mother of the Believers `Ā’i<u>sh</u>a Şiddīqa (ra) passed away, and was buried in al-Baqī`. She used to oppose <u>Marwān</u> because his actions were not good. One day, <u>Marwān</u> deceitfully invited her for dinner as&nbsp;a pretense&nbsp;and threw her in a cavity, in which he had placed bare swords and daggers. She was very elderly and weak, became wounded and passed away due to the concussion caused by the wounds.”</strong></p>

<p><em>Subĥān Allāh</em>.</p>



<p>The quote above is crystal-clear.</p>



<p>There is absolutely <strong>no</strong> mention of Mu`āwiya (ra) in what al-Najībābādī&nbsp;relates about the demise of `Ā’isha (ra). Instead, he&nbsp;relates—without any proof—that it was Marwān ibn al-Ĥakam,&nbsp;someone not&nbsp;even regarded as&nbsp;a Companion of the Prophet (saws)&nbsp;by the&nbsp;<em>Sunnīs</em>, who allegedly murdered her.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar’s lie is evident and requires no explanation.</p>



<p>May Allāh (swt) protect all unbiased Muslims from such deception.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<p>Answering-Ansar Article:</p>



<p>Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef? (Revision: 1.0.0)</p>



<p>Whenever someone raises a question about a narration promoting the belief in distortion of the Holy Qur’ān found in major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts, their apologists immediately embrace deceptive methods&nbsp;to free themselves from all burden. One of these methods is to say that neither did any of their scholars ever compile a work of narrations that he himself considered entirely authentic nor did any of them ever claim such a thing about any of the texts.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team forwards these very same notions in the following words:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih. Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih. Likewise Sheikh Muhammad Jawwad Ma`tiya states the hadith books of our school like Al Kafi, Istibsar, Al Tahdib, Man La Yuhizar al Faiqh contain both Sahih and weak hadiths. Similarly, the books on Fiqha written by our scholars contain material that have mistakes. It would therefore be correct to assert that according to the Shia of Ali [as] there is no book besides that Holy Quran which is flawless from its beginning till its end. One cannot therefore cite the tradition from the Shia hadith book against the Shia of Ali [as] as when the Shia reject the authenticity of such a hadith. In order to corroborate our stance, it would suffice to say that Shiekh Muhammad Yaqub Kuleini (d 329 H) recorded 16200 hadiths in his book ‘Al Kafi’. The scholars have categorized these hadiths in respect of Rijal under five different categories i.e Sahih, Mawthiq, Qawi, Hasan, Daeef [weak]. It is therefore evident that since scholars applied this division to our principle book Al Kafi, that is deemed as reliable and a source of Islamic instructions, the authority and authenticity of other books is self clarified.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4-5.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4-5</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Many unwary Muslims are deceived by these two expressions due to their lack of knowledge about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> literature and scholars, but those who have spent years as <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> or studying them know very well that these are nothing but patent lies.</p>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has proposed two notions here:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>No <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> author ever claimed that all the narrations compiled in his book “were correct and Sahih.”</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>None among the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars of narrations and jurisprudence testified that any specific <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> text containing narrations “were all acceptable and Sahih.”</li>
</ul>



<p>The following revealing set of facts will show the readers that both these claims are actually lies forwarded by the Answering-Ansar team to deceive Muslims.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction of the Four Books</h2>



<p>Before moving on with the facts, readers should know that the most authoritative compilations after the Qur’ān, according to <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī <u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em>, are what they call <em>al-Kutub al-Arba`a</em> [“The Four Books”]. These four compilations are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em> <em>fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329)</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> of Ibn Bābawayh al-Şadūq al-Qummī (d. 381)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tah<u>dh</u>īb al-Aĥkām fī <u>Sh</u>arĥ al-Muqni`a</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Istibşār fī mā I<u>kh</u>talaf min al-A<u>kh</u>bār</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī (d. 460)</li>
</ul>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ĥusayn Baĥr al-`Ulūm (d. 1422) writes about these four books in his introduction to <em>Tal<u>kh</u>īs al-<u>Sh</u>āfī</em> of Abū Ja`far al-Ţūsī:</p>



<p>إن الإجتهاد لدى الشيعة مرتكز على الكتب الأربعة الكافي للكليني ومن لا يحضره الفقيه للصدوق والتهذيب والاستبصار للطوسي وهي من الأصول المسلمة كالصحاح الستة لدى العامة</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, scholarly endeavour, according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, is dependant on the Four Books: <em>al-Kāfī</em> of al-Kulaynī, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> al-Şadūq, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb </em>and <em>al-Istibşār</em> of al-Ţūsī. These are from the accepted principle books that are as the Six <em>Şiĥāĥ</em> are according to the Commoners.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Tal<u>kh</u>īs al-<u>Sh</u>āfī {Introduction}</em>, of al-Sayyid Ĥusayn Baĥr al-`Ulūm (d. 1422), page 29 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>Let us now proceed:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kulaynī (d. 329) and <em>al-Kāfī</em></h2>



<p><em>al-Kāfī fī `Ilm al-Ĥadīth</em> of the major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī is the most authoritative and renowned compilation of the Four Books. The author of this work, al-Kulaynī, believed that all the narrations in his work are authentic and correct, and that is the reason why he actually compiled it.</p>



<p>In the introduction of <em>al-Kāfī</em>, he explicitly said:</p>



<p>وقلت إنك تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب كاف يجمع فيه من جميع فنون علم الدين ما يكتفي به المتعلم ويرجع إليه المسترشد ويأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام والسنن القائمة التي عليها العمل وبها يؤدي فرض الله عز وجل وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وقلت لو كان ذلك رجوت أن يكون ذلك سببا يتدارك الله تعالى بمعونته وتوفيقه إخواننا وأهل ملتنا ويقبل بهم إلى مراشدهم</p>



<p><strong>“Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book which is sufficient, brings together the entire Islamic sciences of the knowledge of religion within it, wholly satisfies the needs of the student, acts as a reference for the seekers of guidance, and would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving <u>correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)</u> and the upright and acted upon traditions from it—through which the compulsory duties of Allāh, the Powerful and Exalted, and the tradition of His Prophet (saws) can be fulfilled.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And you said: ‘If that happens, I can hope that (the book) would be a means through which Allāh will rectify our brothers and people of our religious community through his support and grace, and take them closer to their salvation.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 8 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Following this, he said:</p>



<p>وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Kāfī</em>, of Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī (d. 329), volume 1, page 9 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an explicit confirmation from al-Kulaynī that the reason he compiled <em>al-Kāfī</em> was so he can provide <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> with a book of authentic narrations that is sufficient for them—i.e. his book only contained correct reports according to him.</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Mahdī al-Āşifī writes about al-Kulaynī while discussing <em>al-Kāfī</em> in his epistle <em>Tarī<u>kh</u> Fiqh Ahl al-Bayt</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جمع رحمه الله في موسوعته هذه ما صح لديه من أحاديث الأئمة الهداة عليهم السلام</p>



<p><strong>“He—may Allāh have mercy on him—has collected what he found authentic from the narrations of the guiding <em>Imāms</em> (as) in this encyclopedia of his.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Riyāđ al-Masā’il fī Bayān Aĥkām al-Shar` wa al-Dalā’il</em>, of al-Sayyid `Alī al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1231), volume 1, page 31 [Qum] – <em>Tarīkh Fiqh Ahl al-Bayt</em> included in the introduction.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū Ţālib al-Tajlīl al-Tabrīzī, author of the famous booklet translated as <em>‘</em><em>Spurious Arguments about the Shia</em>,<em>’</em> confirms this declaration of al-Kulaynī in the introduction to his book known as <em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāwī</em>.</p>



<p>He writes about al-Kulaynī and his <em>al-Kāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد صرح في مقدمته بصحة أحاديثه حيث قال وقلت تحب أن يكون عندك كتاب يأخذ منه من يريد علم الدين والعمل به بالآثار الصحيحة عن الصادقين عليهم السلام . . . . إلى أن قال وقد يسر الله وله الحمد تأليف ما سألت وأرجو أن يكون بحيث توخيت</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction, when he said: ‘</strong><strong>Verily, you solemnly wished that you possess a book would be used by those who want to attain the knowledge of religion and practice upon it by deriving correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of the truthful ones (as)…’ to: ‘Allāh, all praise to him, has facilitated the compilation of what you requested. I hope that (this book) will be in accordance with the wishes you had in mind.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>This declaration of al-Kulaynī was so influential in history that it even led a group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars to use it as an argument for <em>their</em> belief in the immaculacy of the contents of <em>al-Kāfī</em>. Among them is al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), a major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of that group and an expert in the field of narrations, who staunchly believed in the correctness of all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>He states about the declaration of al-Kulaynī cited above:</p>



<p>وهو صريح أيضا في الشهادة بصحة أحاديث كتابه لوجوه منها قوله بالآثار الصحيحة ومعلوم أنه لم يذكر فيه قاعدة يميز بها الصحيح عن غيره لو كان فيه غير صحيح ولا كان اصطلاح المتأخرين موجودا في زمانه قطعا كما يأتي فعلم أن كل ما فيه صحيح باصطلاح القدماء بمعنى الثابت عن المعصوم بالقرائن القطعية أو التواتر</p>



<p><strong>“This is also an explicit declaration of authenticity of the narrations in his book due to various points.</strong></p>



<p><strong>One of these points is: His statement: ‘Authentic narrations.’ It is well-known that neither did he mention a rule that distinguishes the rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narration from the other categories in (the book), even if there is a non-<em>şaĥīĥ</em> narration in it, nor were the terminologies of the later scholars absolutely present during his time, as it will </strong><strong>be further explained.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Thus, it is known that all the narrations in it are correct [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] by the terminology of the early scholars, with the meaning of being proven from the infallible on the basis of categorical indications or consecutiveness.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><u>Kh</u></em><em>ātimat Tafşīl Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a ilá Taĥşīl Masā’il al-<u>Sh</u>arī`a</em>, of al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī (d. 1104), volume 30, page 196 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> What al-Ĥurr means by “the terminology of later scholars” are the terminologies introduced with the categorization of narrations, in terms of their authenticity, that was not invented until the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> Islamic century. Before this categorization, the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars viewed the narrations to be either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. This will be further elaborated in this writing.</p>



<p>Opposing the view of this group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Mujāhid al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242) replied to this argument in the following words:</p>



<p>إن إخبار الكليني بصحة ما دونه في الكافي كما يمكن أن يكون باعتبار علمه بها وقطعه بصدورها عن الأئمة عليهم السلام فيجوز الاعتماد عليها والحال هذه كسائر أخبار العدول كذلك يمكن أن يكون باعتبار اجتهاده وظهورها عنده ولو بالدليل الظني فلا يجوز إذن الاعتماد عليه فإن ظن المجتهد لا يكون حجة على مثله كما هو الظاهر من الأصحاب بل ومن العقلاء وحيث لا ترجيح للاحتمال الأول وجب التوقف به لأن الشك في الشرط يوجب الشك في المشروط فيلزم التوقف</p>



<p><strong>“Indeed</strong><strong>, the testimony of al-Kulaynī concerning the authenticity of (the narrations) he has recorded in <em>al-Kāfī</em>, just as it is possible that it is in consideration of his knowledge and certainty of their issuance from the <em>Imāms</em> (as), in which case it is permissible to depend upon them and its status will be the same as of all the reports of just individuals, it is (also) possible that it is in consideration of his independent judgment [<em>ijtihād</em>] and their appearance to him on the basis of conjectural proof. In this case it is impermissible to depend upon them, for the conjecture of a scholar capable of independent judgment [<em>mujtahid</em>] is not proof for those of the same stature, as it is obvious from other scholars, in fact, even from those with intellect.</strong></p>



<p><strong>And when there is no preference for the first possibility, it is incumbent to desist from holding on it because doubt about the condition necessitates doubt about what the condition is applied upon. Therefore, desistance is incumbent.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mafātīĥ al-Uşūl</em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥammad al-Ţabāţabā’ī (d. 1242), page 332 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī leaves out al-Ţabāţabā’ī’s analogical justifications and puts it in simple words:</p>



<p>واعتقاد الكليني بصحة الرواية ليس من الحجج الشرعية إذ ليس هو معصوما عندنا</p>



<p><strong>“The belief of al-Kulaynī about the correctness of traditions is not a legal proof because he is not an infallible according to us!”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Dirāsāt fī al-Makāsib al-Muĥarrama</em>, of Ĥusayn `Alī al-Muntažarī, volume 3, page 123 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>So in a nutshell, between the occurrence of inter-<em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> disputes on whether <em>al-Kāfī</em> is entirely correct or not, the fact remains that al-Kulaynī himself declared, and thus believed in, the authenticity of the narrations found in his book.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ibn Bābawayh (d.381) and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em></h2>



<p>Abū Ja`far ibn Bābawayh al-Qummī, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar known as al-Shaykh al-Şadūq, also believed that all the narrations he has recorded in his compilation <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> are all authentic and correct. In fact, just as al-Kulaynī, he has himself declared their authenticity while mentioning the reason why he compiled the work.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh explicitly mentions in the introduction to <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> that he has compiled this work on narrations because another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of his era, Sharaf al-Dīn Ni`ma, requested him to author a condensed work dealing with jurisprudence, Islamic laws and the permitted and prohibited.</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<p>وصنفت له هذا الكتاب بحذف الأسانيد لئلا تكثر طرقه وإن كثرت فوائده ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>I have compiled this book for him without chains of transmission, so that its transmissions should not be too many while its benefits are abundant. I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, exalted is His power.”</strong></p>

<p>These words of Ibn Bābawayh are extremely obvious and show that he believed that all the narrations in his book are authentic and correct.</p>



<p>Contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and intellectual, Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, writes after quoting these words of Ibn Bābawayh:</p>



<p>ونصه هذا واضح وصريح في أنه يعتقد بصحة ما في كتابه ويراه حجة بينه وبين الله تعالى</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>This explicit statement of his is clear and unequivocal in showing that he believes in the authenticity of what is in his book, and views it to be proof between himself and Allāh the Exalted.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, page 217 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This is further confirmed by al-Tabrīzī, who states about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>وقد صرح لصحة أحاديثه بقوله في مقدمته قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه أنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي</p>



<p><strong>“He has declared the authenticity of its narrations in his introduction,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>with his statement: ‘I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is a proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Mu`jam al-Maĥāsin wa al-Masāmī</em>, of Abū Ţālib al-Tabrīzī, page 17 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another thing worthy of mention here is what is mentioned in the transcribed lectures of the contemporary Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Alī al-Sīstānī about Ibn Bābawayh and his book:</p>



<p>إنه قدس سره قد شهد في مقدمة كتابه بصحة جميع ما رواه فيه حيث قال ولم أقصد فيه قصد المصنفين في إيراد جميع ما رووه بل قصدت إلى إيراد ما أفتي به وأحكم بصحته وأعتقد فيه إنه حجة فيما بيني وبين ربي تقدس ذكره وتعالت قدرته</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Verily, he—may Allāh sanctify his secret—has certified the authenticity of <em>all</em> that he has narrated in it, in the introduction, when he said: ‘I did not intend to present all of what they have narrated, as authors usually do; rather I intended to present that by which I give legal opinions and rule to be authentic [<em>aĥkum bi şiĥĥatih</em>], and believe that it is proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] between me and my Lord, sacred is His mention and exalted is His power.’”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Qā`ida lā Đarar wa lā Đirār</em>, of `Alī al-Sīstānī, page 87 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is obvious from Ibn Bābawayh’s own words, the reason why he removed the chains of transmission from <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em> is because he did not want to present any narration that was not authentic or proof [<em>ĥujja</em>] according to him, like other scholars usually did in their compilations. And since Ibn Bābawayh was one of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars and there were no terminologies of the later scholars during his time, it can easily be understood from his authentication that he viewed the narrations to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>However, in case the Answering-Ansar team customarily rejects all manners taught by the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> (ra) to impolitely accuse other “cults” of misinterpreting Ibn Bābawayh’s words, let us cite a few more statements of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who have acknowledged his view.</p>



<p>The major <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), who was admired as the “teacher of all” by even the top scholar-marionettes of the Safavids, states in his <em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى رئيس المحدثين ثقة الإسلام محمد بن بابويه قدس الله روحه على متعارف المتقدمة في إطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن إليه ويعتمد عليه فحكم بصحة جميع ما أورده من الأحاديث في كتاب من لا يحضره الفقيه</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The head of the scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>īn</em>], the trustworthy of Islam, Muĥammad ibn Bābawayh—may Allāh sanctify his soul—has taken the <u>traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em></u>.<em>’</em> Thus, he has ruled the correctness of all the narrations he has mentioned in the book <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma<u>sh</u>riq al-<u>Sh</u>amsayn wa Iksīr al-Sa`ādatayn</em>, of Bahā’ al-Dīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1034), page 269-270 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>Another <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of high stature and author of over a hundred texts, Muĥammad Muĥsin al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī (d. 1091), also writes something fairly close in his voluminous <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>وقد جرى صاحبا كتابي الكافي والفقيه على متعارف المتقدمين في اطلاق الصحيح على ما يركن اليه ويعتمد عليه فحكما بصحة جميع ما أورداه في كتابيهما من الأحاديث وإن لم يكن كثير منه صحيحا على مصطلح المتأخرين</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The authors of the two books, <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, have taken the traditional course of the early scholars in terming the relied and depended upon (narrations) as <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em>.<em>’</em> Thus, they have ruled the correctness of all the narrations they have mentioned in their books, even though many of them are not <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to the terminology of the later scholars.”</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>These quotes sufficiently demonstrate that like al-Kulaynī, Ibn Bābawayh too declared the authenticity of the narrations found in his book in the introduction, while being on the course of the early <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ţūsī (d. 460) and his <em>Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em></h2>



<p>This just leaves the last two of the Four Books. Our respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> brothers may find this hard to assimilate, but al-Ţūsī also confirmed the authenticity of these compilations of his.</p>



<p>al-Fayđ al-Kāshānī states in <em>al-Wāfī</em>:</p>



<p>أن مدار الأحكام الشرعية اليوم على هذه الأصول الأربعة وهي المشهود عليها بالصحة من مصنفها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>These four key books are the pivot of legal rulings today, and they are testified as correct by their compilers.”</strong></p>

<p>Similarly, the famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar Yūsuf al-Baĥrānī (d. 1186) also states while objecting about the opposing group of scholars from his own <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> school:</p>



<p>أن التوثيق والجرح الذي بنوا عليه تنويع الأخبار إنما أخذوه من كلام القدماء وكذلك الأخبار التي رويت في أحوال الرواة من المدح والذم إنما أخذوها عنهم فإذا اعتمدوا عليهم في مثل ذلك فكيف لا يعتمدون عليهم في تصحيح ما صححوه من الأخبار واعتمدوه وضمنوا صحته كما صرح به جملة منهم كما لا يخفى على من لاحظ ديباجتي الكافي والفقيه وكلام الشيخ في العدة وكتابي الأخبار</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The narrator commendation and condemnation, on which the categorization of reports was based, is obtained from the statements of the early scholars. Similarly, the reports that are related concerning the conditions of narrators in terms of praise and dispraise are (also) obtained from them.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If they have relied upon them [i.e. the early scholars] concerning a matter such as that, how is it that they do not rely upon them concerning the authenticity of the reports that they deemed correct, relied upon and ensured to be authentic as a score of them have (even) explicitly declared—something not hidden to he who has observed the introductions of <em>al-Kāfī</em> and <em>al-Faqīh</em>, <u>and the words of <em>al-Shaykh</em> [al-Ţūsī] in <em>al-`Udda</em> and the two books of reports [i.e. <em>Tahdhīb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>]</u>.”</strong></p>

<p>These strong words of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that were only uncovered due to the fiery disputes that occurred between them concerning the categorization of narrations in terms of their authenticity, make the stance of the author of the four most authoritative books of narrations very clear—i.e. they viewed the narrations in their works to be authentic and correct.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted here that no one is arguing that what was considered a <em>şaĥīĥ</em> or correct narration among these four scholars is equivalent to what is defined as “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>” according to the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars today, for it is a known fact that the categorization of narrations followed by the majority of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arīs</em> today was not introduced until long after these four individuals and thus, as quoted from al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and Bahā’ al-Dīn, they were on the traditional course of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars concerning the categorization of narrations—i.e. it is either <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>That being said, it has been evidently shown that these four scholars believed the narrations in their books to be correct or as they believed, “<em>şaĥīĥ</em>.” And what is being demonstrated here is their own view of the narrations in their books, not how <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars, who took the other course, understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> and <em>Uşūlī</em> Dispute</h2>



<p>Interestingly, this very same dispute about the categorization of narrations in itself shows that the Answering-Ansar team has not been truthful in relaying information about <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars.</p>



<p>Answering-Ansar says:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>Similarly none amongst the Shia Muhaditheen and jurists testified to any specific Shia book containing hadiths that were all acceptable and Sahih.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The abovementioned quotes are sufficient in showing that this statement is an obvious lie. Nonetheless, let us quote a few more <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars as an elaboration of this issue so this lie of Answering-Ansar becomes much more clear to the readers.</p>



<p>Dr. `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī writes under the heading <em>‘</em><em>The Authentication of the Narrations in the Four Books</em><em>’</em> in his <em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>:</p>



<p>يراد بالتصحيح هنا اعتداد جميع ما في الكتب الأربعة من أحاديث رويت عن أهل البيت عليهم السلام معتبرة ومقطوعا بصدورها عن الأئمة والمسألة هذه وقعت موقع الخلاف بين علمائنا وطال البحث فيها وطال معه النقاش حولها</p>



<p><strong>“What is meant by ‘authentication’ here is considering all the narrations that are related from the <em>Ahl al-Bayt</em> in the Four Books, to be reliable and certainly issued from the <em>Imāms</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>There has occurred a dispute between our scholars concerning this issue. Discussions lengthened concerning it, and so did the argumentations.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Uşūl al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of `Abd al-Hādī al-Fađlī, page 210 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>This dispute about authentication and categorization of narrations has occurred between two groups of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars. These two groups are known as:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <em>Uşūlīs</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The late introduction of categorizing narrations with four different terminologies in terms of their authenticity and inauthenticity, led the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars to continue following the course early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars adhered to before its invention.</p>



<p><em><u>Sh</u></em><em>ī`ī</em> scholar and researcher, al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Mūsawī al-Ghurayfī (d. 1412) explains this in his work approved by Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī, <em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadīth</em>:</p>



<p>وقد شجب الأخباريون تنويع الحديث وعدوه من البدع التي يحرم العمل بها وبسطوا البحث في إبطاله وإثبات صحة جميع أخبار كتبنا الأربعة بل جميع الأخبار التي نقلوها عن الكتب المعتبرة لأنها محفوفة بقرائن تفيد الوثوق بصدورها عن المعصوم عليه السلام</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have disapproved of the categorization of narrations, and counted it among innovations that are forbidden to be practiced! They elaborated the discussion in nullification of it and establishing the authenticity of all the reports in our Four Books, rather all the reports that were copied from authoritative books, for they are enclosed with evidences that assist the certainty of their issuance from the infallible (as).”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Qawā`id al-Ĥadī<u>th</u></em>, of al-Sayyid Muĥyī al-Dīn al-Ghurayfī, page 16-17 [Najaf]</li>
</ul>



<p>To sum up, the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> reject the categorization, considering it unorthodox, and believe that all the narrations in the Four Books are correct and authentic. And as they remain on the course of the early <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars who believed a narration can either be <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> or not <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, their view of the authenticity of narrations is that they are all <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Murtađá Muţahharī (d. 1407) states about the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārī</em> group of scholars:</p>



<p>أنهم يزعمون أن جميع الأخبار الواردة في الكتب الأربعة وهي الكافي ومن لا يحضره الفقيه والتهذيب والاستبصار أخبار صحيحة ومعتبرة بل وقطعية الصدور</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>They claim that all the reports in the Four Books—which are <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>, <em>al-Tah<u>dh</u>īb</em> and <em>al-Istibşār</em>—are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and reliable, in fact, certainly issued (from the infallibles).”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Similarly, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Muĥsin al-Amīn al-`Āmilī (d. 1371) also writes in his magnum opus, <em>A`yān al-Shī`a</em>:</p>



<p>فزعم الأخباريون أن اخبار الكتب الأربعة كلها صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> claimed that all of the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>While the contemporary expert <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Bāqir al-Īrawānī even mentions this is as the actual reason behind their rejection of the categorization:</p>



<p>وسبب إنكار الأخباريين لهذا التقسيم أن جميع اخبار الكتب الأربعة صحيحة ويجب العمل بها بنظرهم</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The reason behind the rejection of this categorization of narrations by the<em> A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> is: According to their view, <u>all the reports in the Four Books are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and it is necessary to practice upon them</u>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>This group of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, that considers all the narrations in the Four Books to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, includes renowned figures who marked their names as major scholars of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u>ūn</em>] and jurisprudence [<em>fuqahā’</em>] among them.

<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> `Abbās al-Qummī (d. 1359), who was a renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and biographer, has written under the biography of al-Ĥurr:</p>

He has extensively argued in favour of this position of his in the same compilation mentioned by `Abbās al-Qummī as “the ocean that can not be contested,” <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>.</p>



<p>al-Īrawānī says:</p>

<p><strong>“</strong><strong>In his <em>Wasā’il</em>, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī has gathered the evidences indicating that—meaning, the authenticity of whatever is in the Four Books—and they are (a total of) twenty two evidences.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he did not just stop at simply viewing other works of narrations to be entirely correct, but he also believed that his own compiled work, <em>Wasā’il al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, contained only authentic and correct narrations.</p>



<p>al-Ghurayfī writes while mentioning how the <em>A<u>kh</u>bārīs</em> have argued against the categorization:</p>

<p>نبغ من أصحاب الصادق جم غفير وعدد كثير كانوا أئمة هدى ومصابيح دجى وبحار علم ونجوم هداية والذين دونت أسماؤهم وأحوالهم في كتب التراجم منهم أربعة آلاف رجل من العراق والحجاز وفارس وسوريا وهم أولو مصنفات مشهورة لدى علماء الإمامية ومن جملتها الأصول الأربعة مئة وهي كما ذكرناه سابقا أربع مئة مصنف لأربع مئة مصنف كتبت من فتاوى الصادق عليه السلام على عهده فكان عليها مدار العلم والعمل من بعده حتى لخصها جماعة من أعلام الأمة وسفراء الأئمة في كتب خاصة تسهيلا للطالب وتقريبا على المتناول وأحسن ما جمع منها الكتب الأربعة التي هي مرجع الإمامية في أصولهم وفروعهم من الصدر الأول إلى هذا الزمان وهي الكافي والتهذيب والاستبصار ومن لا يحضره الفقيه وهي متواترة ومضامينها مقطوع بصحتها والكافي أقدمها وأعظمها وأحسنها وأتقنها</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>A great portion and large number from the companions of al-Şādiq (as) achieved ultimate wisdom. They became leaders [<em>imāms</em>] of right path, lanterns in darkness, oceans of knowledge, and stars of guidance. Among those, who have their names and conditions recorded in biographical texts, are four thousand men from Iraq, the Ĥijāz, Persia, and Syria. They are authors of famous works, which include the four hundred <em>Uşūls</em> of the <em>Imāmīs</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These (<em>Uşūls</em>)—as we mentioned earlier—are four hundred compilations authored by four hundred authors, which were written during the time of al-Şādiq (as) and contained his verdicts. They were the axis of knowledge and practice after him, to such an extent that a group of eminent scholars of this nation and ambassadors of the <em>Imāms</em> rendered them into books as a facilitation and summarization for the seeker and deriver of knowledge.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The best of what was compiled from the (<em>Uşūls</em>) are the Four Books, which are sources for the <em>Imāmīs</em> in referring to their roots and branches of religion, from their earliest period to this era.&nbsp; These are: <em>al-Kāfī</em>, <em>al-Ta<u>hd</u>hīb</em>, <em>al-Istibşār</em> and <em>Man lā Yaĥđuruh al-Faqīh</em>. They are transmitted consecutively and their <u>contents are undoubtedly authentic</u>, and <em>al-Kāfī</em> is the oldest, the greatest, the best and the most accurate among them.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>On the other hand, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr even went to the extent of explicitly stating in his book entitled <em>al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>:</p>



<p>أن الشيعة وإن كانت مجمعة على اعتبار الكتب الأربعة وقائلة بصحة كل ما فيها من روايات غير أنها لا تطلق عليها اسم الصحاح كما فعل ذلك إخوانهم أهل السنة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The <em><u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, even though they are unanimous upon the reliability of the Four Books and believe in the authenticity of all the narrations in them, do not name them<em> ‘</em><em>Şiĥāĥ</em><em>’</em> as their <em>Ahl al-Sunna</em> brothers did.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-<u>Sh</u>ī`a</em>, of Muĥammad Şādiq al-Şadr (d. 1419), page 127 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>And last but not least, a scholar before these two individuals who also held that all the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> are correct, was one of the renowned <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> jurisprudents of his time, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Mīrzā Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī (d. 1355). His belief in the correctness of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> reached such a degree that he declared checking their chains of transmission to be a waste of time.</p>



<p>His student, Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Abū al-Qāsim al-Khū’ī (d. 1412) writes:</p>



<p>وقد ذكر غير واحد من الاعلام أن روايات الكافي كلها صحيحة ولا مجال لرمي شئ منها بضعف سندها وسمعت شيخنا الأستاذ الشيخ محمد حسين النائيني قدس سره في مجلس بحثه يقول إن المناقشة في إسناد روايات الكافي حرفة العاجز</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong><u>More than one of the eminent scholars have mentioned that all the narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> are <em>şaĥīĥ</em></u></strong><strong>, and there is no room for putting away anything from it due to its weak chain of transmission. I heard our master and teacher <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Muĥammad Ĥusayn al-Nā’īnī—may Allāh sanctify his secret—say in one of his gatherings of discussion: ‘Verily, arguing about the chains of transmission of the narrations in <em>al-Kāfī</em> is the vocation of an incompetent!’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It becomes crystal clear from all the quotes cited above that a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars consider all the narrations in the Four Books authentic and <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. Specially the narrations found in the most authoritative of the four, <em>al-Kāfī</em>.</p>



<p>Yet the Answering-Ansar team chose to deceptively say:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Qummī (d. 307) and his <em>Tafsīr</em></h2>



<p>A celebrated <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar of this era, <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid `Alī al-Shahrastānī, reveals in his book studying the recording of narrations:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>`Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummiy, the compiler of the famous book of Tafsir that carries his name, <u>has confirmed the authenticity of the Hadiths that he recorded in his book</u> by bearing out that these Hadiths have been reported by trustworthy narrators from the Holy Imams.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The Prohibition of Recording the Hadith: Causes and Effects (English)</em>, of Sayyid Ali al-Shahristaniy, page 510 [Qum]</li>
</ul>



<p>As it is evident, `Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī, who was a major scholar and teacher of al-Kulaynī, also confirmed that the narrations in his Commentary of the Holy Qur’ān are authentic. This, consequently, means that he himself also believed that the narrations in his work are authentic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Ĥillī (d. 726), al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī (d. 1011) and Compilation of Authentic Narrations</h2>



<p>Ibn Muţahhar al-Ĥillī, a major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar who is recognized as a reformer of his era among them, even compiled works of narrations in which he collected only authentic narrations. One in which he collected only rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] and fairly authentic [<em>ĥasan</em>] narrations, and another in which he collected only <em>şaĥīĥ</em> narrations.</p>



<p>According to his own work <em><u>Kh</u>ulāsat al-Aqwāl</em>, he named these two compilations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Durr wa al-Marjān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Pearls and Corals: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em> [“The Articulate Method: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> Narrations”]</li>
</ul>



<p>These compilations of narrations are unanimously counted as al-Ĥillī’s books and as it is obvious from the titles, al-Ĥillī believed all the narrations in it are sound and acceptable.</p>



<p>The compilations of al-Ĥillī influenced another famous <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar, al-Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-`Āmilī, and lead him to also author a compilation of narrations from the Four Books that were authentic and acceptable. He titled this work <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em> [“Selected Pearls: <em>Şaĥīĥ</em> and <em>Ĥasan</em> Narrations”]</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> Āqā Buzurg al-Ţihrānī (d. 1389) writes about this when discussing the first work of al-Ĥillī in his biographical lexicon of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> texts, <em>al-<u>Dh</u>arī`a</em>:</p>



<p>وقد اقتفى اثره سميه الشيخ حسن بن زين الدين الشهيد صاحب المعالم المتوفى ١٠١١ وصنف كتابه منتقى الجمان في الأحاديث الصحاح والحسان وسيأتي في النون كتاب آخر للعلامة الحلي في هذا الموضوع اسمه النهج الوضاح في الأحاديث الصحاح</p>



<p><strong>“The namesake <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Ĥasan ibn Zayn al-Dīn al-<u>Sh</u>ahīd (d. 1011), the author of al-Ma`ālim, </strong><strong>has followed his [i.e. al-Ĥillī’s] track and authored his book <em>Muntaqá al-Jumān fī</em> <em>al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ wa al-Ĥisān</em>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Soon, another book of al-`Allāma al-Ĥillī on this subject will be mentioned under the letter <em>‘</em><em>nūn</em>.<em>’</em> Its title is: <em>al-Nahj al-Wađđāĥ fī al-Aĥādī<u>th</u> al-Şiĥāĥ</em>.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

</ul>



<p>This work is retained by contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars, unlike the two works of al-Ĥillī, and used by them as an authoritative work of reference.</p>



<p>Furthermore, not only did Ĥasan claim that the narrations in his compilation are authentic and acceptable; he also believed that the entire contents of the Four Books are authentic.</p>



<p>al-Shahrastānī states:</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>Shaykh Hasan, in his books entitled Muntaqa al-Juman and al-Ma`alim, has stated that the Hadiths mentioned in the four most reliable Shi`ite reference books of Hadith (<em>al-Kutub al-Arba`ah</em>) and their likes are substantiated by proofs as they were, without any distortion, quoted from the al-Usul as well as the fundamental books the authenticity of which have been unanimously confirmed by the scholars.”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">al-Kaf`amī (d. 905) and <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em></h2>



<p>Texts on narrations and commentaries aside, even compilations of supplications have been confirmed to be entirely authentic by some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars. Taqī al-Dīn al-Kaf`amī, a well-known and respected <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholar, has compiled a book of narrated supplications that is famously known as <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em>.</p>



<p><em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Ja`far Murtađá al-`Āmilī writes about it while citing it as a proof for his arguments:</p>



<p>ما ذكره الشيخ الكفعمي المتوفي سنة ٩٠٥ ه&#x200d; ق في كتابه المصباح الذي جمعه من حوالي مئتين وأربعين كتابا وقال إنه جمعه من كتب معتمد على صحتها مأمور بالتمسك بوثقى عروتها ولا يغيرها كر العصرين ولا مر الملوين كتب كمثل الشمس يكتب ضوؤها ومحلها فوق الرفيع الأرفع</p>



<p><strong>“10: W</strong><strong>hat is mentioned by <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em></strong><strong> al-Kaf`ami (d. 905) in his book titled <em>al-Mişbāĥ</em> which he compiled from about two hundred and forty books. He said that he compiled it ‘from books the authenticity of which is reliable and upholding them mandated, and this cannot be altered by the evil efforts of time or by the endeavour of those with twisted minds. Books, like the sun, whose light—is written above the most high of the height.’”</strong><strong></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em></h2>



<p>The Answering-Ansar team has said:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td>No Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.sunnidefense.com/exp/sites/default/files/tahreef_alquran_4.gif" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow"></a><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">Who believes the Quran has been a victim of Tahreef?</a></em><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035630/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/tahreef/en/chap2.php" rel="noreferrer noopener external nofollow">, page 4</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, truth is at odds with Answering-Ansar today.</p>



<p>Ibn Bābawayh, al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī and other scholars’ claim that all the narrations compiled in their works are correct and <em>şaĥīĥ</em> is already showed above. But to cap it all off, let us share one last work of a recognized <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who “claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.”</p>



<p>The contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī has compiled an entire work entitled <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. al-Bahbūdī has claimed to have collected <strong>only</strong> rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> in this compilation, and accordingly, he has named it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.”</p>



<p>To begin with, it should be known that al-Bahbūdī is not a typical graduate of some <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> institution, rather he is a reputed and praised scholar of today.</p>



<p>Grand <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Shihāb al-Dīn al-Mar`ashī (d. 1411) attributes the following words to al-Bahbūdī in his introduction to a work revised and edited by the latter, <em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm</em> of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877):</p>



<p>وقام العالم الفاضل الموفق لإحياء الزبر الدينية الاقا محمد باقر البهبودي شكر الله مساعيه ووفر معاليه بتصحيحه وتنقيحه بالمراجعة إلى النسخ العديدة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>The brilliant scholar, who was victorious in reviving the religious scriptures, Master Muĥammad Bāqir al-Bahbūdī—may Allāh appreciate his efforts and increase his loftiness—came forth with its correction and critical revision by referring to several manuscripts.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>al-Şirāţ al-Mustaqīm ilá Mustaĥiqqī al-Taqdīm</em>, of `Alī ibn Yūnus al-Bayāđī (d. 877), volume 1, page 4 [Tehran]</li>
</ul>



<p>This al-Bahbūdī is the one mentioned by the <em>Āyat Allāh</em> al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428) in the following words:</p>



<p>وقد ألف أحد الباحثين في عصرنا صحيح الكافي اعتبر من مجموع ١٦١٢١ حديثا من أحاديث الكافي ٣٣٢٨ حديثا صحيحا وترك ١١٦٩٣ حديثا منها لم يراها حسب اجتهاده صحيحة</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><strong>One of the researchers of our time has compiled <em>‘</em><em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>.<em>’</em> He counted 3328 narrations from the 16121 narrations of <em>al-Kāfī</em> as <em>şāĥīĥ</em>, and left 11693 narrations that he did not view to be <em>şaĥīĥ</em> according to his judgement.”</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Ma`ālim al-Madrasatayn</em>, of al-Sayyid Murtađá al-`Askarī (d. 1428), volume 3, page 282 [Beirut]</li>
</ul>



<p>The existence of this compilation not only exposes Answering-Ansar’s lie, but also shows the dubiousness of the argument reiterated by the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> propagandists of today:</p>



<p><strong>“According to us, only the Qur’ān is <em>şaĥīĥ</em>. We do not call any book <em>‘</em><em>şaĥīĥ</em><em>’</em> other than the Qur’ān as the <em>Sunnīs</em> do with <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em>.”</strong></p>



<p>Any unbiased individual can see that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em> is not very different from <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em>. The authors both compiled their respected works with the intention of solely collecting narrations that were rigorously authentic [<em>şaĥīĥ</em>] according to them. The only difference is that what <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars are trying to do today, was done centuries ago by <em>Sunnīs</em>.</p>



<p>Neither do <em>Sunnīs</em> believe that <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bukhārī</em> is <em>şaĥīĥ</em> as the Qur’ān is, nor do they intent to raise the rank of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Bu<u>kh</u>ārī</em> as high as the Qur’ān. Rather, what they mean by calling it “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>” is exactly what al-Bahbūdī meant when calling his compilation “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>.” So if the <em><u>Sh</u>ī`īs</em> are unable to unanimously agree upon a certain criterion of judging narrations, are the <em>Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jamā`a</em> to be accused of elevating a book to the position of the Holy Qur’ān for simply agreeing upon the authenticity of the narrations in a book called “<em>Şaĥīĥ</em>”?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion – Facts that Prove the Lies of Answering-Ansar</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the abovementioned study of both early and contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts reveals the following facts about their scholars:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abū Ja`far al-Kulaynī believed and confirmed that all the narrations in his compilation are correct.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Many prominent and eminent <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars claim that all the narrations in the Four Books, and particularly <em>al-Kāfī</em>, are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥurr al-`Āmilī, a scholar of narrations [<em>muĥaddi<u>th</u></em>] and jurist [<em>faqīh</em>], claimed that all of the narrations compiled in his book are <em>şaĥīĥ</em> and thus it is obligatory to practice upon them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>`Alī ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qummī confirmed the authenticity of all the narrations in his <em>Tafsīr</em>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>al-Ĥasan al-`Āmilī, the author of al-Ma`ālim, followed al-Ĥillī and also compiled a work in which he collected only authentic and acceptable narrations.</li>

<p>In light of the facts above, we have the following statement of the Answering-Ansar team:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Quoting Answering-Ansar:</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Point: No one amongst the Shia ulema claimed his hadith book as 100 % correct</strong><br>Those people who after reading some traditions in the hadith books written by Shia Ulema criticize Shia of Ali [as] are fact fanatics that have abandoned all aspects of justice since no Shia author ever claimed that all of the hadiths compiled in his book were correct and Sahih.

<p>Now, it is up to the readers to decide whether what Answering-Ansar has said is a lie or not.</p>



<p>Readers should also know that this lengthy discussion could have been successfully dealt by proving the mere existence of <em>Şaĥīĥ al-Kāfī</em>. After all, al-Bahbūdī is a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar and author who compiled a book declaring that all the narrations in it are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>, while Answering-Ansar blatantly lies by saying “no one among the Shia ulema” did such a thing.</p>



<p>However, several <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> texts have been cited for readers to realize that this not a simple a matter related to a single text, rather a prominent amount of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been believing and declaring the authenticity of all the narrations in particular texts, to the extent that a group of major <em>I<u>th</u>nā’ `A<u>sh</u>arī</em> scholars even denied the late categorization of narrations to uphold their belief that all the narrations in the “Four Books” are <em>şaĥīĥ</em>.</p>



<p>Thus, it was not just shown that Answering-Ansar has simply lied because there are contemporary <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars who have testified to the authenticity of the narrations in their books, but that the Answering-Ansar team is deceptively trying to keep people in the dark about how many <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholars have been viewing their texts throughout history, by lying.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Few Points to Note</h2>



<p>Lastly, a few points about the quote of the Answering-Ansar team should also be noted here:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They have mentioned a <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> scholar by the name of:<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>محمد جواد معتية</p>



<p>“Muhammad Jawwad <strong>Ma`tiya</strong>.”</p>



<p>Poor plagiarism. The late scholar’s actual name is:</p>



<p>محمد جواد مغنية</p>



<p>Muĥammad Jawād <strong>Mu<u>gh</u>niyya</strong>.</p>



<p>Had the Answering-Ansar team known the scholar they are copying information about, they would not have confused the diacritical points and made this ignorant mistake.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One of the categories of <em><u>Sh</u>ī`ī</em> narrations is mentioned as “Mawthiq,” whereas the actual word is “<em>muwa<u>thth</u>aq</em>” [authenticated]. <em>Mawthiq</em> refers to a covenant or a contract, not to mention that it is morphologically incorrect to use it for a narration. This clearly shows how much knowledge of the Arabic language and their own narrations is possessed by the pinnacles behind Answering-Ansar.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our advice to the Answering-Ansar team is that they should pick up a few Arabic text books for beginners before they discuss the sensitive issue of distortion of the Holy Qur’ān, a book of eloquent Arabic.</p>



<p>It is only Allah (swt) who gives success, and blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, his Pure Progeny and his Noble Companions</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><strong>The Narration “Ali is Siddiq Akbar”</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Analysis of the chain and text of the alleged statement of &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and refutation of the arguments made to authenticate it.</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>By</em></strong><br><strong><em>Abu Sumayyah Moin</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام علي رسوله الأمين</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This article is to discuss the status of the narration which says that ‘Ali b. Abi Talib said, “I am <em>As-Siddiq al-Akbar</em> [the greatest Siddiq].”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Was ‘Ali ever referred to as “<em>As-Siddiq al-Akbar”</em>?</strong></h4>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The simple answer is No. If ‘Ali had ever called himself a Siddiq then this would have been a famous title among his companions and early followers. However, this was not the case and it only came to screen after people started referring to Abu Bakr as a Siddiq.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This narration with this wording comes as a statement of ‘Ali, which is more famous, and also as a saying of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam). The Marfu’ version is different and it did not get enough fame.&nbsp; The Marfu’ version is only restricted to Hadith collections which are well known for including all kind of weak and fabricated narrations along with authentic ones. However, the Mawquf tradition, which is a statement of ‘Ali, made its way into the Sunan of Ibn Majah, which is sixth of the six major Hadith collection, and Fadail as-Sahaba of Imam Ahmad even though he excluded it from Musnad as he considered it a Munkar narration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I will only touch the alleged statement of ‘Ali as it is the most widely used on this topic. The Marfu’ narrations are not that famous and weaknesses in these narrations are very obvious to any person who has even slightly smelled the fragrance of this ‘Ilm.</p>



<p>&nbsp;‘Ali b. Abi Talib (ra) allegedly uttered it on the pulpit in the Masjid of Basrah. It has been narrated through two different routes both of which are severely weak due to its chain and also text. This article is split into two sections:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Discussion on the Sanad of this narration</li><li>Discussion on its text (Matan).</li></ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Section-1: Analyzing the chains of the narration</strong></h4>



<p>This narration has reached us with two different chains. Both are different chains but they are describing the same incident.</p>



<p><strong>First Chain: ‘Abbad b. ‘Abdullah narrating from ‘Ali (ra)</strong></p>



<p>It has been narrated through Minhal bin ‘Amr from ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah that ‘Ali bin Abi Talib said:</p>



<p>أَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ وَأَخُو رَسُولِهِ وَأَنَا الصِّدِّيقُ الْأَكْبَرُ , لَا يَقُولُهَا بَعْدِي إِلَّا كَذَّابٌ مُفْتَرٍ , وَلَقَدْ صَلَّيْتُ قَبْلَ النَّاسِ بِسَبْعِ سِنِينَ</p>



<p>“I am servant of Allah and the brother of the Messenger of Allah. I am “As-Siddiq Al-Akbar”, no one will say it after me except a liar and a slanderer. I prayed seven years before people.” [Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaiba (32084), Fadail as-Sahaba by Ahmad (993), Sunan Ibn Majah (120), As-Sunah al-Kubra by Nasai (8338), As-Sunnah by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim (1324), Al-Mustadrak by Al-Hakim (4584)]</p>



<p>This narration is Munkar and rejected due to its Sanad and Matan. The text of the narration will be discussed at the end along with the scholarly verdicts on this narration.</p>



<p><strong><em>Narrator: ‘Abbad b. Abdullah al-Kufi</em></strong></p>



<p>The problem in this chain is the narrator ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah al-Kufi. Imam ‘Ali b. Al-Madini said regarding him:</p>



<p>“He is weak in narrations.” [Al-Mawdu’aat by Ibn al-Jawzi (1/341), Meezan al-I’itidal (2/368) Tahdhib at-Tahdhib (5/98)]</p>



<p>Al-Bukhari said regarding him:</p>



<p>“There is problem in him [Feehi nazar].” [At-Tarikh al-Kabeer (6/33), Meezan al-I’itidal]</p>



<p>Ibn ‘Adi quoted the criticism of al-Bukhari with affirmation. [Al-Kamil (5/553)]</p>



<p>Similarly, al-‘Uqaili and Ibn Jarud included ‘Abbad among weak narrators. [Al-Du’afa (3/137) by al-‘Uqaili, Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal (7/177)]</p>



<p>That is why Al-Dhahabi concluded and said, ‘They abandoned him’, and Ibn Hajar said that he was weak. [Al-Kashif (2569), Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.3136)]</p>



<p>This is besides the fact that Ibn Hibban and Al-‘Ijli included this narrator among the Thiqaat. But still Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajar did not give weight to their Tawthiq and declared ‘Abbad to be untrustworthy. [See Tawthiq of Ibn Hibban in Thiqat (5/141) and that of al-‘Ijli in his Thiqaat (2/17)]</p>



<p>However, some people still managed declaring ‘Abbad to be Thiqah. The points made to defend this narrator are as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The statement of Bukhari is not a severe criticism.</li><li>Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any praise or criticism against him therefore this necessitates Ta’deel.</li><li>Al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban both declared him Thiqah.</li><li>The criticism against him is unexplained therefore praise must be preferred.</li></ol>



<p>Let us discuss all these arguments one by one.</p>



<p><strong><em>The statement of Bukhari “Feehi nazar”</em></strong></p>



<p>Imam Bukhari was well known for not using harsh words while criticizing a narrator. Hence, we see him often criticize a narrator with terms like “feehi nazar”, “Sakatu ‘anhu” [They stayed silent on him] and “Munkar al-Hadith”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vast majority of scholars feel that the term “Feehi nazar” indicates severe criticism from the perspective of Imam Bukhari. These scholars include Hafiz Dhahabi, Al-‘Iraqi, As-Suyuti, Ibn Katheer and As-Sakhawi. On the other hand there are some contemporaries who held that it may or may not mean severe criticism but they all agree that this term is used for weak narrators.</p>



<p>‘Abdul Hayy al-Lukhnawi says in “Ar-Rafa’ wa at-Takmil” (p.388):</p>



<p>قوا البُخَارِيّ فِي حق اُحْدُ من الروَاة فِيهِ نظر يدل على انه مُتَّهم عِنْده وَلَا كَذَلِك عِنْد غَيره</p>



<p>قَالَ الذَّهَبِيّ فِي مِيزَانه فِي تَرْجَمَة عبد الله بن دَاوُد الوَاسِطِيّ قَالَ البُخَارِيّ فِيهِ نظر وَلَا يَقُول هَذَا الا فِيمَن يتهمه غَالِبا</p>



<p>“The statement of Bukhari “<em>Feehi Nazar</em>” regarding a narrator shows that he is an accused narrator according to him. But this is not with other scholars. Al-Dhahabi says in Meezan in the entry of ‘Abdullah bin Dawud al-Wasiti: Bukhari says “Feehi nazar” and he does not say this, most of the times, except with those narrators whom he accuses…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hafiz al-Mizzi, in the entry of the narrator ‘Abdul Karim bin Abil Makhariq, quotes Hafiz Abu Muhammad Al-Ishbili who said:</p>



<p>لأنه قد قال في &#8220;التاريخ&#8221;: كل من لم أبين فيه جرحه فهو على الاحتمال، وإذا قلت: فيه نظر، فلا يحتمل</p>



<p>“Imam Bukhari said in “Tarikh”: All narrators regarding whom I did not mention any criticism then they have the possibilities (to be accepted for consideration), and when I say “Feehi nazar” then there is no possibility (for his narration to be accepted).” [Tahdheeb al-Kamal (18/265)]</p>



<p>This statement indicates that all such narrators were not acceptable according to Imam Bukhari. This is also evident when we see that Al-Bukhari have included many well known narrators who had some weakness but he did not criticize them in his Tarikh. See for example: Isma’eel bin Rafi’ al-Madani, Ayyub b. Jabir Al-Yamami, ‘Abdullah b. Muslim b. Hurmuz, ‘Ali b. Zaid b. Jud’aan and many others. So it suggests us that Al-Bukhari felt to use this criticism only when the weakness of the narrator was severe according to him. Allah knows best.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>The “silence of Ibn Abi Hatim”</em></strong></p>



<p>Some scholars of recent time have claimed that the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim in the book “al-Jarh wa at-Ta’deel” is equivalent to praise [تعديل]. It was claimed by Shaykh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah where he was inspired by some Indian scholar. So according to these scholars if Ibn Abi Hatim listed a narrator in his book but did not mention Jarh then it would mean it is a “Ta’deel” from him. However, this is a very odd opinion and goes against vast majority of other scholars who were authority in this field. In fact this even goes against the apparent opinion of Ibn Abi Hatim himself. He says in Muqaddima of his book:&nbsp;</p>



<p>على أنا قد ذكرنا أسامي كثيرة مهملة من الجرح والتعديل كتبناها ليشتمل الكتاب على كل من روى عنه العلم رجاء وجود الجرح والتعديل فيهم فنحن ملحقوها بهم من بعد إن شاء الله تعالى</p>



<p>“And we have also mentioned narrators without any statement of criticism or praise so as to include everyone in this books from whom knowledge [Hadith] has been narrated while expecting the occurrence of praise or criticism [regarding them]. So we will add it later if Allah willed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is clear from this quote that Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any ruling on some narrators only because he was not aware of their status. So they were more like “Mastur” or “Majhul” according to him. But if any criticism or praise found regarding such narrators from other scholars then his silence carry no weight as it was based merely on the lack of information.</p>



<p>This was also the view of <em>Hafiz Ibn Hajar</em> with regards to the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. In fact if we compare his methodology in this regard with different narrators we see the ruling of Hafiz changes as per his evaluation of such narrators from declaring the narrators Mastur to calling them Majhul. But he never considered such a narrator to be Thiqah only based on the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. Hence he says in “Al-Nukat” (2/769) regardin Ibn ‘Abdullah b. Mughaffal:</p>



<p><strong>فقد ذكره البخاري في &#8220;تأريخه&#8221; فسماه: يزيد ولم يذكر فيه هو ولا ابن أبي حاتم جرحا، فهو مستور&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Bukhari has mentioned him in his Tareekh and named him Yazid. Neither he nor Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned any criticism against him. Therefore he is “Mastur”…”</p>



<p>On the other hand, he declared the narrator Shaqiq Abu Laith to be Majhul even though Ibn Abi Hatim listed him in his book without any Jarh or Ta’deel, and no other scholars made criticism against him.&nbsp; [See his entry in “Taqrib at-Tahdhib]</p>



<p>Some people claim that Ibn Hajar was of the opinion that silence of Ibn Abi Hatim in his book amounts to Ta’deel. Here are some of the examples which are generally brought to make this claim along with our response to it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Hasan b. Mudrik al-As-Sadusi: Abu Dawud, in the report of Abu ‘Ubaid al-Aajurri, said that he was a liar. Hafiz Ibn Hajar responded by saying that Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah wrote narrations from him but did not point out any criticism against him. [Fath al-Bari (1/397, Muqaddimah). So they say that since Ibn Hajar rejected Abu Dawud’s criticism based on the silence of Abu Zur’ah and Abu Hatim therefore he deemed their silence to be Ta’deel. However this is not the case. If we go back to the reference, we find that Ibn Hajar in fact refuted the Jarh by showing the cause of Jarh is not valid. Along with that he mentioned Nasai who said regarding Hasan that there is no problem in him (لا بأس به). Ibn ‘Adi said he was from the Huffaz of Basrah. Besides that he was from the Shuyukh of Abu Hatim and Abu Zur’ah and they were known for avoiding abandoned narrators. All these facts made Ibn Hajar to reject the criticism of Abu Dawud.</li><li>Iyas b. ‘Afeef: Bukhari said regarding him, “Feehi Nazar”. Hafiz Ibn Hajar added after the comment of Bukhari that Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him in his book but did not mention any criticism. [Lisan (2/232)]. So these people assumed that Ibn Hajar is rejecting the criticism of Bukhari by mentioning the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim. However, Ibn Hajar did not say any such thing. Through out of his book Lisan al-Meezan he has the habit of quoting Ibn Abi Hatim along with this comment if no Jarh or Ta’deel is found in his book. In fact after few pages (2/234) of the same book Hafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned a narrator Ayman. He declared him Majhul even though he also mentioned the same thing regarding him that Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention any criticism regarding him. This makes his methodology even more clear.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><em>Hafiz Ibn Katheer </em>also deemed such narrators to be Mastur. He said regarding a narrator Musa bin Jubair in his Tafseer [al-Baqarah 2:102]:</p>



<p><strong>وَذَكَرَهُ ابْنُ أَبِي حَاتِمٍ فِي كِتَابِ الْجَرْحِ وَالتَّعْدِيلِ، وَلَمْ يحك فيه شيئًامِنْ هَذَا وَلَا هَذَا، فَهُوَ مَسْتُورُ الْحَالِ</strong></p>



<p>“And Ibn Abi Hatim has mentioned him in his book ‘Al-Jarh wa al-Ta’deel’ and did not report either of the verdicts regarding him, therefore he is Mastur al-Haal…”</p>



<p>Hafiz Dhahabi was even more to the point and he would call a narrator Majhul only based on the silence of Ibn Abi Hatim about the narrator as long as there is no other praise available in his favour. Same was the view of Hafiz Ibn Qattan. So we see there is hardly any Hadith specialist in past that held such views and even worse this view goes against Ibn Abi Hatim’s own comment.</p>



<p><em>After all this it should also be clear that this debate is only about those narrators who were neither criticized nor praised by any other Imam of this field</em>. If there is any criticism or praise available on such narrators then the discussion of silence is not applicable in the first place like in the case of ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah. Therefore, those people who try to elevate ‘Abbad to the level of reliability are wrong in both of these conditions.</p>



<p><strong><em>The praise from al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban</em></strong></p>



<p>The dispute regarding the leniency of al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban are well known among scholars of Hadith. While the leniency of Ibn Hibban was well knows since he himself explained it, however this was not the case with Al-‘Ijli as he did not explained his methodology. Al-Mu’allimi was the one who argued first that al-‘Ijli was lenient in this regard. The leniency of al-‘Ijli has been claimed on the following issues:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>His Tawthiq of several narrators who were Majhul. In this he was said to have on the same methodology as of Ibn Hibban.</li><li>His Tawthiq of narrators who were widely criticized by other scholars.</li></ol>



<p>Later shaykh Albani also held this view and people then widely followed their view as they found it closer to reality. Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Aleem Bastawi, who edited and published the book of Al-‘Ijli, also concluded that he had methodology similar to Ibn Hibban in strengthening unknown and those narrators regarding whom they did not receive any criticism. Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Aleem mentioned several examples of such narrators.</p>



<p>In this case, the Tawthiq of Ibn Hibban and Al-‘Ijli for the narrator ‘Abbad bin ‘Abdullah is rejected not only because they were lenient in their methodology but also due to the fact that their views here contradict majority of experts of this field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Abbad basically is from the narrators who would generally be considered unknown. If we look at the entries of ‘Abbad in different books we can easily conclude:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Only Minhal bin ‘Amr narrate from him.</li><li>He has very few narrations.</li><li>Nothing is known about him except his name and where he lived.</li></ol>



<p>So he was a real fit to be called a Majhul narrator, and hence they were acceptable as per the methodology of al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban since they did not come across criticism against him nor they saw a Munkar tradition of ‘Abbad. But this unknown narrator was further degraded to the level of unreliable narrators due to the comment of Imam Bukhari, Ibn al-Madini, Ibn ‘Adi and others. Therefore, it is illogical to rely on the views of these two instead of those who criticized ‘Abbad especially when we see most of ‘Abbad’s narrations are Munkar and not similar to the narrations of Thiqaat.</p>



<p><strong><em>Comparison between praise and criticism</em></strong></p>



<p>Those who criticized ‘Abbad b. Abdullah are: [1] ‘Ali b. Madini [2] Al-Bukhari [3] Abu Ja’far al-‘Uqaili [4] Ibn ‘Adi. Those who declared his to be Thiqah are: [1] Al-‘Ijli [2] Ibn Hibban.</p>



<p>Since, we have already seen that the Tawthiq of Al-‘Ijli and Ibn Hibban are based on a methodology which was specific to these two scholars and not acceptable to other scholars of Hadith hence the principle of preferring praise over unexplained Jarh is not applicable in this case. Tawthiq is preferred when there are no other deciding factors and the reconciliation is difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Second Chain: Sulaiman b. ‘Abdullah narrating from Mu’adha al-‘Adawiyyah</strong></p>



<p>Another chain comes through Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah from Mu’adhah Al-‘Adawiyyah that she heard ‘Ali bin Abi Talib stating on the pulpit of Basra:</p>



<p>“I am Al-Siddiq al-Akbar. I believed before Abu Bakr believed and I accepted Islam before him.” [Al-Tarikh al-Kabir of Bukhari, Al-Aahaad wa al-Mathaani by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim (186-187), Al-Kuna by Al-Dulabi (1587), Al-Du’afa by al-‘Uqaili (2/130)]</p>



<p>Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah in this chain is Majhool. Al-Bukhari states regarding this report of Sulaiman:</p>



<p>لا يتابع عليه ولا يعرف سماغ سُلَيْمَان من معَاذة</p>



<p>“No one supports him on this and hearing of Sulaiman from Mu’adhah is not known.”&nbsp; [At-Tarikh al-Kabir (4/23)]</p>



<p>Ibn ‘Adi agreed with Al-Bukhari and said:</p>



<p>وسليمان يعرف بهذا الحديث، ولاَ أعرف له غيره ولم يتابع على هذه الرواية كما قاله البخاري</p>



<p>“Sulaiman is known through this narration (only) and I do not know any of his hadith other than this. No one supports him on this as stated by Al-Bukhari.” [Al-Kamil (4/268)]</p>



<p>Al-Dhahabi said in “Meezan” (2/212):</p>



<p>قال البخاري: لا يتابع عليه وذكره ابن عدي في الضعفاء</p>



<p>“Bukhari said, ‘No one backs his narration.’ Ibn ‘Adi mentioned him among weak narrators.”</p>



<p>So an unknown narrator narrating his only narration, which is criticized by scholars, is nothing less than a severe criticism against him.</p>



<p>Hence, Sulaiman b. ‘Abdullah was an unknown narrator. Still Ibn Hibban included him among Thiqaat due to his faulty methodology regarding such narrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>What makes a narrator Majhul?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Before I discuss this, let me make it clear again that the narrator had criticism in his favor. He had only one narration and that too was criticized by experts like Bukhari and Ibn ‘Adi. Besides that al-‘Uqaili included this narrator in book on weak narrators “Ad-Du’afa”.</em></p>



<p>A Majhul or unknown narrator is that who was not famous in field of knowledge. Later, scholars divided such narrators into different categories:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Majhul al-‘Ayn: The narrator through whom only one has person narrated and no one declared him reliable nor was he criticized.</li><li>Majhul al-Haal or Mastur: These are the narrators from whom more than one trustworthy people have taken Hadith but he was neither praised nor criticized.</li></ol>



<p>There had been a dispute among scholars of Hadith regarding the acceptance of the hadith of a Majhul al-Haal narrator. It has been accepted by some scholars like Ibn Khuzaimah and his student Ibn Hibban. However, majority of scholars do not accept it except in cases where there are other factors which indicate towards the reliability of such narrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the narrator we are discussing currently do not fit in any side of the disputed group. The narrator Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah is Majhul al-‘Ayn not Mastur since only Nuh bin Qais narrates from him as pointed out by Imam Bukhari and affirmed by Ibn ‘Adi in “al-Kamil”.</p>



<p>Al-Baladhuri brought another chain of this narration in his “Ansab al-Ashraf” (2/147) where another narrator is narrating this from Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah. Some of the innovators may use this to raise Sulaiman to the level of Mastur or Majhul al-Haal and hence making it acceptable based on the standard of some scholars. However, it is to be noted that Al-Baladhuri is a historian whose book was not served as other hadith works are served. Hence, we find several odd narrations in that book which were not known to specialists of Hadith. Even Al-Baladhuri himself was not analyzed as a narrator and hence it is hard to find any praise for him as a narrator. Since, several Hadith specialists did not acknowledge any such alternate chain for this narration or another student of Sulaiman bin ‘Abdullah therefore it is very much unlikely that Al-Baladhuri would have preserved it properly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, if we assume that the chain, which actually is a shaadh chain, has been preserved by Al-Baladhuri precisely then also it is not sufficient to raise Sulaiman to the level of Mastur. This is because the narrator here is Abu Hilal Ar-Rasibi who was a disputed narrator. While to raise a narrator from the status of Majhul al-‘Ayn at least two well known people famous for their knowledge must narrate from him. It is as described by Khateeb in “Al-Kifayah” [p.88]:</p>



<p><strong>وَأَقَلُّ مَا تَرْتَفِعُ بِهِ الْجَهَالَةُ أَنْ يَرْوِيَ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ اثْنَانِ فَصَاعِدًا مِنَ الْمَشْهُورِينَ بِالْعِلْمِ كَذَلِكَ</strong></p>



<p>“The least which raises a narrator from the level of Majhul [al-‘Ayn] is when two or more people who were well known for their knowledge narrate from him.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Does this supports the earlier chain?</em></strong></p>



<p>The simple answer to this question is No. This is because the Mutabi’ah or corroboration is only considered for those narrators whose weakness is due to their weak memory, Ikhtilat and others issues related to memory where chances of errors due to forgetfulness could be ignored if both the narrators testify the same thing. However, when a narrator’s weakness is due to his habit of lying or due to severe deterioration of the memory, or if there is lack of information about the narrator then such narrators cannot be aided by a weak narrator or another narrator of his kind. And if such narrators narrate something which has the text that is not supported by the narrations of other trustworthy narrators, then such narrations could be declared forged or falsehood as we shall see in next heading.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Section-2: Analyzing the text of the narration</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>The Narration is Munkar:</em></strong></p>



<p>As we have seen defects in the chains of these narrations, let us have a look at the text of the narration. In the narration above we can see ‘Ali b. Abi Talib calling himself the Siddiq Akbar and accusing anyone of lying who would claim to be as such after him. In the other version we even see him comparing himself with Abu Bakr and preferring himself over him. All this is against the well known characteristics of ‘Ali (ra). In this section I will enlist reasons for the Nakarah in this narration:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The first reason for the narration being Munkar is that it has been reported through chains which are not well-know chains of knowledge. In the first chain, the narrator ‘Abbad is not well known for being a companion of ‘Ali (ra). This whole chain is isolated. Similarly in the second chain an unknown person is claiming to have heard something from a Sahabiyyah which no one else ever claimed to have heard from her. The valid question here is where were all the well known Shuyukh and Rijal of Hadith when this statement was uttered on Minbar of Basra? Why this merit could not be reported by even reliable Shi’i narrators?</li><li>The second reason is the fact that the term “Siddiq Akbar” or even “Siddiq” was never known for ‘Ali. In history he was never known with this title. This is unlike Abu Bakr who was ofter referred to as a Siddiq in Hadith and History books. If there was an authentic origin of this and ‘Ali ever announced it on pulpit for himself then it would have been a common attribute of Ali and at least companions of ‘Ali would have referred him as such.&nbsp;</li><li>‘Ali was a humble person. He was never known for boasting about his own virtue unless if it was a necessity. He even never preferred himself over ‘Uthman. How come then he became so convinced of his loftiness that he started propagating his virtue through the Minbar denying it for anyone else, as if this attribute was revealed from Allah for him only.</li><li>In the first route of the narration ‘Ali reportedly said that he prayed seven years before anyone else had prayed. This is clearly a false statement. Ibn Katheer took it as evidence against the authenticity of the narration. [Al-Bidayah (4/64)]</li></ol>



<p>All these points prove that the narration is not reliable and that is why Imam Ahmad said about it:</p>



<p>“Throw it away, for it is a Munkar narration.”</p>



<p>[Al-Muntakhab min ‘Ilal al-Khallal (114) by Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mawdu’aat (1/341) by Ibn al-Jawzi]</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h4>



<p>After looking at all these points it will be clear to anyone that this narration is not acceptable. Not just the narrators in its chains are unreliable even the content of the narration is problematic. This is the reason we see that several scholars, who came across it, rejected it. Scholars who declared this narration unreliable are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Imam Ahmad said regarding this, “Throw it away for it is a Munkar Hadith.” [Al-Muntakhab min ‘Ilal al-Khallal (p.204), Al-Mawdu’aat (1/341)]</li><li>Ibn al-Jawzi al-Hanbali declared it fabricated. [Al-Mawda’aat (1/341)]</li><li>Ibn al-Jawraqani declared it falsehood (Baatil). [Al-Abateel wa al-Manakeer (1/294)]</li><li>Ibn Taymiyyah declared it fabricated. [Minhaj as-Sunnah (7/443)]</li><li>Al-Dhahabi said, “It is lie on ‘Ali.” [Meezan (2/368)]</li><li>Ibn Katheer said, “This narration is Munkar…” [Al-Bidayah (4/64)]</li></ol>



<p>Finally, with all these scholarly opinions and by looking at all the evidences discussed in this article we can easily say that this narration is Munkar or falsehood with this text. If this had been a proven virtue of ‘Ali then this would have been famous in circles of ‘Ilm and ‘Ali would have been referred as a Siddiq by his companions and early followers before the origin of extremist sects of Imamiyyah. People would have rushed to such narrators only to hear this unique narration. The lack of all this factors proves the defects in this narration.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: </p>



<p>This paper evaluates the historical authenticity of a prominent ḥadīth that is regularly cited amidst Sunnī-Shi&#8217;ite polemical discussions, the long ḥadīth of Abū Balj regarding`Alī&#8217;s merits. The significance of this Prophetic tradition stems from several clauses within it that are perceived to be aligned with Shi&#8217;ite theology and relevant to debates on the successorship of the Prophet. A careful study of this tradition, however, will demonstrate the presence of various defects in its transmission that ultimately undermine and dispel its historical authenticity.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h1>



<p>Al-Khoei’s “Al-Bayān fī Tafsīr Al-Qur`ān” is an important contemporary work that many modern Shī`a hold in high regard. However, Shī`ī works that comment on Quranic sciences are often heavily polemical. Al-Khoei’s work is not an exception. Like Al-Kūrānī’s argument that has been thoroughly refuted in a previous article, Al-Khoei presents a report with the intention of arguing that Ahlul Sunnah believe in the permissibility of replacing the words of the Quran with synonyms. In order to argue this, Al-Khoei mentions an event in which Abū Al-Dardā’ allows a man to recite a verse with a different wording.</p>



<p>Al-Khoei then goes on to criticize this position:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If what was intended with this form is that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his household) permitted the substitution of the words of the Qur`ān with other words that are similar in meaning, which is evidenced by the previous reports, then this possibility demolishes the foundations of the Quran, the everlasting miracle, the established proof upon all mankind, and leaves no doubt that this leads to neglecting the revealed Qur`ān and being careless towards it.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, Al-Khoei is merely attacking a straw man since this has never been acknowledged as a valid Muslim position.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Abu Al-Dardā’ and the Alternative Recitation</h1>



<p>The report has been documented through solid chains of narrations. However, some minor differences must not be overlooked.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>Ibrāhīm narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a foreigner: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em> (the <em>zaqūm</em> tree is the food of the sinner).” The foreigner found difficulty saying: “<em>Athīm</em>,” so he would say, “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm</em> (the food of orphans),” Abū Al-Dardā’ then said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-fājir</em> (the food of the wicked.)”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></li><li>Hammām narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a man: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em>,” but the man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.” </em>So when Abū Al-Dardā’ realized that he doesn’t understand, he said, “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-fājir.”<a href="#_ftn3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em></li><li>Hammām also narrates: Abū Al-Dardā’ recited to a man: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ṭa’ām al-athīm</em>,” but the man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.” </em>So Abū Al-Dardā’ said: <strong>Say</strong>: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ṭa’ām al-fājir.”</em></li><li>Hammām also narrates: A man recited to Abū Al-Dardā’: “<em>Inna shajarat al-zaqūm ta’ām al-athīm</em>.”  Abū Al-Dardā’ said: Say: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-athīm</em>.” The man said: “<em>Ṭa’ām al-yatīm.”</em> Abū Al-Dardā’ then said:<strong> Say:</strong> “<em>Ṭa’ām al-fājir.”<a href="#_ftn4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em></li></ol>



<p>The first two reports and the last two have a significant difference. In the first set, Abū Al-Dardā’ is merely saying, “<em>Ṭa’ām al-f</em><em>ājir</em>.” This can be understood as his own explanation. In the second set, Abū Al-Dardā’ explicitly commands the man: “Say: <em>Ṭa’ām al-f</em><em>ājir</em>.” The first set of reports cannot be used to suggest that Abū Al-Dardā’ is teaching a different wording.</p>



<p>In regards to the strength of the reports, they are all authentic, with the exception of the first narration by Ibrāhīm which includes two disconnections. Sa’īd bin Manṣūr reports the hadith from Al-Mughīra, who heard it from Ibrāhīm. However, Sa’īd never met Al-Mughīra, nor did Ibrāhīm hear this report from Abū Al-Dardā’, as the next three reports above indicate. The editors<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> hold the view that both disconnections were caused by scribal errors.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Either way, the report is not problematic since it is more or less identical with the second report mentioned by Sa’īd bin Manṣūr. More importantly, unlike the other reports, the first narration comes through the path of Al-Mughīra from Ibrāhīm, while all the other reports come from Al-A`amash from Ibrāhīm. Hence, it is a strong corroboration to the second report.</p>



<p>With the above in mind, it is hard to say which of the two sets of reports has the correct wording.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Motive behind the Usage of the Synonym</h1>



<p>Assuming that the second wording of the report is correct and that Abū Al-Dardā’ did indeed taught the foreigner to use a synonym, one will naturally wonder about Abū Al-Dardā’s motive.</p>



<p>The second set of reports provide no reason, while the first set provides a context where the man was a non-Arab who was unable to pronounce “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m” </em>due to his accent.</p>



<p>Abū Bakr Al-Anbārī (d. 328) comments on an identical report that mentions `Abdullāh bin Mas`ūd<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> instead of Abū Al-Dardā’: This is not proof for the ignoramuses from the people of deviation to substitute a word of the Qur`ān with another, for this was only done by `Abdullāh to bring the meaning closer to the student in a manner which prepares him to return to what is correct, to use the truth, and speak upon the word that was revealed by Allāh and what was spoken by the Messenger of Allāh (peace be upon him).<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>



<p dir=rtl>لَا حُجَّةَ فِي هَذَا لِلْجُهَّالِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الزَّيْغِ، أَنَّهُ يَجُوزُ إِبْدَالُ الْحَرْفِ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ بِغَيْرِهِ، لِأَنَّ ذَلِكَ إِنَّمَا كَانَ مِنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ تَقْرِيبًا لِلْمُتَعَلِّمِ، وَتَوْطِئَةً مِنْهُ لَهُ لِلرُّجُوعِ إِلَى الصَّوَابِ، وَاسْتِعْمَالُ الْحَقِّ وَالتَّكَلُّمِ بِالْحَرْفِ عَلَى إِنْزَالِ اللَّهِ وَحِكَايَةِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that Abū Al-Dardā’ chose to make the man recite “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-f</em><em>ā</em><em>jir”</em> since the man simply could not recite “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m</em>,” and that his using the word “wicked” as a synonym for “sinner” would at least be more in line with the Qur`ān than man’s current recitation of “the <em>zaq</em><em>ū</em><em>m </em>tree is the food of the orphans,” suggesting that orphans are guaranteed hellfire.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Abū Al-Dardā’s Methodology</h1>



<p>While building theories on a single isolated incident with variant wordings may seem foolish, it comes as a greater surprise that this is done with Abu Al-Dardā’.</p>



<p>When he was in Al-Shām, the people of the city attempted to correct his recitation. They tried to make him recite “<em>wa m</em><em>ā</em><em> khalaqa al-</em><em>ḏ</em><em>akara wal unth</em><em>ā</em><em>,”</em> Q 92:3(and by He who created the male and female) instead of “<em>wal </em><em>ḏ</em><em>akari wal unth</em><em>ā</em><em>”</em> (and by the male and the female). Abū Al-Dardā’ did not give up on the recitation that he was familiar with, nor did he tell the people of Al-Shām that the gist of both recitations were similar. Instead, he maintained his position, saying, “This is how I heard it from the Prophet (peace be upon him),” while resisting those that tried to sway him.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> This is evidence that he only recited the Qur`ān in the one way that he knew how: verbatim.</p>



<p>Abū Al-Dardā’ was someone who memorized the Qur`ān in full during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him).<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> He taught a thousand and six hundred people to recite the Qur`ān in Dimashq alone. He had placed ten of his students to teach ten others and when one of those ten mastered the recitation, he would move up to take directly from Abū Al-Dardā’.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> We do not find a trend in Dimashq of students reciting the words “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’ām al-f</em><em>ā</em><em>jir</em>” instead of “<em>ṭ</em><em>a’</em><em>ā</em><em>m al-ath</em><em>ī</em><em>m”</em> either. All we have is an isolated report about a foreigner that couldn’t pronounce the Arabic.</p>



<p>Abū Al-Dardā’ was so careful with the hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him), that when unsure of the wording, he’d say: “Or something like it,” at the end of the narration, out of fear of attributing to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that which he did not say.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>



<p>Is this who they accuse of teaching the Qur`ān using his own synonyms?!</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Al-Khoei’s hasty attempts to discredit the stance of Ahlul Sunnah, in regards to their view of the preservation of the Qur`ān, has led him to make several mistakes.</p>



<p>He opted to abuse a report that appears controversial even with the existence of another wording. He ignored the fact that the report is speaking about a very specific case that includes someone that is unable to recite the words due to his accent. Finally, his ignorance in regards to Abū Al-Dardā’ the person and his methodology had led him to making a rash conclusion.</p>



<p>To hold the view that Abu Al-Dardā’ held such a belief is unthinkable, especially with evidence as flimsy as that which Al-Khoei had presented.</p>

<p><em><span style="color:#313131" class="color">by Farid al-Bahraini</span></em></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h1>



<p>While `Alī Al-Kūrānī’s “Tadwīn Al-Qur`ān” is nothing more than a compilation of poor polemical points, one specific claim he makes is deserving of attention due to the ambiguity of the quoted phrase when taken out of context. Al-Kūrānī, due to his adherence to the Twelver school of thought, rejects the existence of the seven <em>aḥruf</em>. He refers to the concept as the “Theory of Expansion of the Qur`ānic Text.” Al-Kūrānī attempts to frame the seven <em>a</em><em>ḥruf</em> as a form of distortion.</p>



<p>Al-Kūrānī,<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> in an attempt to argue this position, presents quotations that liken the <em>tashahud</em> to the <em>Qira’āt</em>. He argues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Allāh the Most High preserved His book from the Caliph’s (`Omar) theory of expansion of His text. It only caused a disruption around the Qur`ānic text during his period. However, its remnants remained and bloomed in the school of jurisprudence of our Sunni brethren, which led their jurists to give religious edicts permitting changes in the Qur`ānic text, as well as the text of the <em>tashahud</em> in prayer, due to it being lesser in significance to the text of the Qur`ān!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Al-Kūrānī’s theorizes that Al-Shāfi’ī held the view that one could recite the Qur`ān in a non-verbatim manner, as long as the meaning is not changed. In this article, Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements will be examined within their context, in order to prevent any misrepresentation of his views.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How was the <em>Tashahud</em> Taught?</h1>



<p>Before presenting the statements that Al-Kūrānī quotes from Al-Shāfi’ī it is important to be aware of the <em>tashahud</em> and its nature.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī when discussing the topic of <em>tashahud</em> provides statements from Ibn Mas`ūd and Ibn `Abbās, both of whom explicitly state that the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught them the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way that he taught them the Qur`ān.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>This method was also observed by Companions when teaching the <em>t</em><em>ābi’</em><em>īn</em>. We find identical statements to the above being uttered by Abū Abdulraḥmān Al-Sulamī and Ibrahim Al-Nakha’ī.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>



<p>These statements suggest that the <em>tashahud</em> was learned verbatim. Al-Aswad elaborates by stating that Ibn Mas`ūd would teach them the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way that he taught the Qur`ān, correcting them if they changed something as small as an <em>alif</em> or a <em>w</em><em>āw</em>.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>



<p>Ibrāhīm Al-Nakha’ī states that he was taught the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>



<p>Abū Sa’īd Al-Khudrī mentions that the companions didn’t write what they heard from the Prophet (peace be upon him) with the exception of the Qur`ān and the <em>tashahud</em>.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> This implies that the <em>tashahud</em> was to be memorized by the companions.</p>



<p>These reports clearly show that the <em>tashahud</em> was not taught in the same manner that other <em>ḥ</em><em>ad</em><em>ī</em><em>ths</em> were taught.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Kūrānī quotes Al-Shāfi’ī</h1>



<p>Al-Kūrānī bases his arguments with on following quotations from Al-Shāfi’ī.</p>



<p dir="rtl"><br>وقد اختلف بعض أصحاب النبي في بعض لفظ القرآن عند رسول الله ولم يختلفوا في معناه فأقرهم وقال: هكذا أنزل إن هذا القرآن أنزل على سبعة أحرف فاقرؤوا ما &nbsp;تيسر منه. فما سوى القرآن من الذكر أولى أن يتسع، هذا فيه إذا لم يختلف المعنى!</p>



<p dir="rtl"><br>قال: وليس لأحد أن يعمد أن يكف عن قراءة حرف من القرآن إلا بنسيان، وهذا في التشهد وفي جميع الذكر أخف!!.</p>



<p>The first, from “Ikhtilāf Al-Hadīth”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The companions of the Prophet differed in some of the words of the Qur`ān in front of the Messenger of Allāh, and they did not differ in meaning, and he acknowledged them. He said: ‘This is how the Qur`ān was revealed, in seven <em>aḥruf</em>, so recite in whichever way you find ease.’ So anything apart from the Qur`ān, that falls under the <em>ḏikr</em>, can also be expanded upon, if the meaning is one.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>He (Al-Shāfi’ī) said: ‘It is not for one to purposefully abstain from reciting a <em>ḥarf </em>except due to forgetfulness, while with the <em>tashahud</em> or the rest of the <em>ḏikr</em> it is lesser of an issue.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Al-Kūrānī then quotes Al-Shāfi’ī through Al-Bayhaqī’s Sunan:</p>



<p dir="rtl">فإذا كان الله برأفته بخلقه أنزل كتابه على سبعة أحرف معرفة منه بأن الحفظ قد نزر ليجعل لهم قراءته وإن اختلف لفظهم فيه، كان ما سوى كتاب الله أولى أن يجوز فيه اختلاف اللفظ ما لم يخل معناه!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&nbsp;“If Allāh, due to His mercy upon His creation, revealed His book in seven <em>aḥruf</em>, due to His awareness that memories have weakened, and allowed them to recite it even though their wordings differ, then anything other than the book of Allah is more permissible to have different wordings, as long as its meaning doesn’t change.”<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This quote is taken from Al-Shāfi’ī’s Al-Risāla.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Views on the nature of the <em>Tashahud</em></h1>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī quotes the Companions saying that they were taught the <em>tashahud</em> in the same way they were taught the Qur`ān. This is significant because it suggests that the level of care that was placed into teaching the <em>tashahud</em> was greater than other <em>ḥad</em><em>īths </em>in general.</p>



<p>Anas narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would repeat a statement three times so that it could be understood.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>



<p>If this was the care with his regular speech, then it can only be assumed that the Qur`ān and the <em>tashahud</em> were taught verbatim.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī points out after speaking of variants between the <em>tashahud</em> of Ibn `Abbās, Jābir, Abū Mūsā, and Ibn Mas`ūd that “it is possible that they are all authentic and that the Messenger of Allāh taught groups and individuals the <em>tashahud</em>, and one would memorize one wording while another would memorize a different wording.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">واحتمل أن تكون كلها ثابتة، وأن يكون رسول الله يعلم الجماعة والمنفردين التشهد، فيحفظ أحدهم على لفظ ويحفظ الآخر على لفظ يخالفه.</p>



<p>He also says in Al-Risāla,<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> “All of these are words that intend the glorification of Allah and so the Messenger of Allah taught them.”</p>



<p dir="rtl">كلٌ كلامٌ أريد به تعظيم الله، فعلمهم رسول الله.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī likens the variations of the <em>tashahud</em> to <em>ṣalāt al-khawf </em>(prayers during times of danger). He explains: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“And what he says in the <em>tashahud</em> is but the glorification of Allah, and I hope that all of this is broadly acceptable, and that all the differences within are like what I’ve said, and this – as I’ve said – can occur with <em>ṣalāt al-khawf</em>, <strong>which is sufficient if performed fully in any of the methods that are narrated from the Prophet</strong>.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p></blockquote>



<p dir="rtl">فقال ما في التشهد إلا تعظيم الله، وأنّى لأرجو أن يكون كل هذا فيه واسعًا، وأن لا يكون الاختلاف فيه إلا من حيث ذكرت ومثل هذا – كما قلت – يمكن في صلاة الخوف، فيكون إذا جاء بكمال الصلاة على أي الوجوه روي عن النبي أجزأه.</p>



<p>This statement by Al-Shāfi’ī confirms that the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught multiple ways of praying <em>ṣal</em><em>āt al-khawf</em>, and by extension, also taught multiple wordings for the <em>tashahud</em>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī affirms that these multiple wordings were heard by the Prophet (peace be upon him), who acknowledged their validity, and not that the Companions were given free rein to distort the <em>tashahud</em> as they see fit.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Views on the nature of Al-<em>Qira’āt</em></h1>



<p>Before examining Al-Shāfi’ī’s views in detail, we can come to multiple conclusions in regards to Al-Shāfi’ī’s understanding of the nature of the <em>Qira’āt</em> from the passages that Al-Kūrānī quoted.</p>



<p>Firstly, Al-Shāfi’ī states clearly that one cannot “abstain from reciting a <em>ḥarf </em>except due to forgetfulness”.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In other words, one may not switch out a word with another, add to the Qur`ān, subtract from it, make changes in sentence structure, etc., intentionally.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Al-Shāfi’ī’s view is that these recitations were revealed in “seven <em>aḥruf</em>” and that they were “revealed”.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>The apparent meaning of this is that these variants are from Allāh the Almighty. Any other reinterpretation of these clear words would require strong evidence.</p>



<p>In regards to the final quotation by Al-Kūrānī, the passage is taken from Al-Risāla<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> where Al-Shāfi’ī likens the <em>tashahud</em> to the <em>aḥruf</em>, while providing an example of “expansion”. He mentions the narration of Omar bin Al-Khaṭṭāb and Hishām bin Ḥakīm bin Ḥizām, where the Prophet (peace be upon him) affirms that both recitations were revealed by Allāh the Almighty.</p>



<p>If Al-Shāfi’ī’s intention from providing this example was to demonstrate that variant recitations were intentional changes that were based on preferences, then he has chosen the absolute worst example possible.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Imām Aḥmad and the <em>Tashahud</em></h1>



<p>Linking the <em>tashahud</em> with the <em>Qira’āt</em> was not exclusive to Al-Shāfi’ī, and we find an explicit statement by Imām Aḥmad that affirms the previous conclusions above. Ibn Qudāma quotes Imām Aḥmad in al-Mughnī: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I prefer the <em>tashahud</em> of `Abdullāh (bin Mas`ūd), even though other forms are permissible, <strong>because the Prophet (peace be upon him) teaching the Companions different ways </strong>is proof that all are permissible, <strong>and it is like the different <em>Qira’āt</em></strong> that are included in the <em>muṣḥaf</em>.”<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p></blockquote>



<p dir="rtl">تشهد عبد الله أعجب إلي، وإن تشهد بغيره فهو جائز، لأن النبي – صلى الله عليه وسلم – لما علمه الصحابة مختلفًأ دل على جواز الجميع، كالقراءات المختلفة التي اشتمل عليها المصحف.</p>



<p>Even though Imām Aḥmad is not quoting Al-Shāfi’ī, it is not far-fetched that this is a proper representation of the latter’s view, since they were peers, and it is unlikely that both provided the same example without influencing one another.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Comparing the <em>Tashahud</em> to the <em>Qira’āt</em></h1>



<p>The previous sections in this article have already covered the fact that both the variants wordings of the <em>tashahud</em> and the multiple <em>Qira’āt</em> were taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him). If Al-Shāfi’ī’s intention from the comparison was to demonstrate the permissibility of recitation as per the meaning, then such a matter could have been explained using any other statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, the <em>tashahud</em> is unlike most other religious rulings, since multiple variations of it have been taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>



<p>&nbsp;Al-Shāfi’ī explains that the multiple <em>Qira’āt</em> are a mercy from Allah in order to facilitate its memorization. If the Qur`ān was limited to one form in recitation, it would be a struggle for a non-Qurashī to memorize it. Hence, the existence of <em>Qira’āt</em>, through the seven modes, which mainly include dialectal differences, provides ease.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted that much of the <em>Qira’āt</em> have nothing to do with the dialects of the Arab tribes and are incompatible with Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements above. Some of these examples will be examined below.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Non-synonymous Recitations</h1>



<p>Even though Al-Kūrānī’s quotations above are used in order to argue that Al-Shāfi’ī believed in interchangeable synonyms, this doesn’t explain the existence of variants with different meanings. Al-Shāfi’ī, aware of the recitation of <em>wa</em> <em>arjulikum</em> in Q 5:6, comments, “We read it as <em>arjulakum</em>, meaning: Wash your face, hands, and feet.”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī speaks of his preference without critiquing the other recitation as a false one, which demonstrates that he is aware of the validity of variances that do not have the same meaning. In other words, the seven <em>aḥruf</em> are not limited to synonyms as per the view of Al-Shāfi’ī. This conflicts directly with Al-Kūrānī’s understanding of the quotations that he provided.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Taqdīm wa Ta’khīr</em></h1>



<p>The nature of the <em>aḥruf</em> include additions, omissions, non-synonymous changes, as well as <em>taqd</em><em>ī</em><em>m wa ta’kh</em><em>ī</em><em>r </em>(anastrophe), in which a variant includes the same words of a verse but in a different order.</p>



<p>For example, the Uthmanic recitation of Q 50:9: “And the stupor of death with bring truth,” was revealed in one <em>ḥ</em><em>arf</em> as “and the stupor of truth will bring death.” Of course, the latter was not accommodated into the Uthmanic <em>rasm</em> and is not read today.</p>



<p>The example above is clear in the sense that the variant <em>aḥruf</em> are not necessarily synonymous. However, even when they are, word order is always significant.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī points out that one should perform ablutions in the same order as it is mentioned in Q 5:6. Similarly, he argues that one should start the ritualistic rounds between the Al-Ṣafā and Al-Marwa starting with Al-Ṣafā as per the order in Q 2:158.<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>



<p>Thus, according to Al-Shāfi’ī, the replacement of the order of nouns within a verse itself will lead to changes in the way the rituals are practiced and the slightest change in the wording of any verse will have an impact on the meaning.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">An Explicit Statement</h1>



<p>During Al-Shāfi’ī’s description of the obligations of prayer, he makes important statements about Al-Fātiḥa. He states: It is not sufficient to recite “<em>bismill</em><em>ā</em><em>h al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m</em>” after reciting “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amdulill</em><em>ā</em><em>hi rabbi al-`</em><em>ā</em><em>lam</em><em>ī</em><em>n</em>” nor within it, until he returns and recites “<em>bismill</em><em>ā</em><em>h al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m”</em> then starts Umm Al-Qur`ān (al-fātiha) while placing every letter in its position.</p>



<p dir="rtl">ولا يجزيه أن يقرأ (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم) وقرأ من (الحمد لله رب العالمين)، ولا من بين ظهرانيها، حتى يعود فيقرأ (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم) ثم يبتدئ أم القرآن فيكون قد وضع كل حرف منها في موضعه.</p>



<p>He continues: If one forgets “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>” but said “<em>lill</em><em>ā</em><em>hi rabbi al-`</em><em>ā</em><em>lam</em><em>ī</em><em>n</em>”, then returned and recited “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>” and what comes after it, it wouldn’t be sufficient unless he says it in the same way it was revealed.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">وكذلك لو أغفل (الحمد)، فقال: (لله رب العالمين) عاد فقرأ (الحمد)، وما بعدها، لا يجزيه غيره حتى يأتي بها كما أنزلت.</p>



<p>The above is explicit in that Al-Shāfi’ī does not allow one to recite according to their preferences, but rather, the order and the wording that was revealed by Allāh needs to be followed. Replacing words like “<em>al-shukr</em>” a synonym of “<em>al-</em><em>ḥ</em><em>amd</em>”, in its place, wouldn’t cut it, since “<em>al-shukr</em>” was not revealed. Saying “<em>al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n</em>” instead of “<em>al-Ra</em><em>ḥ</em><em>m</em><em>ā</em><em>n al-Ra</em><em>ḥī</em><em>m</em>” would also conflict with his earlier statement.</p>



<p>The statements of Al-Shāfi’ī here are in contradiction with Al-Kūrānī’s understanding of the quotes provided at the beginning of the article. The only way of reconciliation is by holding the view that Al-Shāfi’ī does not believe in an “expansion of the text” as per the desires of the reciters. Rather, he holds the view that the variant recitations are only limited to what was revealed by Allāh the Almighty.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Al-Shāfi’ī’s Condition for non-Verbatim Renditions of <em>Ḥadīth</em></h1>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī in Al-Risāla prohibits one from narrating a <em>ḥadīth</em> according to the meaning unless he is aware of what the meaning can lead to, for “if one narrates it according to the meaning without knowing what the meaning can lead to, he may shift what is permissible into a prohibition.”<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>



<p dir="rtl">إذا حدث به على المعنى وهو غير عالم بما يحيل معناه: لم يدر لعله يحيل الحلال إلى الحرام</p>



<p>This simple statement refutes the claim that Al-Shāfi’ī allowed the recitation of Qur`ānic verses as per their meaning, since the <em>aḥruf</em> were revealed to facilitate ease in the first place. As per an authentic <em>ḥad</em><em>īth, </em>they were revealed for the “illiterate nation among whom are the elderly woman, the old man, the boy and the girl, and the man who cannot read a book at all.”<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>



<p>In short, most <em>Qira’āt </em>variations exist for the laymen, while narrating a <em>ḥadīth </em>in a non-verbatim manner exists for the educated. This can only make sense if one holds the view that variant recitations were literally revealed by Allāh and not that they were non-verbatim renditions by laymen.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The twisted understanding of Al-Shāfi’ī’s statements cannot be traced to anyone before the year 1997. Al-Kūrānī’s polemical points fall flat due to an intentional misreading of the text and an unfamiliarity of the nature of <em>tashahud</em>.</p>



<p>Al-Shāfi’ī, like all scholars of Ahlul Sunnah, believes that the <em>Qira’āt</em> were taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and not some sort of heretical free rein “expansion of text” that Al-Kūrānī attempts to propagate. &nbsp;</p>
