<blockquote><b>A 21 page article was published yesterday (22/04/2014) by <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, "On Salafi Islam" in which he follows the way of <b>Jewish and Christian Orientalists</b> in defining 'Salafiyyah' as a modern (human) movement, lumping together "<b>quietist reformative</b>", "<b>sahwah activist</b>" and "<b>jihadi takfiri</b>" elements into a broad array of groups that identify with <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, with special denigration reserved for those referred to as "Madkhalis" and tracing <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> (in terms of the label) effectively to Muhammad Rasheed Rida and then Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>. In other writings <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, has alluded to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> as a fallible human trend (movement) like other movements (<a href=../salafis.com/indexc389.html?hpfuzdn>see article</a>).</b>    <P>
Yasir Qadhi has avoided returning to Salafi authorities (past or present) to define <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, because if he did, that would undermine the agenda he has embarked upon over the past couple of years (which serves the interests of the Orientalists and some of the astray sects). This agenda aims to erode the fact that unlike <a href='tags/judaism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Judaism</font></a> and Christianity - (because they are distorted, abrogated religions whose adherents have no extant, lasting criterion with which to judge truth from falsehood) - the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> and practice of Islam as it was revealed (particularly in matters of <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and methodology which comprise the usool, foundations) will be preserved and remain through the ages despite the splitting and deviation of a large part of the Ummah. This is unique for Islam because it is meant to be preserved until the Day of Judgement and will not be distorted or abrogated. Thus, there will always remain a path upon and around which the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> can truly unite with a genuine, actual unity (not a fake, contrived one as advocated by Qadhi and Ikhwanis like Salman al-Awdah). A unity of the hearts, in belief, speech and action, just as the Companions were united by an authentic 'Salafi' Islam (see below). Whilst Allaah has legislatively (shar'an) ordered and commanded unity in many verses, He has, alongside that, decreed splitting and differing (kawnan) <u>for a wisdom</u>, which is to determine who clings to the guidance in belief, speech and action, and who abandons the guidance in part or whole. Unity has not been  commanded for unity's sake, but unity has been commanded around authentic foundations (usool) of Islam and Sunnah. The path that Allah and His Messenger ordered, that it be clung to, with the molars, <b>has foundations, principles</b> that are laid out in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah and consolidated and preserved through the understanding and implementation of the Companions (radiyallaahu anhum). <b>This is <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. It is Islaam as it was revealed. There are areas within the religion where variation is permitted, and there are areas where differing and variation is unlawful and must be ended.</b> This definition and understanding is found in the statements of Salafi authorities past and present, including <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-al-qayyim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn al-Qayyim</font></a>, Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab, the Scholars of the da'wah of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> from Najd, and the contemporary Salafi scholars (al-Albani, Ibn Baz, Ibn al-Uthaymeen, al-Fawzaan and so on). Thus, it is from the height of <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> and injustice, that rather than quote from Salafi authorities, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> follows Jewish, Christian Orientalists in their perception of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, throwing in the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>, Ikhwanis, <a href='tags/takfiris-cd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfiris.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfiris</font></a></font></a> and others alongside them to help arrive at the misguided conclusion that <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is a fallible human trend because there are a "spectrum of conflicting views" within it. <b>This argument is as much misguided as the argument of a non-Muslim who says that Islam is a fallible human movement because of the spectrum of conflicting views therein.  Thus, just as not everyone who ascribes to Islam, is actually upon the Islam brought by the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and their areas of departure can be investigated, known and made clear, then likewise, not everyone who ascribes to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is actually upon <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, and their opposition and departure can be investigated, known and made clear.</b> The fact that <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> did not venture into defining what <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is through the statements of those Salafi Scholars just mentioned shows that he is academically dishonest, and that he has an agenda to pursue, in which Western academic and Orientalist perceptions are of more value (in defining Salafiyyah) than the statements of Salafi scholars, whether past or contemporary.    <P>
Shaikh Salih al-Fawzaan was asked (in the lecture, "at-Tahdheer min al-Bid'ah" second cassette, delivered as a lecture in Hawtah Sadeer, 1416H) , "<u>Is <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> a hizb (party) from amongst the parties. And is ascribing to them (i.e. the Salafis) a blameworthy thing?</u>" To which he replied:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>As-Salafiyyah is the Saved Sect, and they are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah</b>. <u>It is not a hizb (party) from amongst the various parties, those which are called "parties" today</u>. Rather they are the Jamaa'ah, the Jamaa'ah upon the Sunnah and upon the Deen (religion). They are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah. The Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said, "<i>There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah manifest and upon the truth not being harmed by those who forsake them neither by those who oppose them</i>" and he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) also said, "<i>And this Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the <a href='tags/hellfire.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hellfire</font></a> but one</i>". They said, which one is this O Messenger of Allaah? He replied, "<i>They are those who are upon what I and my companions are upon today</i>". <b>Hence <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is a group of people upon the madhhab of the Salaf, upon what the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) and his companions were upon and it is not a hizb from amongst the contemporary groups present today</b>. Rather it is the very old Jamaa'ah, from the time of the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) which inherits (this way) and continues, and which never ceases to be upon the manifest truth until the establishment of the Hour, as he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) has informed (us)." </blockquote>    <P>
Imaam al-Albaani (rahimahullaah), in response to the question:    <P>
<blockquote><div class='arabic' align='right' lang='AR-SA'>&#1604;&#1605;&#1575;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1587;&#1605;&#1610; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1567; &#1571;&#1607;&#1610; &#1583;&#1593;&#1608;&#1577; &#1581;&#1586;&#1576;&#1610;&#1577; &#1571;&#1605; &#1591;&#1575;&#1574;&#1601;&#1610;&#1577; &#1571;&#1608; &#1605;&#1584;&#1607;&#1576;&#1610;&#1577; &#1567; &#1571;&#1605; &#1607;&#1610; &#1601;&#1585;&#1602;&#1577; &#1580;&#1583;&#1610;&#1583;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;&#1567;</div></blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>Why the label of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>? Is this a partisan call or a doctrinal one? Or is it a new sect in Islaam?</blockquote>    <P>
He replied, as documented in <i>al-Tuhfah al-Mahdiyah Liman Sa'ala an Ma'naa al-Salafiyyah</i> (p. 34), cited from al-Asaalah, (Volume 9, pp. 86-90):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>Indeed, the word 'al-Salaf' is known in the language of the Arabs and in the language of the [Divine] Shar' (legislation), and what concerns us here is to investigate it from the legislative aspect:    <P>
For it is authentically related from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that during the illness (preceding) his <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> he said to Sayyidah Faatimah (radiallaahu anhaa), "<i>So <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> Allaah and have <a href='tags/patience.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>patience</font></a> for an excellent 'salaf' I am for you</i>." And the Scholars' usage of the word 'al-Salaf' is abundant, and it is more abundant than can be enumerated. But sufficient for us is a single example, and it is what they use in combatting <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> (bid'ah):    <P>
<div align=center><i>And every good is in following the Salaf and every evil is in the <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> of the later ones (or those who turned away).</i></div>    <P>
There is however, from those who claim <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a>, who rejects this ascription claiming that it has not basis! So he says, "It is not permissible for a Muslim to say, 'I am Salafi'," and it is as if he is saying, "It is not permissible for a Muslim to say: I am a follower of the Righteous Salaf in what they were upon of <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a>, worship and behaviour."    <P>
<b>No doubt the likes of this rejection - if he was intending it - would make it binding upon him to free himself from the authentic Islaam which our Righteous Salaf used to be upon, and at the head of them, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</b>, just as is indicated by the mutawaatir hadaeeth which is in the two Saheehs (of al-Bukhari and Muslim) and others, from [the Prophet] (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "<i>The best of generations is my generation. Then those who follow them. Then those who follow them</i>." Hence, it is not permissible for a Muslim to free himself from ascribing to the Righteous Salaf. On the other hand, if he was to free himself from any other ascription, it would not be possible for any of the people of <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> to ascribe disbelief and sin to him. But the one who rejects this ascription (to the Salaf), do you see that he does not ascribe to any particular school from amongst the schools?! Irrespective of whether this school is connected to <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> or to jurisprudence?    <P>
For he will either be an Ash'aree or Maatureedee (in creed), or he may be from <a href='tags/ahl-al-hadeeth.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahl al-Hadeeth</font></a> (in jurisprudence) or a Hanafi, Shaafi'ee, Maalikee or Hanbali from those (schools of jurisprudence) that enter into the meaning of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah [i.e. because they do not oppose the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah even if they have different approaches in jurisprudence]. And alongside this, the one who ascribes to the Ash'aree madhhab or (any) of the four schools (of jurisprudence), then he undoubtedly ascribes to individuals who are not infallible (free of making mistakes), even if there are scholars amongst them who arrive at the truth (in matters), <b>so I wish I knew why he does not reject the likes of these ascriptions to individuals who are not infallible?</b>    <P>
But as for the one who ascribes to the Righteous Salaf, then he ascribes to that which is infallible - <u>in a generalized sense</u> - and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) mentioned that from the signs of the Saved Sect (al-Firqah al-Najiyah) is that it holds fast to what the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and his Companions were upon.     <P>
<b>So whoever held fast to it, out of certainty, then he is upon guidance from his Lord and there is no doubt that the clear, manifest, distinguishing, plain appellation (title) is that we say, "<i>I am a Muslim upon the Book and the Sunnah upon the methodology of our Righteous Salaf</i>" and this is said concisely as "<i>I am a Salafi</i></b>."</blockquote>    <P>
Yasir Qadhi is not honest enough to allow <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> to be defined through Salafi Scholars and Imams themselves, and instead  follows the approach of the Jewish and Christian Orientalists who impose their fake, rubber, elastic definition of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> which helps serve their academic and political interests. That's why we do not see statements about <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-al-qayyim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn al-Qayyim</font></a>, the scholars of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a>, Ibn Baz, al-Fawzaan and a multitude of other scholars both past and contemporary. There is only one <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and its the one defined by Salafi Scholars through the types of texts mentioned in the quote above.     <P>

In contrast to the above, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is upon the manhaj of <b><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a></b> (open up arms to Shia's, Sufis and everyone else) and <b><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b> (a new civic Islam). He is not bringing anything new in reality, however, his presentation of the same essential ideas are done in a more sophisticated way, and in his approach to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and Salafis, he follows the way of Jewish, Christian Orientalists who treat <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> as a modern movement and he cowardly flees from citing statements of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, <a href='tags/ibn-al-qayyim.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn al-Qayyim</font></a>, Ibn Baz, al-Fawzan which justice would have demanded from him.     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Notes on the Above</font>    <P>
On page 11 of his article, Qadhi writes in his footnote, "<i>Had Ibn Taymiyya been alive today, he would not have written the works that he did; rather, he would have paid attention to the intellectual threats the Ummah is currently facing. Ibn Taymiyya wrote in response to the challenges of his day; modern Salaf&#299;s are, for the most part, unwilling to venture outside of the territories and ideas that Ibn Taymiyya wrote about seven hundred years ago and face the challenges of our day</i>." The following points will demonstrate that this is fanciful thinking:    <P>
<b>01.</b> Ibn Taymiyyah's da'wah was based around reconnecting the Ummah to <b>the Salafi way</b> after the ummah had been severed from the Righteous Salaf due to historical, social and political factors and to refute every faction who had swerved from the way of the Salaf. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> considered the Salafi way to be nothing but the truth and which the Ummah must return to in order to attain the desired unity and repel the differing that caused the splitting of the Ummah. He said in refutation of the Ash'ari Jurist, al-Izz bin Abd al-Salaam (<a href=../salafis.com/index112b.html?emndqhc>see here</a>), "<i>There is no fault (blame) upon the one who proclaims the madhhab of the Salaf, who ascribes to it and affiliates himself to it. Rather, it is obligatory to accept that from him by unanimous agreement, for the madhhab of the Salaf is never but the truth</i>." (Majmu al-Fatawa 4/149). Had <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> been alive today, he would have embarked upon exactly the same, to reconnect the Ummah to the way of the Salaf, arguing for it, defending it, and refuting every opposer to that way. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> would have clarified that deviation away from <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a>, the Sunnah and the Salafi path is <b>the fundamental cause</b> for the problems and challenges facing the Muslim Ummah - as is evident through his writings. Had he been present today, a large and significant part of his methodology would have been to refute all modern groups who swerve and deviate from the way of the Salaf, thereby increasing the <a href='tags/disease.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>disease</font></a> and weakness of the Ummah, and make clear that their way is other than the way of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> in which all success and rectification lies. Al-Haafidh al-Bazzaar (d. 749H), a student of <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, stated (refer to <i>al-Qawl al-Jali Fee Tarjamat Shaykh al-Islam Taqi al-Din <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> al-Hanbali</i>, Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, pp.582-583):     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>He wrote a great deal in the (field of) usool [meaning matters of creed], let alone in other sciences, so I asked him for the reason behind that and I requested from him to author a text in fiqh in which he compiles together his preferred views and the stronger opinions so that it could be relied upon in giving fatwa, so he said to me with what means: "The affair of the furoo' (branches, rulings) is an easy one, when a Muslim follows one of the blind-following scholars (of one of the madhhabs), it is permissible for him to act upon his saying, so long as he has not become certain of the error of his saying. But as for the usool (foundations), then I have seen the people of <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a> and misguidance and desires such as the <a href='tags/mutafalsifah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/mutafalsifah-de.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Mutafalsifah</font></a></font></a> ("Islamic" philosophers), the Baatinyyah, the Malaahidah, those speaking with the Unity of Existence, the Dahriyyah (Materialists, Atheists), the Qadariyyah, the <a href='tags/nusayriyyah-kg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/nusayriyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Nusayriyyah</font></a></font></a>, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Hulooliyyah, the Mu'attilah, the Mujassimah, the Mushabbihah, the Raawandiyyah (a Sufi sect), the Kullaabiyyah, and the Salimiyyah and other than them from the people of <a href='tags/innovation.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovation</font></a>, they deeply engrossed themselves in them (the innovations), with misguidance reaching critical levels, and it became clear to me that  many of them intended to invalidate the sanctified Muhammadan Shari'ah, that is superior and lofty over every deen, and that all of them as as whole threw the people into doubt about the usool of their deen. And for this reason, rarely did I hear or see one who turned away from the Book or the Sunnah, turning towards their sayings except that he became a heretic or he became uncertain in his religion and belief. So when I saw the affair was like this, it became clear to me that it is obligatory upon everyone who is able to repel their doubts and their falsehood and to cut off their proofs and their misguidances, that he should expend his efforts to expose their evils, their counterfeit evidences, in order to defend the upright religion, and the authentic, lofty Sunnah." </blockquote>    <P>

His intent was to warn the Ummah about issues that will lead them to misguidance and whose misguidance and danger most people may not realize. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> in no way took the futile path being advocated by <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> of leaving aside "<i>complex and intricate issues of theology</i>", rather he addressed those issues for the reason that he explained and he included amongst those whom he refuted, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a>, the Kullaabiyyah and their likes from the Ash'aris and all other factions of opposers and <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>innovators</font></a>.     <P>

<b>Note:</b> <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, in this quote here, may just well be referring to the way of those "<b>Madkhalis</b>" that <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> takes pleasure in denigrating in his article by accusing them of intellectual backwardness and inferiority. The label of "Madkhalis" is used tactfully by the detractors because it helps to perpetuate confusion and makes it appear that the Salafis who adhere to that methodology are just <u>an extreme fringe</u> of a modern movement creating fitnah in the ummah. When in reality, they are upon the Prophetic Salafi way of removing the fitnah brought into the Ummah by those who left the Prophetic Salafi way they were commanded to follow by Allaah, the Mighty Majestic, and by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) himself, and instead, using their opinions, thoughts and understandings, they innovated and split the Ummah and caused it to become diseased, inviting <a href='tags/calamities.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>calamities</font></a> and tribulations.    <P>
The above quote from <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> is alongside our <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> that <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> did not leave a faction from those factions who deviated from the "Prophetic Salafi way" in belief, speech or action, except that he refuted them and dedicated himself to writing about them in one form or another and to one degree or another. <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> was a Salafi. He called to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. He championed the way of the Salaf. And he reconnected the Ummah back to the Salaf. Had he been alive today, he would have done exactly the same and would have written and stated explicity, "Rectification lies in the way of Salafiyyah" and this is found throughout his writings, when he refuted the <a href='tags/raafidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/raafidah-ky.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/raafidah-zm.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Raafidah</font></a></font></a></font></a>, the Sufiyyah, the <a href='tags/jahmiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jahmiyyah</font></a> and all other factions or individuals. As for the misconception <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> brings, that there are challenges we face today like Secularism and Hedonism and the likes, these are red-herrings, the majority of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> know of the inherent falsehood of these affairs and rarely are they going to leave Islam through these routes. But what <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> really intends to say through these types of misconceptions is:    <P>
<blockquote><i>We are facing a new challenge - and what he means here is that we are living in democracies in the West, we are living where music is commonplace, films and movies are commonplace, we mix with all sorts of people (religions and Islamic sects) and there are many strong cultural, social and political influences - and so what we need is a new fiqh and a new approach. But in this regard, those Scholars of the desert are of no real use or benefit to us because they don't live in these lands, and all they will do is to tell us "<a href="tags/haraam.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">haraam</font></a>" or "<a href="tags/halaal.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">halaal</font></a>". So it is upon us to develop a new, modern scholarship for these lands so we can start accommodating much of what we consider to be the positive aspects in these democracies.<b> This is a new liberal, civil Islam</b>. The same one <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> is calling for in the Gulf countries - one which accommodates Sufis, Shi'ahs and others and focuses on tackling social, economic and political problems primarily, as a greater priority, and where <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> and Sunnah take a back seat and whose finer details (meaning points of contention between various factions) are spoken of academically in certain settings upon a mindset of al-Irjaa' where the academic elites from the various factions can have intellectual debates about theological issues and loyalty and disloyalty and love and hate are relegated to the dustbin. Thus, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> can, for example, have an academic debate with Ash'aris and Sufis, but that's pretty much going to remain as it is, with every party considered as being upon the truth and having a justified stance. Why? Because there is no such thing as <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> that is a criterion for the Ummah and through which it can be said about a belief, statement or action, "<i>This is truth</i>", "<i>this is falsehood</i>"  or about a person, group or faction, "<i>guided</i>", or "<i>misguided</i>." A large array of (conflicting) opinions can be accommodated. and considered part of a "broad Sunni Islam."</i></blockquote>    <P>
This is the new civic liberal Islam of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>.

This is the true and real agenda and since <b>the Prophetic Salafi way</b> stands in the face of this attempt, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> has embarked upon a revisionist agenda and aims to undermine certain texts such as the hadeeth of the 73 sects with innovated understandings, mixing truth with falsehood, so as to undermine <b>the Prophetic Salafi way</b>.

As for the claim of <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, that <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is not intellectually stimulating and cannot tackle modern-day problems (<a href=../salafis.com/index21ad.html?abzqejd>see article</a>), this is pure arrogance and a very grave and serious statement for which he needs to announce his tawbah openly and clearly.     <P>
