<font class='titleHeadline'>Between Yasir Qadhi's Shrewdness and Abu Eesa Niamatullah's Thuggish, Brutish Intellect</font>    <P>
<blockquote>There is a difference between <b><a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> (see   <a href=../salafis.com/index771b.html?ydtsjtx>this article in particular</a>, and also <a href=../salafis.com/indexad4e.html?fqyafwl>here</a>, <a href=../salafis.com/index0db3.html?hoofwxb>here</a>, <a href=../salafis.com/index16eb.html?kgjedzp>here</a>, and <a href=../salafis.com/index21ad.html?abzqejd>here</a>) and <b><a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a></b>. <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is smarter and shrewder in knowing how to play politics in the public da'wah scene in order to maintain (apparent) consistency. Abu Eesa Niamtullah is dumb and has with him a certain bruteness that strips him of any semblance of aql (intellect). You only need to prod him once and the "<i>pathological hatred</i>" he harbours (whilst accusing others of it) pours out like water out of a jug, and that which he accuses the Salafis of (of unjust rulings on people), pours out freely, without hindrance from his heart and soul with the ferociousness of a lion, yet the thought and intelligence of a domestic turkey (see the proof of that in <a href=../salafis.com/index545f.html?gutdibl>Part 3</a>). That's what has happened in short of a few days, and these are realities that <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> has revealed about himself in short of three pages worth of Facebook rants. This series of articles is an elaboration upon this reality, and whilst some may protest these descriptions we are using here, we are only describing what a man reveals of himself through his speech and action. <b>Further, what are these words of ours compared to what you are going to read from <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> in the articles to follow?</b> Yes, that's a question you should start asking now, so that you anticipate the shock before it comes. Go ahead, read <a href=../salafis.com/index545f.html?gutdibl>Part 3</a> and try telling us we haven't spoken the truth...    <P>
Back to our point, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> knows full well that making any type of claim of adherence to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> will expose his hypocrisy openly and plainly. He knows this is a tricky, thorny path. <b>This is because <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> has usool (foundations), it has lawaazim (binding necessities), it has outward manifestations by which a person's conduct can be evaluated to see if what he claims is in his heart and on his tongue is being manifested by his actions. This is why <u>true</u> <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is resented by these people, and this resentment of their's is unleashed upon those who value this <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> in belief, speech and deed and try their utmost to uphold it, to the best of their ability.</b>  Thus, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, having spent a considerable stretch at the University of Madinah, knows only too well that in pursuing the (Ikhwani) agenda that he and his likes have devised for the West (propping themselves up as future leaders and scholars for the Ummah), it is fatal to ascribe to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and to the Salafi Shaykhs whilst pursuing this agenda. Because as soon as you ascribe to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and claim to be Salafi, then automatically you subject yourself to evaluation, scrutiny and your <u>words</u>, <u>deeds</u>, <u>actions</u>, <u>da'wah</u>, <u>methodology</u> and <u>allegiances</u> can be compared to a criterion and if you are a liar in your claim you will not escape being convicted, <b>not even from the speech of the likes Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad or Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen</b>, let alone the rest of the Salafi scholars of today.      <P>
On the other hand those displaying <u>the brutishness of thugs</u> and <u>the intellects of beasts</u> like <b><a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a></b> (see <a href=../salafis.com/index545f.html?gutdibl>Part 3</a>), they are not able to think that far ahead and as a result set themselves up for being exposed for their blatant hypocrisy, alongside their ignorance, oppression and injustice. When he took the opportunity to use what is happening in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> to make his brutish, slanderous outburst against those holding to the creed and methodology of the Salaf, he made the claim of being upon the way of the Salaf for the past 20 years. Here he subjected himself to an evaluation of his claim, something <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> knows is something to be avoided. <img src=../salafis.com/assets/images/abueesa-yaqadhi-fb.gif align=right style="margin:6px 0px 2px 15px" border="1" align="right" border=0>That's why in a supporting message to <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> on the same day, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> advised him, "<i>Abu Eesa, leave their Salafiyya and join Orthodox Islam</i>." This is from Yasir Qadhi's shrewdness, he is advising him, as if to say, "Don't ascribe to their <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, just leave ascription to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> altogether and join Orthodox Islam instead" and as if to indicate to <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> that which he (Qadhi) has already grasped, understood and become wise to, <b>that ascribing to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> is a liability</b>.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>If we put together all the foundations (as in principles relating to da'wah and manhaj) which Imaam <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, <a href='tags/imaam-ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ibn Baz</font></a>, Imaam Ibn al-Uthaymeen, Shaykh al-Fawzaan, Shaykh al-Ghudayan, Shaykh al-Luhaydaan, Shaykh Rabee', Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhali, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee, Shaykh Salih al-Suhaymee, Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad, Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee and many others, and their positions against the various groups and parties - if we put all of together, <b>we will find perfect agreement between all these Scholars in <u>the foundational principles</u> at least that in turn would provide a solid basis <u>to evaluate the speech and action</u> of people like <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> and Abu Eesa Niamatullah</b>. Yes, there may be isolated statements made by some of these scholars for certain reasons or due to specific (historical) circumstances, however, in a broad general sense, there is such agreement between all of these Scholars in the principles, that this collective agreement <u>in a common denominator</u> would be sufficient to judge the claim of anyone who claims to be Salafi in his creed, methodology and da'wah and to render him a liar in his claim. Take for example the advice of Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad or Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen in issues pertaining to rulership, <a href='tags/rebellion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rebellion</font></a>, demonstrations, protests and the likes (and many other issues too). Do those scholars consider this matter to be an asl (foundation) from the usool of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. Yes they do. So does the speech of <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> or <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> follow on from their speech? Certainly not. However, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> preserves himself by expelling himself from <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> (because he has acquired such a following that reference to those scholars is not needed anymore) so the advices of those scholars are not binding upon him as they are not <i>intellectually stimulating</i> enough for him. But on the other hand Abu Eesa's hypocrisy becomes plainly clear in that although he ascribes to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, the Scholars whom he should be referring to in such grave and serious matters are in one valley, and he is on a different planet. So you get the point here, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is shrewd in his misguidance. Abu Eesa, not so. And that's the difference between carefully planning and crafting your writings and positions as <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> does and coming down like down a brutish thug, devoid of any intellectual content, as <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> has done in his Facebook rants, which we shall be evaluating. </div>     <P>
So lets elaborate upon the point made in this article, and lets expose the lies, hypocrisy, oppression and injustice coming from <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> against those holding onto and venerating the creed, methodology and foundations of the Salafi da'wah. Lets compare the claim of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> by <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a> with what we know from the Imaams and Shaykhs of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> of our times, Imaam <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, <a href='tags/imaam-ibn-baz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Imaam Ibn Baz</font></a>, Imaam Ibn Uthaymeen, Shaykh al-Fawzaan, Shayk al-Ghudayaan, Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee, Shaykh Abd al-Azeez Aal al-Shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmee and many others, and lets see the truthfulness of his claims. To follow in next article inshaa'Allaah.    <P>
