<font style='font-size:15px;line-height:21px;'>  To <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a>, <i>as salaamu alaykum</i>:    <P>
I remind you with the speech of Allaah, the Exalted, "<b>He does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]</b>" (50:18) and the saying of Allaah, the Exalted "... <b>and shun false witness</b>" (22:30) and the saying of Allaah, the Exalted, "<b>O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> Allaah. Verily, Allaah is all-acquainted with what you do</b>" (5:8) and the saying of Allaah, the Exalted, "<b>Woe be to every slanderer and backbiter</b>" (104:1) and what is similar to this in the speech of Allaah, the Exalted. And also with what the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, <i>"Verily a man utters a word not seeing where it is going to reach (its outcome) and on account of it he falls into the Fire for seventy autumns</i>." (<i>Silsilah al-Saheehah</i> of <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a> 2/78) and he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "<i>Whoever said about a believer that which is not with him, Allaah will make him reside in the puss of the people of <a href='tags/hellfire.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hellfire</font></a> until he renounces what he said.</i>" (Sahih al-Jaami' of <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a> no. 6196) and what is similar to this in the Prophetic Sunnah.    <P>
On the 28th August you wrote an article on Facebook (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/abueesa-attack-fb.gif>screenshot</a>) in which you slandered thousands upon thousands who ascribe to and follow the Salafi <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and methodology. You spoke of them with language that is like the language of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in dealing with the Hypocrites, and you took opportunity from what is happening in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> to speak of them in this manner.     <P>
<b>Those thousands upon thousands will be your disputants on the Day of Judgement in front of Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted.</b>     <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>As it relates to Egypt:</font>    <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> except their belief that the  Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) does not speak of his own desire but by revelation sent down to him, and their belief that the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) left no good or evil, harm or benefit except that he informed his Ummah of it, and their belief that from the greatest of affairs of <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> which Allaah revealed to him is the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> of the splitting and tribulations in this ummah, and their belief that from this <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> is knowing how to behave in such times of tribulation, and their belief that this includes the issue of <u>evil, tyrannical, oppressive, unjust rulers</u>, and their belief that when the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) ordered with hearing and obedience to such <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>, he did so after describing them with <u>a)</u> not following his guidance, <u>b)</u> not following his Sunnah, <u>c)</u> having hearts of devils in bodies of men, <u>d)</u> beating the people and e) confiscating their wealth, and their belief that such a legislative command is not one that can be originated by the intellects of men, but it is pure far-reaching wisdom and mercy coming from the Lord of all men, whose <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> encompasses all matters, and in which there is safety, preservation of life, and the prevention of greater tribulation...     <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> except that they believe the command of the Messenger (sallallalahu alayhi wasallam), his speech and guidance is <u>far superior</u> to the opinions and ramblings of <i>haughty, arrogant people</i> like yourself (and <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, and Waleed Basyouni)... those who use the terms "<i>political aspiration</i>", "<i>political science</i>" and what is like that in order to invalidate the Prophetic Sunnah (the ahadeeth of fitan) in the same way the Ash'arites use their kalaam to invalidate the Prophetic Sunnah (the ahaadeeth of the sifaat).    <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> except that they have taken the ahaadeeth of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan, Adiyy bin Haatim, Waa'il bin Hujr, Anas bin Malik, Abu Hurairah, Ibn Mas'ood, Ubaadah bin al-Saamit and dozens of others (radiallaahu anhum) who have narrated from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) on the evil <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> to come, their <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a>, their <i>atharah</i> (demanding their own rights whilst not fulfilling those of subjects) - that they have taken such ahaadeeth with acceptance and pleasure and know it is the truth from their Lord because of their certainty that there is no legislation and command superior to the legislation and command of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)  whether the intellects grasp it or not and whether the desires and tastes resign to it or not...    <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> except that those Salafis supported and  propagated the verdicts of the Imaams of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> in our time (those whom you make a false claim of following), <b><a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a></b>, <b>Bin Baz</b> (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-binbaz.jpg>fatwa</a>) (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-binbaz2.jpg>fatwa</a>), <b>Ibn al-Uthaymeen</b> (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-uthaymin.jpg>fatwa</a>), <b>al-Fawzan</b> (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-fawzan.jpg>fatwa</a>) (<a href=http://ikhwanis.com/?zowfjuf>fatwa</a>), <b>Aal al-Shaykh</b> (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-aalshaykh.jpg>fatwa</a>), <b>al-Ghudayaan</b>, <b>al-Najmee</b>, <b>al-Luhaydaan</b>,  <b>al-Raajihee</b> (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/sunpub-demonst-raajihee.jpg>fatwa</a>) (and so on) which prohibit rallies and demonstrations in observance of that great and mighty Prophetic command (in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah and others), advice in which there is the <i>hikmah</i> and <i>aql</i> that the Salafis recognize and whose intended benefit they desire for the Egyptian people (and others before them), which is the preservation of Muslim life and the prevention of widespread tribulation - <b>and by Allaah, they have been vindicated and proven right against liars, slanderers and calumniators such as yourself</b>. The zakaa (&#1586;&#1603;&#1575;&#1569;) of their hearts in venerating and obeying the command of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)  has proven that their intellects are far superior to the alleged (&#1584;&#1603;&#1575;&#1569;) you people pretend to have.     <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> except that those Salafis to whom you show pathological hatred actually grasp and fathom that great and mighty statement of Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1610;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;: &#1587;&#1578;&#1608;&#1606; &#1587;&#1606;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1573;&#1605;&#1575;&#1605; &#1580;&#1575;&#1574;&#1585; &#1571;&#1589;&#1604;&#1581; &#1605;&#1606; &#1604;&#1610;&#1604;&#1577; &#1608;&#1575;&#1581;&#1583;&#1577; &#1576;&#1604;&#1575; &#1587;&#1604;&#1591;&#1575;&#1606;. &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1580;&#1585;&#1576;&#1577; &#1578;&#1576;&#1610;&#1606; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603;</span>):     <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'><b>Rather, <u>the intelligent people</u> have said, "Sixty years of a tyrannical ruler is better than a single night without a ruler."

Presence of a certain amount of law and order in a society in the presence of <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> and oppression from the ruler, even if lasts decades, is far better than a night, week or month of chaos and meltdown which leads to difficulty in movement of people, goods and <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> as well as loss of life,<b> rather such loss of life in a single night, a week or a month, that has perhaps never been lost in decades upon decades of the rule of an oppressive ruler</b>. No doubt what we find in the Sunnah as it relates to the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> has these beneficial interests in mind, and on this basis the Salafis (whom you slandered) venerate the command of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), they actually value Muslim life.     <P>
<b><u>Is it for no other reason</u></b> but this that you slandered, reviled and mocked those thousands and thousands of Salafis, took their honour, tore open their hearts and denied them even an ounce of sincerity, and you described them as "<i>ten times more ignorant</i>" than the most ignorant of the ignorant from  "<i>the villages in the peind back home</i>" - as is explicit in your oppressive, criminal Facebook articles?  And yet Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> judges that which the Salafis have said as the saying of "the intelligent people!"    <P>
You tore open the hearts of thousand of those Salafis and invalidated their sincerity in wishing, rather, craving and desiring with an intense desire for the safety and security of the people of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, so that the evil that has now transpired - (through the innovated, Marxist, Communist, Socialist demonstrations and rallies promoted, defended or justified by haughty, arrogant people like yourself, <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> and Waleed Basyouni) - would not have transpired:    <P>

Those thousands upon thousands of Salafis whose hearts desired and craved with an intense craving and desire for the protection of the lives of these people who have been needlessly killed, and whose hearts had intense concern for the families and children who have been instilled with <a href='tags/fear.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>fear</font></a> and who suffer lack of <a href='tags/food.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>food</font></a> (greater and worse than before), they will dispute with you on the Day of Judgement and challenge your speech of them, characterizing them as if they are the Hypocrites whose traits are described in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>. Alongside the <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> that those thousands upon thousands were simply  venerating and following the Sunnah of their Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and warning from <u>the dark, gloomy, ignorant, misguided opinions</u> of those who oppose the Sunnah with their equally <u>dark and gloomy intellects</u> (<i>uqool</i>) which lead to amplified <u>dark and gloomy results</u> like those indicated above.    <P>
Further, your likes will have to account for the slander against the thousands upon thousands of Salafis that they support the violence and killing against the Egyptian people. Your likes will have to explain why you have scapegoated those Salafis for the crimes being committed against the Egyptian people, when all of that tribulation comes back upon the shoulders of astray politicians like you who  speak as if your opinions are better guided and more beneficial for the Egyptian people than the advice of the light of revelation spoken by Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). <b>Whilst those thousands of Salafis lament over the tribulations brought about upon the people of <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> on account of the views and opinions of haughty arrogant people like you and your friends, you oppressively and criminally scapegoat them, as if they are the ones who are responsible for the bloodshed and killing!</b> And you goad and rile up your audiences, leading them to believe that every calamity is at the feet of the Salafis!    <P>
In that same first article of 28th August, you described them as "<i>a psychotic extremist ignorant cult</i>." You described them as "<i>flies</i>" feasting on the "<i>dead necrotic body</i>" of the Ummah, "<i>rejoicing therein</i>." By Allaah what slander and calumny! There is no greater language of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> and ascribing the hypocrisy of disbelief than the likes of this language. <b>All of those thousands upon thousands will dispute with you in front of Allaah on the Day of Judgement for negating and invalidating their eemaan with such oppressive statements.</b> You described them as "<i>whacky loony tune brothers and sisters</i>" and you oppressively and criminally made them equal (in misguidance) to the Sufis who have their innovated <a href='tags/dhikr.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>dhikr</font></a> sessions, and those Sufis who believe the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) is made of light, and knows everything, and that the graves should be visited to solicit favours from the dead. This is yet further language indicating that you speak of them in terms of actions of kufr. <b>Those thousands upon thousands will be your disputants on the Day of Judgement. </b> Then in your post on Twitter on 31st August 2013 (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/abueesa-tweet-fb.gif>screenshot</a>), you made light of the speech of Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted in that you took the sayings of Allaah, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1608; &#1603;&#1585;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1575;&#1601;&#1585;&#1608;&#1606;</span>) and (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1608; &#1603;&#1585;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1580;&#1585;&#1605;&#1608;&#1606;</span>) and  (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1608; &#1603;&#1585;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1588;&#1585;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606;</span>) which occur in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> in relation to Allaah perfecting his light even though the disbelievers may detest it (9:32, 61:8), Allaah making his deen uppermost even though the pagans may detest it (9:33, 61:9), Allaah vindicating the truth by His speech even though the criminals may detest it (10:82), Allaah commanding to invoke Him alone, even if the disbelievers may detest it (40:14) - you took this speech of Allaah, the Exalted (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1608;&#1604;&#1608; &#1603;&#1585;&#1607;</span>), which relates to the pagans, disbelievers and you used it to enter those whom you refer to as "<i>pseudo-salafiyoooooon</i>" (intending it to rhyme with those verses), in the place of those whom Allaah refers to as <b>kaafiroon</b>, <b>mushrikoon</b> and <b>mujrimoon</b>, only to spite them for your love of Maturidi <a href='tags/deobandis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Deobandis</font></a>. Are Allaah's words or parts thereof to be used for the likes of this? Those thousands upon thousands will complain of your criminal oppression to Allaah, the moment they learn this is how they have been spoken about by the pen (fingers) of <a href='tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</font></a>.    <P>
Then on the 2nd September 2013 you posted a second article (<a href=../salafis.com/assets/images/abueesa-attack-fb-2.gif>screenshot</a>) in which you added mighty burdens upon burdens on top of your already existing burden, and you described with the following, unjust, excessive, criminal words, "<i>they are from the most deviant of all the Muslim groups. Think of all the extreme misguided groups offered amongst the S&#363;fis and Sh&#299;'ah and what not. Well this is the Salafi offering</i>" and "<i>they are from the most dangerous of Muslims</i>" and "<i>they are by far the most ignorant Muslim group you will ever come across.  Think of what you've heard from back in the peind from some village <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and their level of Deeni 'ilm. These "Salafiyyoon" are ten times more ignorant</i>" and "<i>they are the most blindly-following cult-like of all the Muslims</i>" and "<i>Don't waste a single second with their teachings and educational efforts because firstly it's not education and secondly they are efforts to lead you astray, not efforts to want real khayr for you.</i>"  You tore open their hearts again and negated every last ounce of sincerity of purpose found with them in teaching and promulgating the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/tawhid-eu.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">tawhid</font></a></font></a> of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger and warning from whatever opposes them both. Hence, the meaning of this is that when one of them  sits and teaches <b>Usool al-Thalaathah</b> or <b>Kitab al-Tawheed</b> or <b>Aqidah al-Waasitiyyah</b> or <b>Qawaaa'id Fiqhiyyah</b> or <b>Umdat al-Ahkaam</b> and so on to the scores and scores of books that the Salafis teach, then you passed judgement upon them and their efforts, that this is "<i>not education</i>" and that these are "<i>efforts to lead you astray, not efforts to want real khayr for you</i>." And then you add to this extreme oppression, your mockery of them by likening them to the most ignorant of the ignorant amongst the villagers, only that you made them "<i>ten times more ignorant</i>" and by Allaah, they are free and innocent of what you accuse them with.    <P>
<b>All of this and more</b> ... and does the intelligent person need more than this to realize the gravity of your wicked deeds and to see the loftiness of the mountains of sin at the feet of which have placed yourself?    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Invitation to Tawbah</font>    <P>
In front of you is the prospect that everything I have said here is the voice of each and every single one of those thousands upon thousands whom you have oppressed,  whose honour you have taken, whom you have slandered and calumnied, whose hearts you tore open, and who are your disputants on the Day of Judgement.    <P>
First and foremost, for your own benefit, I ask you to announce your tawbah openly and in public with a proper legislative tawbah with its conditions, without hesitation and delay, without playing and fooling around, without any excuses or justifications, and without making the actions of the (ignorant and foolish) that ascribe to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> as an excuse to justify, deflect from or shield your own criminal oppression, since <u>these types of ignorant and foolish people</u> are found amongst <u>all factions</u>  <b>and by Allaah, what greater proof of this is there than the fact that you have proven yourself to be the greatest exemplification of this very point</b>! Alongside the fact that you are not a layman but one assumed to have <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a>. And secondly, apologize to those thousands upon thousands who are free and innocent of your slanders and calumnies before a day on which neither wealth nor offspring will benefit, except He who comes to Allaah with a sound heart.     <P>
