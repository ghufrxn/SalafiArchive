<blockquote>All praise is due to All&#257;h, the Lord of the Worlds and may the &#7779;al&#257;t and sal&#257;m be upon the Messenger, to proceed: In a recent interview (<a href=http://interfaithradio.org/Story_Details/Salafi_Muslims__Following_the_Ancestors_of_Islam>see here</a>) Y&#257;sir Q&#257;dhi claimed that Salafi Islam is not "<i>intellectually stimulating</i>" enough for his liking and that the "Salafi movement" (<a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>) is "<i>not capable of addressing modern issues</i>." In this series of short articles observations and comments are made regarding the implications of what Y&#257;sir Q&#257;dhi has expressed.    <P>
<b><u>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</u>: Sound intellect never opposes <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> (indicating that Yasir Qadhi's "intellectual stimulation" is from the shubuhaat (doubts) against the truth that are easily refuted. <a href=../salafis.com/index8456.html?rxmqzrv>Read article here</a>).</b>  </blockquote>     <P>

<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Meaning of Aql</font>    <P>
<blockquote>It appears that <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> and his followers operate upon an understanding of <i>aql</i> (reason, intellect) other than the one indicated and praised in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and understood by the Scholars of Islam and the Sunnah. The aql (reason, intellect) they understand is a Western academic understanding of intelligence and intellect, one that is similar to the understanding of eemaan (faith) with the Murij'ah (ma'rifah without action). It is precisely for this reason that we see <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> clashing (in his positioning and practical da'wah) with Prophetic statements on the basis of his aql (reason) and ra'i (opinion) - a matter to be illustrated lucidly in coming articles in this series inshaa'Allaah. But here we want to establish the correct understanding of aql so we have something to work with in what is to follow of our observations on Yasir Qadhi's comments.</blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Word 'Aql'</font>    <P>
<blockquote>Shaykh al-Islam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> discusses the meaning and application of the word aql (reason) in many of his works, from them "<i>Risalah Fil-Ruh wal-Aql</i>" and also "<i>Bughyat ul-Murtaad</i>" (a refutation of the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> and Sufis). Here we are going to summarize a discussion from page 250 onwards of <i>Bughyat ul-Murtad</i>, since our intent is not to be exhaustive but only to make quick, concise notes which are sufficient for a reasonable person (aaqil) to take on board with acceptance.    <P>
So the word is used and applied for the following four matters (all of which collectively indicate what aql is):    <P>
<ul><li> [1] Reference to an instinctive, inherent quality in a person that allows him, her to understand and grasp matters, a faculty, similar to the ability of hearing through the ears, and seeing through the eyes.    <P>
<li> [2] Reference to basic, necessary knowledge agreed upon by all people of reason (aql), such as the knowledge that two is greater than one, and the whole is greater than its parts and so on.     <P>
<li> [3] Reference to investigative knowledge involving <u>a)</u> observation and inference or deduction or <u>b)</u> practical experience    <P>
<li> [4] Reference to actions that are necessitated by knowledge, as indicated by the saying of Allaah in Surah al-Mulk, "<b>And they will say: "Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!</b>" (67:10).   </ul>    <P>
And in the <i>Risalah Fil-Ruh wal-Aql</i> (p. 32), <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> says, under the chapter heading (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605; &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1587;&#1605;&#1609; &#1593;&#1602;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), "<i>Knowledge is not called 'reason' (aql)</i>":    <P>
<blockquote>And when [the affair is] like this [after citing verses from the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> related to reason (aql)], then knowledge (ilm) that is not acted upon by the one possessing it is not the meaning referred to by (the term) '<i>aql</i>', and nor (does it refer to) action without knowledge, <b>rather it refers to knowledge that is acted upon and acting upon knowledge</b>.</blockquote>    <P>
And <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> says in al-Majmoo' (16/36):    <P>
<blockquote>However, that which is praised is the beneficial knowledge whose possessor acts upon, for if the one possessing it does not act upon it, then he does not have aql (reason, intellect).</blockquote>    <P>
And Sufyan bin Uyainah (d. 198H) said (as relayed by Ibn Abi al-Dunya):    <P>
<blockquote>The one who knows good from evil is (not the one who is intelligent) but the intelligent is the one who knows good and follows it and knows evil and avoids it.</blockquote>  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Praiseworthy 'Aql' Intended in the Sharee'ah Texts</font>    <P>
<blockquote>  Putting the above altogether (and there are many other statements we have left for sake of brevity and concisenesse), we understand that aql (reason) is essentially:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Knowledge by which what is beneficial is distinguished from what is harmful and then acting upon the dictates of that knowledge, as in, what this knowledge necessitates of action, hence a person traverses those ways to attain what is beneficial and traverse those ways by which harm is avoided. Such a person is said to have the attribute of '<i>aql</i>' (reason)</b></blockquote>    <P>
And thus, without the fourth component [4], a person does not really possess aql (intellect). For this reason, in the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a>, Allaah rebukes those who have aql (upon the first three elements indicated above) but do not act upon what it requires of them (thereby, lacking the fourth), "<b>They have hearts wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones</b>." (7:179) and also, "<b>And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts, but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing</b>..." (46:26).    <P>
This indicates that possessing the elements of aql which are [1], [2] and [3] above do not cause one to possess actual aql, the aql which completes its meaning which is [4]. The important thing that we want to take from this is that mere knowledge, investigation, 'understandings' (fuhoom) and possession of investigative sciences and analytical power does not equate with aql (reason). And thus, the intellectual stimulation that <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is speaking of does not equate to the aql defined and praised in the texts of the Shari'ah, (<span class='arb' lang='AR-SA'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605; &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1587;&#1605;&#1609; &#1593;&#1602;&#1604;&#1575;</span>), as <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> indicated, "<i>Knowledge is not called 'reason' (aql)</i>." This is because <b>when we come to look at his speech on the Egyptian revolution</b> (<u>by way of example</u>) [<a href=../salafis.com/index0db3.html?hoofwxb>read all about it here</a>] we will see <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> opposing actual aql (reason) from all angles: From the angle of knowledge and from the angle of action, since making <i>tamyeez</i> (distinction) in knowledge-based matters between right and wrong and beneficial and harmful is the foundation - and <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> does not possess this <i>tamyeez</i> (or pretends not to have it) - and thereafter acting upon such correctly established knowledge to attain what is beneficial and repel what is harmful is what makes the entire thing to be 'aql' (reason) - and <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> either undermines that or calls to the opposite of that. This we shall investigate in the coming few articles inshaa'Allaah, it was necessary to allude to it here because without it, our intent would not be clear.</blockquote>    <P>

<b>The intent behind this quote will become clear in <a href=../salafis.com/index0db3.html?hoofwxb>the next article</a> in this series (inshaa'Allaah), when we demonstrate that aql (reason) is with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), and with the Companions (radiallaahu anhum) and that their speech regarding the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> and <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> is guidance, truth and light and that the ramblings of feeble-minded pseudo-intellectuals like <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> are darkness, misguidance and falsehood and that Shaykh al-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> <a href=../salafis.com/index8456.html?rxmqzrv>spoke the truth</a> when he said that sound reason and authentic text never oppose the way of Salafiyyaah. </b>    <P>
One should not be deluded by the fact that a person has attained degrees and doctorates and walks in prestigious university corridors and hallways and has a level of intellectual stimulation that he arrogantly considers to be above and beyond the rest of the people, and thus he is not stimulated by what stimulates them - even if it is the speech of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). The matter is as Shaykh ul-Islaam <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a> said about the <a href='tags/philosophers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Philosophers</font></a> who excelled in worldly sciences and showed great intelligence and perspicacity, "<i>They were given intelligence but were not granted purity (of heart) [in following, acting]</i>" and <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is a man who has something of this, and the evidences for this are manifest, plain and clear to the one who guides himself by the light of revelation and has been saved from the darkness of <i>kalaam</i>, <i>fikr</i> and <i>ra'i</i> - the world <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> entered into many years ago.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Of course we will see many of the followers and sympathizers of Qadhi take to the blogs and forums to vent their anger and frustration about these words, using vile and crude speech to denigrate those who speak with and call to the reason (aql) defined in the Sharee'ah. But we shall illustrate from Qadhi's own speech that he is challenging revealed text (wahy) with his own thought (fikr) and opinion (ra'i) and this will explain to us the reality of what <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> means when he speaks of "intellectual stimulation" not being found in <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, or to put it another way, not being found in  the clear texts of the <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the Sunnah which provide <u>methodological foundations</u> for the rectification of the servant and the land.</b></div>    <P>
The <u>intellectual stimulation</u> <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is speaking of then is mere <i>kalam</i> (blameworthy speculative speech), <i>fikr</i> (thought, ideology) and <i>ra'i</i> (opinion) in matters in which the legislation (sharee'ah) has already clarified in terms of knowledge  (ilm), action (amal), foundations (usool) and methodologies (manaahij). He does not see that the resolution to the world's problems, or to the problems faced by specific nations or communities can be addressed by "<a href="tags/salafiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Salafiyyah</font></a>" which he knows full well, <a href=../salafis.com/index39eb.html?nsphcpi>by definition</a>, is the pure Islam that the Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) preached and called to and which lays the foundations for true rectification of the servant and the land.  The reality of his position then is contradicting <b>wahy (revelation)</b> with independent reason (aql), fikr (thought) and ra'i (opinion). This we will highlight and illustrate, with examples, one by one inshaa'Allaah.     <P>
By keeping the definition of aql (reason) in mind, you will see how far <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> is from actual aql (reason) as correctly defined. So now lets draw upon <a href=../salafis.com/index0db3.html?hoofwxb>our first example</a> where <a href='tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a> sees more stimulation in <i>kalam</i>, <i>fikr</i> and <i>ra'i</i> than he does in the revealed texts, let us analyze one of his written pieces regarding the Egyptian <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a>.    <P>
