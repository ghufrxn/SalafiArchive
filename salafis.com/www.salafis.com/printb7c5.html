The Shaykh was asked:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>There is one who says that era of the Salaf was an era (a phase) that has come and gone.</blockquote>    <P>
His answer:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../salafis.com/images/quote-start.gif'>It is ended in relation to him, because he does not love the Salaf and nor does he desire to traverse upon their methodology. As for Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, then the era of the Salaf [as in what they were upon] will remain until the establishment of the Hour, he (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "There will not cease to be a group from my nation upon the truth. They will not be harmed by those who desert them or oppose them until the command of Allaah,  the Blessed and Exalted, arrives."</blockquote>    <P>
Refer also the the Shaykh's refutation of Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan al-Bootee wrote an entire book centred around this claim: <b>Is <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> Simply a Blessed Historical Time Period or Is It an Actual Jamaa'ah With a Distinct <a href='tags/creed.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>creed</font></a> and Methodology?</b> - (<a href=../salafis.com/index9576.html?oaxwjte>see here</a>)    <P>
