<p><div class='sidebar'><a href=dldfaa8.html?a=lghrdv><img src=assets/sysimages/adobe-pdf-icon.gif align=left border=0 border=0></a> The Difference Between the Marriages of King Richard II of England (d. 1400) to Six Year Old Isabella and King John (d. 1216)  of England to Twelve Year Old Isabella and The Pedophilia of Gary Glitter and Jimmy Saville</b>. This treatise is a response to those spiteful Isl&#257;m-haters who make the accusation of 'pedophilia' against the noble, revered Prophet of Isl&#257;m. This is a false, baseless accusation made only by three groups of people: The inquisitive truth seeker, the ignorant blind-follower devoid of rational faculties, or the hate-filled loon whose undergarments are on fire due to his seething hatred of Islam and Muslims. This 50 page treatise explores the matter and uncovers the realities. <b><a href=dldfaa8.html?a=lghrdv>Download PDF excerpt.</a></b> </div>    <P>
