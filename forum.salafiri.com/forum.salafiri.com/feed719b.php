<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Difference Between Blind Following A Scholar &amp; Seeking Aid From A Scholars Understanding</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muhammad Bin Ismaa’eel As-San’aanee</em><br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad bin Ismaa’eel As-San’aanee said, “And there is a difference between blindly following a scholar in everything that he says and seeking aid from his understanding.<br /><br />The first is adopting his statement without looking for a proof from the Quran or Sunnah.<br /><br />And seeking aid from his understanding- which is the second- is like the skillful guide on the path for the passer-by.<br /><br />So he (the scholar) is a guide to a proof, once he (the passer-by) reached it (the proof) he is sufficed from using other than it as a proof. And this is similar to he who uses the star to be guided to the Qiblah, if he sees the Qiblah; no reason is left to use the star”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ref: Irshaadun-Nuqaad elaa tayseeril-Ijtihaad 105</span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2017 3:48 pm</p><hr />
