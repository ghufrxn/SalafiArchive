				<h3>Sinning in Makkah is Worse than Anywhere Else</h3>

				<div class="content">And whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste a painful torment. [Hajj 22:25]<br /><br />Ibn al-Qayyim [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br />From the things that are exclusive to Makkah is that sinning within it is worse than anywhere else, even if one merely intended to do something bad. Allaah, the Most High, says:<br /><br />And whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste a painful torment. [Hajj 22:25]<br />Think about this Aayah, how the preposition ‘Ba’ has been connected to the word ‘Dhulm’ and He did not say, ‘whoever intends’ rather it has been connected to the verb, ‘Dhulm’ so the meaning changes to having the mere interest in doing a sin. So be warned, that even intending to a sin in Makkah can carry a great punishment. <br /><br />[Adapted from Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/51)]<br /><br />Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Ameen ash-Shinqeetee [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br />Some of the people of knowledge have stated that whoever does a sin in Makkah, then he will have a painful torment because of the magnitude the belongs to Makkah, even if one doesn’t end up doing the sin. This is the opposite of what one may do outside the Haram, as sins outside of the Haram don’t carry the same level of severity. <br /><br />It has been narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ood [May Allaah be Pleased with him] said, “If someone even intends to do a sin within the Haram then know that that the severe torment is applied to him.” This has been authentically narrated from Ibn Mas’ood.<br />Those who support this view from the scholars rely on the Aayah,<br /><br />And whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste a painful torment. [Hajj 22:25]<br /><br />It has been narrated in the Hadeeth that the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah eb Upon him] has stated that doing one sin will equate to one bad deed written against him [Narrated by Bukhaaree (6491) and Muslim (131)], however this Hadeeth doesn’t apply to Makkah as the Aayah above is more specific than the generality of the HAdeeth. [Adwaa al-Bayaan 4/294-295]<br />Shaykh Muhammad bin Saaleh al-‘Uthaymeen [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said, <br /><br />“This Hadeeth applies to everywhere except Makkah, as Makkah is an exception (based on the evidence from the Aayaah in Surah al-Hajj).” [Liqaa al-Maftooh]<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2016/08/sinning-in-makkah-is-worse-than.html?m=1">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2016/08/s ... n.html?m=1</a><!-- m --></div>
