<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">BIOGRAPHY OF SHEIKH-UL-HADITH MUFTI SHEIKH MUHAMMAD RAIS NADVI (رحمه الله)</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">LIFE AND WORKS</span></strong><br /><br />People come into this world for a specific time and then they depart, however there are some individuals whom Allah, the Most High, empowers to complete extraordinary and exceptional work. They illuminate and brighten knowledge and from their efforts, a sudden rapid change to the people of intelligence in the world becomes manifest. From amongst those people is one particular individual – my beloved Sheikh, Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) – who was an eminent researcher, teacher, author, debater, Sheikh-ul-Hadith &amp; Mufti of Jamia Salafia Banaras, India.<br /><br />He was well-known both as one of the most valuable scholars of this era as well as a devout and pious worshipper with excellent manners. He worked very hard in driving forward to promote and publish Tawheed in addition to eradicating Shirk and Bid’ah.<br /><br />He was fervent in addressing and clarifying the errors of the Deobandis. He exposed their cover-ups and unveiled the reality of their claims with proofs and evidences as bright as day. Without a shadow of a doubt, a lot of curtains (of doubt and deceit) have been lifted with his efforts and the exaggerated claims of people have been exposed. He consistently poured in an immense amount of hard work, sweat and effort in defending the way of the Muhaddith Imams and promoting the true Deen, I make Dua to Allah to make all his efforts to be beneficial and accepted. Ameen!<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">NAME AND LINEAGE</span></strong><br /><br />Mufti Rais Nadvi said, after verifying, ‘that my family ancestry is not written down and preserved because my grandfathers were not connected to education and learning. However, according to my grandfather, the family ancestry is like this: Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) son of Sakhawat Ali son of Muhammad Baqir son<br />of Jahangir son of Rajab Ali.<br /><br />The ancestry after this couldn’t be identified. Our family is called Ansari by which my companion and colleague Sheikh-Ul-Hadith Sheikh Safiur-Rahmãn Mubarakpuri (رحمه الله) author of ‘The sealed Nectar’ said is because of Islamic bonds, meaning one of our ancestors became Muslim through an Ansari Companion, just like how one of Imam Bukhari’s ancestors became Muslim through Yaman Ju’fi – so through this relation, he was called Yamani Ju’fi (attributed to him as accepting Islam under his hands.)<br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) said: ‘That I was named by my grandfather who passed away in 1952 at the age of 120 years old. He used to look after and help his grandfather and grandmother in accordance to the advice and guidance of his mother and because of this they loved him a lot. His grandparents used to help those who were religious, their relatives and the poor with money and other types of help.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>BIRTH</strong></span><br /><br />According to Muhammad Rais Nadvi’s (رحمه الله) statement he was born on the 7th of July 1937 in his home town of Batya, District of Murutiya Baaz, Utter Pradesh, India. The district was the first part of the district of Gur Kapoor and now this district has been split into three separate districts. In the time of the Shahidayn movement, a lot of people of knowledge dedicated them and attributed their names to this movement. The district’s Qari, Abdul Haq, and his father, grandfather and the Maulana of Mujwamir, Mir Ja’far etc. were widely regarded as mentors of this movement. My father travelled to Mujwamir during his studies and found out about the family of Mir Ja’far, however he also realised that no one from this village was Ahlul Hadith.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">STUDY AND UPBRINGING</span></strong><br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) said: ‘A few days before he was born, a school was established in our village with the efforts and struggles of Maulana Pir Ali. On this occasion, the organisers of a religious conference that took place had invited only Salafi scholars such as Maulana Abdur Ra’uf Khan Jandanagari, Maulana Abd at-Tawab Multani, Maulana Abdul Ghafar Rafiq and Maulana Muhammad Zaman Rahmani and other than them.<br /><br />He was just under five years old and his mother carefully and vigilantly encouraged him to perform the five daily prayers, the sheikh narrated to me (Sheikh Hafidh Zulfiker Ibrahim Memon Al’atharee (حفظه الله)) that he never missed a prayer since that day with the mercy of Allah.<br /><br />Additionally, she encouraged him to focus on studying at school where he lived in the village of his paternal family. He was also encouraged to study from his maternal grandfather. At that time, only two levels were taught in the two schools. Then he entered a primary school near the village and passed primary level. At that time all the teachers in the primary school were non-Muslim. The teachers of the school were Secretary Moeen-Ul-Haq, Secretary Abdul Majid and secretary Riza. He passed junior high school in Murutiya. During the winter time, when he was studying at primary and junior high school, he had to study either in the teacher’s house or in the school<br />building and they made a lot of effort to teach. After junior high school, he attended and passed a private high school called Madrasa Badariya in the district of Paka Bazar (which was an offshoot branch of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow). Here is where he learnt religious Arabic and Persian and then in 1958 he entered Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama Lucknow.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">FAMOUS TEACHERS</span></strong><br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) said that from the famous teachers he had were:<br /><br /> Maulana Sayid Abul Hasan Nadwi, from which he gained Ijazah in chains of hadith<br />that go through and reach <strong>Sheikh Ul-Kull Fil-Kull As-Sayyid Mian Nazeer Husain Ad- Dehalvi (رحمه الله) and Sheikh-Ul-Hadith Abdur-Rahmãn Mubarakpuri (رحمه الله)</strong><br /><br /> Maulana Abbas<br /><br /> Maulana Abdul Gafar Nadwi<br /><br /> Maulana Mahmud ul-Hasan Uthmani<br /><br /> Maulana Rabi’ Hasan Nadwi<br /><br /> Maulana Isbat<br /><br /> Maulana Mufti Zuhur<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>CLASSES AND TEACHING</strong></span><br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) said: ‘After he finished Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in 1960, he taught in Nadwa in accordance to the guidance and advice given by the director of Madrasa Badariya Paka Bazar, following this up with teaching at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, the teachers of the well-known scholar, Sayid Abul Hasan Nadwi. Then he taught in Jamia Siraj al-Uloom Jandanagar with the advice from Maulana Abul Hasan Nadwi. After that, again under the advice of Maulana, he taught in Darul Uloom Ahmadiya Salafiya, Darbang, Bihar and in 1969 became appointed to teach and lecture in Markaz Darul Uloom Jamia Salafiya.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">TEACHING QURAN AND HADITH</span></strong><br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) reported: In the years of when he was a student of knowledge, it was his privilege that Maulana Sayid Abdul Gafar Nadwi Nagrami went home in the year’s 3 months holiday. So in accordance with the command of the Maulana, I taught Quran lessons after Fajr prayer in the Jamia Masjid Paka Bazar (during these 3 months). This series of teaching continued in Jamia Siraj ul-Uloom, Jandanagar until people used to come from quite a few kilometers away to sit in my Quran lessons. Maulana Jandanagari himself sat in the classes and took notes. This continued in Darul Uloom Salafia, Darbang Alhamdulillah.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>LECTURES (SPEECHES, JUMU’AH KHUTBAS)</strong></span><br /><br />Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) said: Whilst he was in Jandanagar, he delivered Juma Khutbas (sermons). Even during his time as a student of knowledge, he would lead Juma prayer and deliver Juma Khutbas. However because of several heart attacks and an ongoing illness, upon advice from his therapists (doctors), he decided he would stop giving speeches and delivering Khutbas.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">BOOKS</span></strong><br /><br />In the final year of university at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, it was necessary to complete a dissertation thesis (research paper). Therefore Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) wrote a thesis entitled “<strong>the Jews in the Quran</strong>”. His teachers praised this work after seeing it. Maulana Ali Miya Nadwi advised him to write a book about the Jews and promised him to provide religious sources and books to assist this effort – to the extent that he handed over his personal book library Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله). So in his time as a student of knowledge, Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi (رحمه الله) wrote 4 volumes on this topic with a lot of effort, in addition to writing more than half of the 5th volume. <br /><br />This book consisted of almost 3,000 pages. However, unfortunately someone put their evil eye on this important book that Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi ( رحمه الله ) wrote and before it could become published, it was lost and went missing. Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rais Nadvi ( رحمه الله ) said that he didn’t have the ability to re-write the book because he became deprived of the benefits and companionship of Maulana Sayid Ali Nadwi.<br /><br />When he went to Jandanagar, Maulana Abdur Ra’uf told him to write a book in reply to a Barailwee innovator on the issue of the Messenger of Allah being omnipresent, so he wrote it and it is called “<strong>Tashih Aqaid Biabtal Shawahid Ash-Shahid</strong>”, which is published and available.
