<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Don’t Repeat Everything You Hear</span></span></strong><br />ash-Shaykh al-'Allãmah Sulaymãn ar-Ruhaylī<br /><br />This is a translation of an excerpt from a lecture giving by <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ash-Shaykh al-'Allãmah Sulaymãn ar-Ruhaylī</span></strong> may Allah preserve him.<br /><br />ash-Shaykh al-'Allãmah Sulaymãn ar-Ruhaylī mentions,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Don’t repeat everything you hear.</span></strong> Don’t repeat everything you hear. The veneration of Allah in your heart should be greater than the desire of oneself. O brothers, it’s imperative that we look into our speech before we speak. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Is this speech the truth</span></strong> and did we actually hear it? Because the youth today have become in reality from the greatest deceivers. [A person will say], “so and so said”, however if you ascertain to verify this, you’ll find that between him and the person are ten people. It’s important that the person actually heard this speech or he heard <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">via credible means</span></strong>. Then we must make sure that he understands the speech correctly because in these times, I say that there is almost no one who transmits word for word (precisely). Instead a person will hear speech, interpret it and then he will transmit. He will say, “Wallahi Sulaiman Ar-Ruhayli says such and such, in accordance to his understanding of the content of the speech however he doesn’t transmit the [exact] wording.<br /><br />The third point is that you must <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">fear Allah</span></strong> and contemplate on the effect this speech may have. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Is the effect of this speech good?</span></strong> Or is it evil? Does it aid the religion or its people? Is it considered to be spreading goodness? <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Or will this speech bring about evil?</span></strong> This plague is present and it is a lack of verifying information, a lack of correct understanding, and a lack of fearing Allah concerning the consequences of these statements, which has been the cause of much evil. How many people whom used to love one another have <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">separated due to the person either not verifying the information</span></strong> or either because he didn’t contemplate where this speech will lead to?! It is critical that we <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">pay attention</span></strong> to this. Allah writes everything we say against us. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Everything that we say is written against us</span></strong> so it is incumbent that we place between our ranks - in accordance to our ability- goodness that yields goodness. Also, looking into the outcome of speech is important. Few are those who have done this well. Few are those who have done this well. You may find he who verifies, he who understands (correctly) however <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">seldom you will find he who looks into the outcome and results of speech.</span></strong> What will occur as a result?<br /><br />My advice O brothers, is that we should refrain from this. We should reflect and contemplate over the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">fruits that speech bears</span></strong>. By Allah I know some of our brothers in al Madinah who were friends for twenty years upon the Sunnah, then a person will come and transmit speech from one friend to the next and as a result, the hearts separate. It’s appropriate that we look into and consider this.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF8000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Translated by Ismaeel Beaumont</span></span></strong><br />Al Madinah an-Nabawwiyyah<br />The Prophet’s City (ﷺ)<br />05th Rajab, 1436<br />Friday 24th April 2015<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Nov 21, 2016 9:43 pm</p><hr />
