<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Tafseer: Disobeying One Is Like Disobeying All</span></strong><br /><br />بسم الله والحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله ، وبعد<br /><br /><ul>* Opposing the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is like opposing the Sunnah of all the Prophets and Messengers before him.<br />* Disobeying one Messenger is like disobeying all the Messengers.<br />* Opposing one Messenger is like opposing all the Messengers.<br />* Disbelieving in one Messenger is like disbelieving in all the Messengers.</ul><br />Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴾</ul><br />{The people of Nooh belied the Messengers.} [Surah al-Shu`raa (26): 105]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Tafseer of al-Baghawee رحمه الله:</span></strong><br /><br />“It was said to al-Hasan al-Basree رحمه الله: O Abu Sa`eed! Don’t you see the statement of Allaah تعالى:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴾</ul><br />{The people of Nooh belied the Messengers.} [Surah al-Shu`raa (26): 105]<br /><br />And His تعالى saying:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴾</ul><br />{(The people of) `Aad denied the Messengers.} [Surah al-Shu`raa (26): 123]<br /><br />And also His تعالى saying:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴾</ul><br />{(The people of) Thamood denied the Messengers.} [Surah al-Shu`raa (26): 141]<br /><br />Whereas (each group of people) were sent with only one Messenger? He said: “The last one of them (i.e. Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) came with what the first one came with. So, if they deny any one of them, it is like denying all the Messengers.”<br />--end of quote<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Tafseer al-Muyassar:</span></strong><br /><br />“The people of Nooh عليه السلام disbelieved in the Message brought to them by their Prophet. By doing this, they disbelieved in all the Messengers. This is because every Messenger commanded (his people) to believe in all the Messengers.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Tafseer of Ibn Katheer رحمه الله:</span></strong><br /><br />“Here Allaah tells us about His servant and Messenger Nooh عليه السلام, who was the first Messenger, sent by Allaah to the people of earth after they started to worship idols. Allaah sent him to forbid that and to warn people of the consequences of idol worship. But his people belied him and continued their evil practice of worshipping idols besides Allaah. Allaah revealed that their disbelieving in him was akin to disbelieving in all the Messengers, So Allaah تعالى said:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ نُوحٌ أَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ ﴾</ul><br />{The people of Nooh belied the Messengers. When their brother Nooh said to them: &quot;Will you not have Taqwa?”}” [Surah al-Shu`raa (26): 105-106]<br />--end of quote<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Tafseer of al-Sa`dee رحمه الله:</span></strong><br /><br />“Allaah تعالى mentions the denial of the people of Nooh about their Messenger Nooh عليه السلام and what he said to them and what they replied back to him, and how their end was.<br /><br />He تعالى said:<br /><br /><ul>﴿كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ﴾</ul><br />{The people of Nooh belied the Messengers.} meaning: all of them. He نعالى made their denial of Nooh عليه السلام like denying all the Messengers. This is because, all of them, their call was one, their message was one. Denying (the Messengership of) anyone of them is akin to denying all of them.”<br />--end of quote<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Jul 30, 2017 1:25 am</p><hr />
