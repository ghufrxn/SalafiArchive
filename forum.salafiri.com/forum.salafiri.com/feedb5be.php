<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=199&amp;p=205#p205"><![CDATA[
All Praises are due for Allaah, the Lord of the creation. Ar-Rahmaan, ar-Raheem. Master of the Day of Judgement.<br /><br />I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allaah, having no partners, for Him is the Dominion, the Lord of Clear Truth.<br /><br />I bear witness that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger, the truthful and trustworthy one. May the Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him, his family, and all of his Companions.<br /><br />To proceed:<br /><br />Surely, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with its men, its resources and its establishments, have put forth an enormous effort in order to cater for the needs of the Pilgrims – those coming to preform Hajj, ‘Umrah and visiting of religious landmarks. For decades this country anticipates the season of Hajj with a generous budget and employment of increased manpower, an exertion that any country would be proud of. None of this can be belittled nor negated in the event of an accident caused by overcrowding, or the accidental pushing of some of the pilgrims or the decision of some of the pilgrims to violate governmental guidelines and instructions. <br /><br />It may be that such accidents occur, not due to the oversight of the authorities, rather it be that Allaah, the Most High, has Decreed that He has Chosen for some of His Slaves to be taken as martyrs, taken in the best possible situation – in a virtuous place, whilst others sustaining injuries in which they may be heavily rewarded in enduring.<br /><br />Based on all of this, blaming the authorities who have put forth such an endeavor and have exceeded in its accomplishments is not acceptable. All of this just leads to resentment and others boastfully claiming a supposed superior degree of skillfulness.<br /><br />The implications of such negativity include a negation of reward for those who have been afflicted. Rather those who busy themselves in criticizing, only criticize with a worldly objective or in order to take advantage of some political gain.<br /><br />The Kingdom - and all Praises are due to Allaah - is more than able to manage the annual Hajj, without any need for assistance. It has been blessed by Allaah with a sovereignty that is led by the Custodian of the Two Noble Masjids. Its constitution is founded with the objective of governing under a Devine directive. The produce of such foundations has effected and continues to affect the two Holy Masjids.<br /><br />For instance, Allaah has Surrounded His House and His Slaves with peace and serenity during times in which the world is experiencing an increase intensity of chaos and disruption and being burnt from the fire of tribulations and war.<br /><br />And all Praises are due to Allaah, the One Who has enabled the truthful ones from His Slaves to protect His Religion and His Sanctified City. And by them, the Muslims and the lands are in turn protected.<br /><br />أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا آمِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ ۚ أَفَبِالْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَكْفُرُونَ<br />“Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then do they believe in falsehood and become ingrate for the Graces of Allah?” [al-‘Ankaboot 29: 67]<br /><br />Likewise we thank Allaah for His Bounty upon us in enabling us to complete the Hajj, catering for hundreds and thousands of pilgrims. Surely, we are saddened by the accidents that occurred yesterday (10/12/1436 - 24/9/15), a Decree of Allaah that effected some of the pilgrims - an incident which caused an unfortunate stampede in Minaa; but with this, we do not say anything except that Pleases our Lord, without gaining His Anger or displeasure in His Decree.<br /><br />It is imperative that we investigate the causes so that such accidents do not reoccur. Those who were negligent must be immediately held to account, so that the efforts of the hundreds within the task force are not undermined. They are those who have given all in order to serve the Guests of ar-Rahmaan and have shown extreme kindness to the pilgrims, being with them in every step of the Hajj. They have made the pathways safe to cross, they navigated the crowds, treated the sick, given direction to the lost, gave religious guidance to the ignorant, fed the hungry, quenched the thirsty and been of serviced to the helpless. These are those who have been at the forefront of appeasing the desperation of the pilgrims, thus being deserved of recognition, commendation and our supplication and beseechment to Allaah, the Glorified and the Exalted, for them. Their hard work is not hidden and most of it is clear for the people to witness. So may Allaah reward them and multiply their recompense.<br /><br />From the corruption of the adversary is that they use accidents and tribulations that befall the people, in a chance and an opportunity to raise doubts. They use it as propaganda to belittle the hard efforts of others.<br /><br />The whole world is witness to the remarkable endeavors and the substantial budget set aside for the Hajj. The Guests of ar-Rahmaan have been welcomed with by the organizers and the general public alike.<br /><br />However, they behave in this manner because in the absence of shame, morals cease to exist and one is led to act however he pleases. From the bitterest forms of satire is that they use the pilgrims and martyrs as pawns to lament their objective. <br /><br />Meanwhile, their history is full of atrocities committed within the Haram! They bombarded the Haram in Makkah, killed its worshippers and used explosives within the Haram itself. Despite being a holy sanctuary, they brought within it weapons, casted horror into the hearts of the pilgrims, and even threatened to take their lives and possessions. All of this to fulfill their ghastly objective - to try to prevent the people from performing the pilgrimage safely[1].<br /><br />What is strange is now they want to create manufactured tears in the name of the victims of these accidents.<br /><br />They display eagerness in protecting the blood of the pilgrims, despite the fact that they have funded tens of militia in Iraq, Yemen and Syria in order to kill thousands of innocent Muslims. They have driven out millions from their homes, and have gathered for themselves heavy artillery which they have now spread throughout the lands of the Muslims in order to kill them.<br /><br />They have instilled hate into the hearts of those who have been deceived by them.<br /><br />May Allaah Protect the Muslims from the evil of these people, and guide those who have been led astray and deluded by them.<br /><br />They are those who dance in the event of killing and injury, and are at the forefront of displaying joy and happiness when such incidents occur. They drop on the Muslims the veil of at-Taqiyyah[2], using it as propaganda to spread their doubts.<br /><br />Clear daylight is surely visible for those who see with both eyes[3], and those who have been given by Allaah the ability to fairly analyze the truth from falsehood.<br /><br />They scream desperately and their objectives are exposed. As every day goes by, they do not increase except in disgrace. No accident takes place except that they show mischief. Whenever something bad befalls the Muslims, they always welcome it with happiness and delight. They want sorrow to spread amongst the Arab lands and the Muslims as they want you to be suppressed.<br /><br />[Khutbah entitled Fadl al-Ayaam al-Ma’doodaat,11/12/1436 – 25/9/2015]<br /><br /><br /><br />[1] The Shaykh is referring to the attempted-hijacking of the Haram by Iran-led Shia’s in 1987. This began as a Shia protest but a confrontation with the Saudi authorities led to a stampede which killed over 400 people and injured thousands. Even more despicable is the action of the Qaraamitah (commonly known as Ismaeeli’s today), a Shia sect that stemmed from Koofah in 317AH. Its leader was a man named Sulaymaan bin al-Hasan al-Qarmitee that took over the Haram and killed the Hujjaaj whilst they were performing Tawaaf. They threw the dead bodies in the well of Zamzam and corrupted its water. But before that, on the eight day of Hajj they slaughtered the masses in Minaa on the 8thof Dhu al-Hijjah (the first day of Hajj) and called this an act of sacrifice. As they left, they stole the black stone and took it with them to Koofah. As the stone was being liberated by the following Caliphate that took power, they refused a hand over the stone and opted to smash the stone into pieces instead. [see al-Bidaayah 37/15-39]<br />[2] See here for more information on at-Taqiyyah:http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2015/04/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html<br />[3] A simile given by many of the scholars in reference to ad-Dajjaal. He is the impostor and only sees with one eye, as for the Muwaahid, he is able to see clearly with two eyes and is able to decipher the truth from falsehood by it.
