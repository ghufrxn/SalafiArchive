<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Western Plot against the Muslim Woman</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</em><br /><br />O people, have Taqwaa of Allaah, the Exalted within, yourselves and as it relates to your families and your children. And know that the callers to westernism, from outside of our lands and within them, want to make the woman depart from the legislation of Al-Islaam and dress her with the western manner of dress; and remove from her every (trace of) modesty and decency; and that she should become like the Kaafir woman. They want this. Due to this, they speak about the Hijaab; they speak about free-mixing; they speak about the woman traveling which the legislator has restricted and demarcated. They want to divorce the woman from every legislative ruling which preserves her, protects her, and safeguards her; and that she should be like the western woman; like the Kaafir woman. No manners and no religion; no modesty and no chastity; like an animal! There is no might nor power except with Allaah. Where is your protection of your women?! Did not Allaah, the Majestic and High, say to you:<br /><br />الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء <br />Men are the protectors and maintainers of women. (An-Nisa 4:34)<br /><br />Where is your protection of the women?! Why do you leave her for the ravenous hungry wolves?! Are you in agreement with them? Do you feel safe for them? Will you not have Taqwaa of Allaah, O Muslims? You are in a time of Fitan; in a time of evil. That which is not done in the parties and gatherings is apparent on the screens and satellite channels. The women look at it and adopt it; within your homes. These things are displayed within your homes! Will you not have Taqwaa of Allaah, the Blessed and High?! Will you not safeguard your women and your children and fulfill the trust which Allaah has placed upon you and will ask you about on the Day of Standing?!<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-western-plot-against-the-muslim-woman-advice-from-shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan">http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-western-p ... al-fawzaan</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><em>Translated By: Raha ibn Donald Batts</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 31, 2017 12:25 am</p><hr />
