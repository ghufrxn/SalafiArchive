Is it permissible for the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) to pray without a head cover? Is wearing a cap sufficient? Please support your answer with evidences. May Allah protect you. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you). </strong></span><br /><br />A: There is nothing wrong with offering Salah without a turban because the head [with regard to men] is not included in `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), and it is not obligatory to cover it when offering Salah, whether the person praying is an Imam, a Munfarid (person offering Prayer individually), or a Ma’mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer).<br /><br />However, if wearing a turban is customary then it is best to do it, especially when offering Salah with others. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <strong><em><span style="color: #FF00FF">O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</span></em></strong> The turban is considered a type of adornment.<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">It is well known that men who are Muhrims (pilgrims in the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) offer Salah bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads while in Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah). Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with offering Salah bareheaded.</span></em> <br /><br />May Allah guide all to acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it! He is the All-Hearer and All-Respondent.<br /><br />As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh<br /><br />Source: alifta.net<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Q 10: Some people wear a turban, some wear a Qulunsuwah (cap), and many offer Salah (Prayer) with bare heads, I mean men. Which manner is the best in reward? We appreciate your advice, may Allah reward you with the best. </span></strong><br /><br />A: It is desirable for a Muslim to wear his full garment when going to Prayer, the head cover included; because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) enjoined His servants to adorn themselves when going to Salah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><em>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</em></strong><br /><br /><em>Besides, it has not been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he offered Salah without a head cover. In fact, he used to always wear a turban, and the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best guidance.</em><br /><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’<br />Chairman – Shaykh Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al Al-Shaykh<br /><br />Source: alifta.net</div>
