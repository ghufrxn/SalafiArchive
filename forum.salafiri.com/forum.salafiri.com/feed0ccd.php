<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Are the rulers; who rule by other than what Allaah has revealed considered to be disbelievers, and what if we were to say that they are Muslims. Then what would we say regarding Allaah’s saying:<br /><br /><em>{And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the disbelievers}</em> [1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> The rulers who rule by other than what Allaah has revealed are of many different ranks. To pass a verdict regarding them differs according to their beliefs and actions.<br /><br />1) Hence he who rules by other than what Allaah has revealed and believes it to be better then the revealed law of Allaah, then that person is considered a disbeliever according to all the Muslims.<br /><br />2) Also, the one who rules by man-made laws instead of the law of Allaah, and considers it to be permissible, even if he were to say:<br /><br /><em>‘‘without doubt to rule by the revealed law of Allaah is far more better,’’</em><br /><br />…then even in this case he is still considered a disbeliever because of him trying to be the one to legitimatize that which Allaah has ordained as unlawful.<br /><br />3) As for the one who rules by other than what Allaah has revealed because of following his whims, or corruption, or having enmity between himself and the one being judged upon, or for any other numerous reasons, and he knows that undoubtedly he is being disobedient to Allaah by ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed and what is incumbent upon him is to rule by the revealed law of Allaah, then he will be regarded as being from amongst the disobedient people and those who commit major sins.<br /><br />Furthermore, he will also be regarded as having committed minor disbelief [2] , minor oppression, and minor transgression. For this is the meaning that has been reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas [3] , [and his student] Tawoos [4] , and a group amongst the pious predecessors [5] [with regards to his condition] and this type of verdict [regarding him] is something which is well known by the people of knowledge. And Allaah is the possessor of all prosperity &amp; success.<br /><br /><em>Reference: Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz: 3/990-991</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Surah Alma’idaah Ayah no.44.<br /><br />[2] In explanation of what is minor disbelief. It has been narrated on the authority of Sufyaan bin Uyainaah who narrated from Hisham bin Hujair from Ta’woos from Ibn ‘Abbbas who said regarding the disbelief of the aforestated Ayah: It is not like the disbelief which expels you from the fold of Islaam.
