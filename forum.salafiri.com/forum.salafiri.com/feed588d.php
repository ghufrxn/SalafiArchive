Allaahul Musta’an<br /><br />    <em>Approximately in 1967/1387H when a student from Baloochistan submitted his admission papers to Madeenah University, he also attached his certificates and ijazahs for ahadeeth which he had received from Daar al-Uloom Islamiyyah Binnouri Town Karachi.</em><br /><br />    <em>The certificates and ijazahs stated that he had studied 9 books of Hadeeth in one year. Shaikh Abdul Azeez Ibn Abdullaah Ibn Baaz was shocked and startled when he read the paragraph mentioning the student had studied 9 books of Hadeeth and hence declared the certificate and ijazahs to be false as he thought this was impossible.</em><br /><br />    <em>The student was somewhat upset and so presented 2 supporting statements to Imaam Abdul Azeez Ibn Baaz of Shuyookh he knew. During this discourse Imaam Ibn Baaz came to know Hanafee Institutes in the Indian subcontinent would teach 9 books of Hadeeth in one year as as part or their syllabus.</em><br /><br />    <em>Upon hearing this Imaam Abdul Azeez Ibn Baaz said,</em><br />    <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“I swear by Allaah this is oppression on the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallahu Alayhee Wasallam)”</span></strong><br /><br />    (taken from the Biography of Shaikh Abdul Ghafoor Dhamaraanee)<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/3-excerpts-from-the-life-of-imaam-abdul-azeez-ibn-abdullaah-ibn-baaz-his-love-for-ahadeeth-and-the-deobandee-madrassah-binnouri-town/" class="postlink">Click here</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Dec 30, 2016 10:35 pm</p><hr />
