Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) <br /><br />A Summarised comprehensive discussion of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) is as follows: <br /><br />Name and lineage: <br /><br />Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Ibn Waa’il Ibn Haashim Ibn Sa’eed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Sahm Ibn Amr Ibn Hasees Ibn Ka’b Ibn Lu’ay Ibn Ghaalib al-Qurashee as-Sahmee al-Makkee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) <br /><br />Students: <br /><br />Aboo Umaamah As’ad Ibn Sahl Ibn Haneef (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Anas Ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Jubayr Ibn Nafeer al-Hadhramee, al-Hasan al-Basree, Humayd Ibn Abdurahmaan Ibn Awf, Zar Ibn Jaysh al-Asadee, Saalim Ibn Abee al-Ja’d, as-Saa’ib Ibn Furookh ash-Shaa’ir, Sa’eed Ibn Musayyab, Shuayb Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas Waalid Amr Ibn Shuayb, Ta’oos Ibn Kaysaan, Aamir ash-Shu’bee, Abdullah Ibn Buraydah al-Aslamee, Abdullah Ibn Ubaydullah Ibn Abee Maleekah, Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah, Ikrimah Mawlah Ibn Abbaas, Amr Ibn Deenar al-Makkee, Qaasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abee Bakr as-Siddeeq, Mujahid Ibn Jabr, Masrooq and Abu Burdah Ibn Abee Musa al-Ash’aree and other than them. Rahimahullah. <br /><br />Virtues: <br /><br />1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) gave Abdullah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) permission to write his hadeeth. (Sunan Abee Dawood: (no.3646) and its chain is authentic, Musnad Ahmad (2/162) <br /><br />2. Aboo Hurayrah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “There is none among the companions of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) who has narrated more Hadiths than I, except `Abdullah bin `Amr (bin Al-`As) who used to write them and I did not.” (Saheeh Bukharee (no.113) His written collection is famously known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah from the chain of Amr Ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather. (Also see al-Muwatta, Ibn al-Qaasim’s narration with my verification (pg.49-50) <br /><br />3. Handhalah Ibn Khuwaylid al-Anmbaree (al-Ghazzee/Thiqah) narrated: “I was with Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) and two men came arguing about the (cutting off the) head of Ammaar (Ibn Yassaar (Radiullahu anhu), both of these men were claiming to have killed him. Then Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Whichever one of you wants to be happy, then be happy (!) because I heard the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) say, “a rebel (rebellious, insurgent) group will kill him (Ammaar (Radiullahu anhu).” Mu’awiyah (Radiullahu anhu) said, “Why are you with us (in the battle of Sifin)?” He (Abdullah Ibn Amr (Radiullahu anhu) replied, “My father complained to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalaahu Alayhee wa sallam) about me, so he said (to me), “whilst your father is alive then obey (listen and follow him) and don’t disobey him”. So (that’s why) I am with you and I don’t kill and fight.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad (2/164-165) hadeeth (no.6538) and its chain is authentic). Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, “What is my connection with Sifin and what is my connection with killing and fighting the muslims? I wish that I died 10 years ago. By Allah! I didn’t strike a sword in this (battle), nor throw a spear and neither did I shoot an arrow. (Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’d (4/266) and its chain is authentic) <br /><br />Knowledge of narrations: <br /><br />The number of his narrations is 700 from which 7 are in the in the Saheehayn (TN. Saheehayn means the two Saheehs i.e. Saheeh Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim). <br /><br />Death: <br /><br />At the incident (event) of Hirrah, Dhul Hijjah 63 Hijri (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) <br /><br />There is a major difference of opinion as to when he died and the writer of this book has given preference the saying of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.
