<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Smoking is Haraam [impermissible] &amp; Advice How to Quit – Shaykh Abdur-Rahman al-Ajlaan.</span></span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">التدخين حرام ونصيحة للمدخنين الشيخ عبد الرحمن العجلان</span><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Is smoking Haraam?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> He says, “Is smoking Haraam?”<br /><br />We say to the questioner, for example is smoke from at-tayyibat (that which is pure) or from al-khabaith (that which is foul)?<br /><br />This is one question, a second question is, is smoke beneficial or harmful?<br /><br />No one in his right mind would claim that smoke is from at-tayyibat (that which is pure) due to its foulness and its harm.<br /><br />And no one in his right mind would say that smoke is beneficial or that it neither benefits nor harms. But, actually even the one who uses it would say that it is harmful.<br /><br />And the people of medicine have agreed upon it being harmful.<br /><br />So, even if it only had one of these two factors then it would be Haraam.<br /><br />So, smoke is Khabeeth.<br /><br />And Allaah has described our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings upon him) with making permissible for us at-tayyibat (that which is pure) and making forbidden upon us al-khabaith (that which is foul).<br /><br />So, it (smoking) is forbidden due to it being foul.<br /><br />The second factor is that it is harmful.<br /><br />And everything harmful is forbidden, even if it is not Khabeeth (foul, filthy). For example, dirt. Is it Khabeeth? No.<br /><br />Allaah has labelled it pure.<br /><br />One can purify oneself with it if there is no water or if one is unable to use it (water).<br />Therefore, it is not proper for us to label soil/dirt as being khabeeth (foul, impure) while Allaah has labelled it pure.<br /><br />However, dirt is harmful if a person were to eat dirt.<br /><br />Would we consent to someone saying that it is not Haraam upon you to eat dirt?<br /><br />He says it is Khabeeth? We say no. It is not Khabeeth. However, it is harmful.<br /><br />So, eating dirt is forbidden because it is harmful.<br /><br />So smoke (smoking) combines between these two factors foulness and being harmful.<br /><br />So, it (smoking) is forbidden and no one in his right mind would ever say it is tayyib or from at-tayyibat.<br /><br />And what is obligatory upon the Muslim is that he quits it if he is tested by it.<br /><br /><em> - And that he cures himself by quitting it by gradually using it less and less, step by step, and<br /> - by sitting with the righteous and<br /> - by attending the gatherings for seeking knowledge and<br /> - by reciting the Qur’an and<br /> - by staying away from the bad gatherings where smoke (smoking) is used.</em><br /><br />And by this, with the permission of Allaah, he will be safe from it.<br /><br /><em> - And that he seeks help by seeking nearness to Allaah by way of fasting and by increasing his recital of the Qur’an.<br /> - And increasing his supererogatory prayers.<br /> - And by staying in the Masjid.<br /> - And by staying away from the bad gatherings/sittings and by this the person will be safe (In Shaa Allaah).</em><br /><br />And him being safe from it (smoking) will be safety in his body, safety in his Deen (Religion), and safety in his wealth.<br /><br /><em>Translation Source: Masjid Tawheed Wa Sunnah of Durham, North Carolina</em><br /><br /><strong>Original Source &amp; Audio:</strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/is-smoking-haraam-sheikh-ajlaan-answers">http://mtws.posthaven.com/is-smoking-ha ... an-answers</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Video Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://audio-islam.com/2012/12/02/is-smoking-haraam-shaykh-abdur-rahman-al-ajlaan-video-audioar-en/">http://audio-islam.com/2012/12/02/is-sm ... udioar-en/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2016 10:26 pm</p><hr />
