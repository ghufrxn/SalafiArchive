<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Quantity Of Followers Was Never The Tool To Know/Test The Truth - Shaikh Al-Albani [Rahimahullah]</span></span></strong><br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,<br /><br /><em>“No Prophet from amongst the Prophets will have as many followers as me.</em><br /><br /><em>Indeed, there will be from amongst the Prophets he who had no one believing in him, except one man.” [1]</em><br /><br />Imaam Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee (d.1420H) commented upon this hadeeth, saying,<br /><br />“In this hadeeth is a clear proof that the abundance of followers, or lack thereof is not the measuring standard that indicates whether the caller is upon truth or falsehood. So even though the da’wah of these Prophets – ’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam – was one and their Religion was one, their varied with regards to the numbers of their followers. Some of them had many and some of them had a few, to the extent that some had no one to believe in them except one man. Rather, there was from amongst them he who had not a single follower!<br /><br />So in this is a profound lesson for the callers and those who are being called in this age of ours. So it is obligatory upon the caller to remember this reality. He must remain for a long time in the path of calling to Allaah the Exalted, and he must not pay any attention to the scarcity of those who answer him, because there is nothing upon him, except to convey the message clearly. And he has the best example in the previous Prophets who did not have anyone with them other than one or two men!<br /><br />So the one being called upon must not despair due to the scarcity of those who answer the caller, and he must not take that as a reason for doubting in the da’wah of truth and thus abandon eemaan (faith) in it, let alone that he would take that as an indication of the falsity of the da’wah with the argument that no one is following this caller, or that only a few are following him. And if his da’wah were truthful, the majority of the people would not follow him! Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said,<br /><br />“And most of mankind will not believe, even if you desire it eagerly.” [Soorah Yoosuf 12:103].” [2]<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Footnotes:</span></strong><br /><br />[1]: Related by Muslim (1/130).<br /><br />[2]: Refer to Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah (no. 397) of al-Albaanee.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Majority is not a Proof, by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzan (hafidhahullaah)</span></span></strong><br /><br />From the characteristics of the people of the Days of Ignorance is that they would view the majority as proof that something was true and the minority as proof hat something was false. So according to them, whatever the majority of the people was upon, that was the truth. And whatever the minority was upon, that was not the truth. In their eyes, this was the balance used to determine truth from falsehood.<br /><br />However, this is wrong, for Allah says: And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah’s path.<br /><br /><em>They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie. [Surah Al-An'aam, ayah 116]</em><br /><br />And He says:<br /><br /><em>But most of mankind doesn’t know. [Surah Al-A'raaf, ayah 187]</em><br /><br />And He says:<br /><br /><em>And most of them We found to be not true to their covenant, but most of them We found indeed to be evil sinners. [Surah Al-A'raaf, ayah 102]</em><br /><br />So the balance is not the majority and the minority. Rather, the balance is the truth. So whoever is upon the truth – even if he is by himself – he is the one who is correct and deserves to be emulated. And if the majority of the people are upon falsehood, then it is obligatory to reject them and not be deceived by them. So consideration is given to the truth. This is why the scholars say: “Truth is not known by way of men, but rather men are known by way of the truth.” So whoever is upon the truth, then he is the one we must follow and emulate.<br /><br />In Allaah’s stories about the prior nations, He informs us that it is always the minority that is upon the truth, as Allah says:<br /><br /><em>And no one believed with him except for a few. [Surah Hood, ayah 40]</em><br /><br />And in a hadeeth in which the nations were presented to the Prophet, he (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said that he saw a prophet who had a small group of followers with him, and a Prophet who had a man or two men following him, and another Prophet who had no one with him. (Sahih Al-Bukhari).<br /><br />So consideration is not given to which opinion or view has the most followers. Rather, consideration is given to its being either true or false. So whatever is true, even though a minority of the people or no one is upon it – so long as it is the truth – it must be adhered to, for indeed it is salvation. Falsehood is not aided by the fact that it has a majority of people following it – ever. This is a determining measure that the Muslim must always abide by.<br /><br />The Prophet (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Islam began strange and it will return back to being strange as it began.”</strong> (Saheeh Muslim)<br /><br />This will occur at the time when evil, calamities and misguidance increase. So no one will remain upon the truth except for the strange ones amongst the people and those who extract themselves from their tribes (for the sake of their religion). They will become strangers in their society.<br /><br />The Messenger (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent while the whole world was submersed in disbelief and misguidance. And when he called the people, only one or two answered his call. It was only until later on that they grew to be many. The tribe of Quraish, not to mention the whole of the Arabian Peninsula and the whole world, was upon misguidance. And the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was the only one calling the people. So those who followed him were few with respect to the entire world.<br /><br />So consideration is not given to the majority. Consideration is only given to what is correct and to achieving the truth. Yes, if the majority of the people are upon correctness, then that is good. However, the way of Allaah is that the majority of the people is always upon falsehood.<br /><br /><em>And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly. [Surah Yoosuf, ayah 103]</em><br /><br /><em>And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah’s path. They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie. [Surah Al-An'aam, ayah 116]</em><br /><br />* [In his sharh (explanation) of Imam Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhab's (rahimahullaah) statement: <em>From the greatest of their principles was that they would be deluded by the majority, using that to determine the correctness of a matter. They would also determine the falsehood of something if it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allaah brought them the opposite of that, clarifying this in many places of the Qur`an.]</em><br /><br /><em>Source: Sharh Masaa’il-ul-Jaahiliyyah (pg. 60-62) of Shaikh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab (rahimahullaah), via al-Ibaanah.</em><br /><br />May ALLAH Helps us all to understand His Deen better, as it was understood by Pious Predecessor [As Salaf As Saalih]. Aaameeeen<br /><br />_______________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Criteria for the Truth is Neither Having a Large Following Nor Being an Eloquent Speaker By Shaykh ’Abdul’Azeez bin Rayyis ar-Rayyis</span></span></strong><br /><br />The criteria for truth are that you look at a man’s condition and assess:<br /><br />Is his da’wah based on the  Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu ’alayhi wassallam), and what the Salaf  us-Salih from the Sahabah, Tabi’een and those who followed them, traversed or not?<br /><br />If so, then  he is a caller to truth.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">An error</span><br /><br />with those who do not know is that they think that the criteria of  da’wah is that a man has a lot of followers or that those who attend his lessons and lectures are  many, <span style="color: #FF0000">yet this is a major error.</span><br /><br />For the Prophet (sallallahu ’alayhi wassallam) stated, as reported in  the Saheeh from the hadeeth of Ibn ’Abbas (radi Allahu ’anhu),<br /><br /><em>“A Prophet will come on the Day  of Judgement and he will have a man or two with him. Then another Prophet will come with a  group of men with him, while another Prophet will come with a small group of followers. Then  another Prophet will come with no followers with him whatsoever.”</em><br /><br />This is a Prophet! Allah  chose him to have this great status and yet with that he will come with no one with him; his  da’wah is still successful without doubt because he is Prophet.<br /><br />So the criteria of truth is not  having many followers, rather from what the Prophet (sallall hu ’alayhi wassallam) informed of, is  that, in the hadeeth of Abu  Hurayrah and Ibn ’Umar, and in the wording of Abu  Hurayrah (as  reported in Saheeh Muslim): The Messenger of Allah said:<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #FF0000">“Islam began as something strange, and will  return (to being) strange as it began, Toobah is for the Ghurab (strangers).”</span></em><br /><br />Thus, the people of truth are a few yet this is not a proof of their da’wah being erroneous. Rather, when you read the Book of Allah you will find that Allah in many verses clarifies that the people of batil are many and the people of truth are few. Allah says,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #FF0000">“…and among them is he who is guided, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.” {Hadeed (57): 26}</span></em><br /><br />And Allah says,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #FF0000"> “And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of  Allah.” {al-’An’am (6): 116}</span></em><br /><br />Therefore,<br /><br />having many followers is neither the criteria for the truth nor is eloquence and  articulacy because many people see an eloquent man who is articulate and poetic and think that  he is on the truth due to that, and this is a mistake.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Yes, eloquence, being articulate and poetic if  used in order to support Allah’s deen is sought-after; yet it is not the criteria for truth or batil.</span></strong><br /><br />This  eloquence and articulacy has to be looked at to see:<br /><br />if it is being used to support the deen or not.  If it is being used to support Allah’s Book, the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu ’alayhi  wassallam) and the way of the first and foremost ones then bring this (eloquence)!<br /><br />But if it (such  eloquence and articulacy) is being used in a way which opposes Allah’s Shariah then it is  unacceptable.<br /><br />Source: <em><strong>[From the Book: A Critique of the Statements of Dr Ā’id al-Qarnī by Shaykh ’Abdul’Azeez bin Rayyis ar-Rayyis, pg 5-6, Third Introduction]</strong></em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Sep 13, 2016 1:17 am</p><hr />
