So it is more recommended for them to make supplication, and the virtue for them is greater than it is for those who are not performing Hajj.<br /><br />As for the rest of the people – who are not performing Hajj – then it is legislated for them to supplicate and to strive with (plentiful) supplication on this day (of Arafah); so that they can share with their brothers who are performing Hajj in this virtue.<br /><br />And the Prophet sallAllaahu `alaihi wa sallam said: “The best of supplication is the supplication of Arafah, and the best thing that I and the prophets before me have said is:<br /><br />لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ<br /><br />Laa ilaaha illAllaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa Huwa alaa kulli shayinn qadeer<br /><br />‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner. Sovereignty is His, and all praise is for Him, and He has full power and ability over everything.'”<br /><br />So supplication is legislated on the day of Arafah for the one performing Hajj and for other than him, but for the one performing Hajj it is more emphasized and more virtuous, because of that which he is carrying out from the Hajj rites, and because of the tremendous virtue of the place he is in.<br /><br />As for the time, and the virtue of the time, then that is something shared by (both) the pilgrims as well as those people who are not performing Hajj.<br /><br />And as for the virtue of the place then it is specific to the people performing Hajj – i.e. and it is the standing at Arafah.<br /><br />[Source: Shaykh al-Fawzan’s official website: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/8980">http://alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/8980</a><!-- m --> ]<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/09/29/striving-with-regards-to-supplication-on-the-day-of-arafah-is-general-for-the-pilgrim-and-other-than-him/</strong><br /><br />Share this:</div>
