In this way we eliminate the root causes of our problems so when these books don’t exist nor will these issues.”<br /><br />They pondered for a short while and then said,<br /><br />“As you very well know these issues are spread throughout the different books and an average person is not able to read them, however you (ie Allaamah Ehsaan) have collated and compiled all of these issues in one book and therefore you want to disunite the Muslims.”<br /><br />I said,<br /><br />“Yes, i have collated and compiled all of the beliefs (of the shee’ahs) thereby making it easy and accessible for everyone to read and understand.”<br /><br />(taken from ash-Sheeah Wa Ahlul Bayt pg.8)<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shiah-papers-part-4-the-solution-to-the-sunni-shiah-dispute-if-only-the-shiah-rafihah-agree-allamah-ehsan-ilahi-zaheer-1407h/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 11:10 pm</p><hr />
