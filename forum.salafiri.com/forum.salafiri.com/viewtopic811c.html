[As occurs in the narration reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 986]<br /><br />(2) Also from the wisdoms is that in it is an apparent manifestation, and an announcement of the Eid prayer in all of the marketplaces of that land.<br /><br />(3) Likewise from the wisdoms is that one can see the condition of the people of the marketplaces – from the poor people and other than them. [So that he can give charity to the poor people (that he meets) on the second path. And Allaah knows best. See page no. 223]<br /><br />(4) They said that from the wisdoms is that the two paths will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection.<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/09/27/the-wisdom-in-returning-from-the-eid-prayer-via-a-different-route/</strong><br /><br />Share this:</div>
