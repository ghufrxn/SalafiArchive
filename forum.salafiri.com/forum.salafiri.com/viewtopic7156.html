				<div class="content">Shaikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan was asked, “Many of the people say that the refuters of Ahlul Bidah are separators, causing separation?”<br /><br />The Shaikh replied:<br /><br />“Yes, they cause separation between truth and falsehood. This is correct. We make a distinction between the truth and falsehood, between the people of truth and those of falsehood. We are going to refute ahl ul bidah and so did the scholars refute ahl ul bidah. This is not the cause of division, but its to gather the people upon the truth, because with people remaining upon misguidance and the speech which is falsehood then it is this that causes division amongst the muslims. As for clarifying the truth for the people, so they can gather upon it, then this is the dawah towards unity and not the dawah towards separation. The dawah towards separation is when it is said ‘the people of falsehood are not to be refuted’. This is dawah of disunity if only they ponder! And allah knows best”{Q&amp;A session, Riyaadh, 2011}<br /><br />This is a short but tremendous advise and reply by Shaikh Fawzaan, may allah preserve him. One can see with great clarity from the shaikhs words tha he allies truth and falsehood as matters which cannot be mixed and similarly equates this by saying that the possessors, that is, people of truth and falsehood cannot therefore mix. A fundamental principle summarised by the sheikh in a few words, glory be to Allah.<br /><br />Noble reader, despite such clarifications you will still here some that say that their is no point in refuting ahl ul bidah or even speaking about them. Some go further and say that ‘ to discuss and backbite Ahlul Bidah is a waste of time and of no benefit’. So what then?
