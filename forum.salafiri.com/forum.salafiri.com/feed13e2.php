Allaah, the Most High, said:<br /><br /><ul><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>Of every troop of them, a taa-ifah(group) only should go forth to fight jihaad.</strong></span></em><br />Soorah at Tawbah (9) aayah 122</ul><br />As for <em>al-furqah</em> with a damma then it is taken from <em>al-iftiraaq</em> (splitting).<br /><br /><em>An-naajiyah</em> (“saved”) is an active participle from the verb najaa (to be saved) when the person is safe and secure – saved in the worldly life from innovations, safe and secure from them, and saved in the Hereafter from the Fire.<br /><br />And the aspect [confirming] that is that the Prophet sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam said:<br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>This nation will split into 73 firqahs (sects), all of them in the Fire except one.<br />They said: And which is that one, O Messenger of Allaah?<br />He said: That which is upon the like of that which I and my Companions are upon.</em></span>[1]<br /><br />This hadeeth explains to us the meaning of <em>an-naajiyah</em>. So whoever is upon the like of that which the Prophet sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam and his Companions were upon, then he is <em>naaj</em> (saved) from innovations.<br /><br />And:<br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">All of them are in the Fire except for one.</span></em></strong><br /><br />So it (this group) is naajiyah (saved) from the Fire.<br /><br />So najaah (being saved) here is from innovations in this worldly life and from the Fire in the Hereafter.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Taken from Sharh al Aqeedatul Waasitiyyah of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen, page 38-39</span></strong> <br /><br /><em>Translator Nasser ibn Najam – words in brackets and footnotes are the translator’s</em><br /><br />[1] Reported by at Tirmidhee in the Book of Eemaan, the Chapter of that which has been reported about the splitting of this nation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Jan 08, 2017 11:03 pm</p><hr />
