				<div class="content"><em>Adaptation: Taalib Alexander</em><br /><br />1. They are the followers of Syrian Muslim ideologue ‘Muhammad Zain-ul-Abidin Surur’.<br /><br />2. Surur was born in Syria in 1938 CE;<br /><br />3. He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood – Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen – leaving Syria after the Ikhawani insurrection for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;<br /><br />4. In Saudia Arabia he was a teacher in the Mahad al-Ilmi in Buraidah.<br /><br />5. From among his students is Salman al-Awdah;<br /><br />6. After leaving Saudi he moved to Kuwait then the United Kingdom where he set up a number of organisations. From among them: Markaz Dirasat al-Sunnah al-Nabawwiyah in Birmingham and al-Muntada al-Islami in London. He founded as-Sunnah Magazine which was one of the main organs for propagating his thought;<br /><br />7. The main characteristic of Surur and his dawah are:<br /><em><ul>A. Apparently holding the main principles of Salafee creed while following the methodology – manhaj – of the Muslim brotherhoods;<br />B. Affirming the methodology of Sayyid Qutub;<br />C. Apparently affirming the three categories of Towheed while adding an extra category – something rejected by the scholars – called Towheed-ul-Hakimiyyah;<br />D. Promoting a political agenda at the expense of dawah and calling to Towheed;<br />E. Calling to unity irrespective of Aqeedah;<br />F. Undermining the Salafi scholars through – false – doubts and aspersions;<br />G. Organising their followers, Like the Ikhaan-ul-Muslimun, into secret cluster – often called’families’ – in which baya’ah- Oath of Alleginece – may be requested (for example, Ittihad al-Islami of Somalia, a Muntada lead organisation);</ul></em><br /><br />8. Suroor declared apostates those who committed a major sin a belief held by the Khawaarij;<br /><br />9. Suroor claimed – erroneously – that the books of creed (‘Aqeedah) are dry due to them consisting of texts from the Qur’aan and Sunnah;<br /><br />10. Suroor claimed – erroneously – that the scholars of Towheed are ‘slaves of slaves of slaves of the slave and their ultimate master is a Christian’ (i.e. George H. Bush);<br /><br />11. Suroor claimed – erroneously – that the scholars of Towheed are ‘liars’, ‘hypocrites’ and ‘spies’;<br /><br />12. Suroor praised Hassan Turabi who: permits the Muslim to revert to Christianity or Judaism, claims it is not permissible to say that Jews or Christians are not believers,<br /><br />13. Their praise of the one – he is Muhammad al-Ghazaalee – who makes fun of the hijab calling it a ‘tent’;<br /><br />14. Suroor claimed – erroneously – that ‘flags’ and ‘pictures of leaders’ are ‘false idols from the false idols of our age’;</div>
