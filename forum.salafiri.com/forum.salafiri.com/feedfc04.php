<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[17] Question:</span></strong> What do you say with regard to the two tafseer books <em>Fath-ul-Bayaan</em> and <em>Tafseer Al-Manaar</em>?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> The tafseer book &quot;Al-Manaar&quot; is more beneficial than Fath-ul-Bayaan. And it deals with many of the problems the Muslims are facing today. It has sections of research on sociological, political and historical issues that are not found in the books of Tafseer that are well known from the past. Rather, they cannot even be found in the books of contemporary authors. This is because Sayyid Rasheed Ridaa was a big scholar as well as an enlightened Muslim politician. However, at the same time, the book contains some aversions from the Sunnah in many places, such as the reports of 'Eesaa, the Dajjaal and the Mahdee. Likewise, it has some fataawaa (legal rulings) of his concerning wearing European hats and clothes, which he issued in his early years, but from which he excused himself (some time afterward).<br /><br />[Al-Asaalah, Issue #10]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Thu Mar 02, 2017 3:27 pm</p><hr />
