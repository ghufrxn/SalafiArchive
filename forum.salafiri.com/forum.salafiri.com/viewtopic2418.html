				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Instructing the Student on How to Open the Gates of Knowledge and Comprehension</span></strong><br /><em>by Muhammad ibn ash-Shaykh ‘Alee ibn Aadam al-Ithyoobee</em><br /><br />Translated by Aboo Shaybah<br /><br />A short poem containing vital guidelines for a student to follow from the onset of learning and throughout the duration of study. (Taken from <em>al-Fawaa’id as-Samiyyah</em>, pg.28-29)<br /><br />[1] To anyone who desires to open the gates of knowledge<br /><em>and become outstanding in comprehension:</em><br /><br />[2] Observe Taqwaa of Allaah and adhere to the Sunan,<br /><em>and remain far away from people of notoriety and turmoil.</em><br /><br />[3] And tread, in your conduct, the course of the Salaf,<br /><em>and stay away from the innovations of the Khalaf;</em><br /><br />[4] for every good lies in following the Salaf<br /><em>and every ill lies in the innovations of the Khalaf.</em><br /><br />[5] To anyone who desires to lead others<br /><em>in knowledge, spreading its good to all:</em><br /><br />[6] Stay sincere to your Lord and set your standards high,<br /><em>and you shall find yourself gifted with aptitude.</em><br /><br />[7] The effort comes from you, and then opening the gates<br /><em>comes from your Lord, the All-Acquainted Watcher, the Bestower.</em><br /><br />[8] He promised guidance to those who strive and struggle<br /><em>saying: “We shall most certainly guide them,” so seek direction from this.</em><br /><br />[9] However, effort alone will be futile<br /><em>if not completed by the opening from Him.</em><br /><br />[10] Thus, may Allaah, the Most Generous, have mercy upon anyone who<br /><em>in a time like this devotes himself</em><br /><br />[11] to seeking this noble knowledge, turning away<br /><em>from all distraction, and rejecting the lowly;</em><br /><br />[12] embarking in earnest, kneeling down<br /><em>before the possessors of guidance, attentively listening;</em><br /><br />[13] writing everything that he hears,<br /><em>noting all the points that which will be to his advantage;</em><br /><br />[14] memorizing and revising what he recorded<br /><em>with his esteemed, guiding peers;</em><br /><br />[15] that is the one who will have the gates opened for him<br /><em>by his Lord, who removes all barriers.</em><br /><br />[16] We ask You, O Allaah, to bless us<br /><em>with knowledge, Taqwaa, and Jannah – the abode of happiness.</em><br /><br /><strong>Source &amp; Arabic Version Available Here:</strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
