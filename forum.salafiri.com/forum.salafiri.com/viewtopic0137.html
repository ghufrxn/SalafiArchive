We seek Allaah’s’ refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah misguides none can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ is His slave and Messenger.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam.&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-­Watcher over you. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great achievement. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />To proceed: The truest speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ. The worst of affairs are the newly invented matters, every newly invented matter is an innovation, every innovation is a misguidance, and misguidance is in the fire….[1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">To proceed:</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed from the greatest of trials which have befallen the Muslim Ummah[2] today is Bida’ (innovations in religion). It has saturated the Muslim world completely, to such an extent that hardly anywhere is free from it and only a few people are saved from it.<br /><br />The subject of Bida’ is of great importance as it can lead to Kufr (disbelief).<br /><br />The innovators (mubtadi) oppose Allaah in His commands; therefore it is fitting that their repentance will not be accepted.<br /><br />Abdullaah bin Abbas[3] – May Allaah be pleased with him, said: Verily the most hated of matters to Allaah are Bida’.[4]<br /><br />Sufyaan at-Thawree[5] said: Bida’ is more beloved to Iblees than sins. Repentance from a sin is accepted; however there is no repentance for Bida’.[6] [7]<br /><br />One of the main reasons, for the widespread practice of Bida’, is the prevailing belief that Bida’ is permissible and acceptable.  The innovators have labelled this misconception as ‘Bida’ hassanah’ (a Bida’ which they regard as good and beneficial).  Therefore those upholding the validity of Bida’ hassanah, will claim ‘Indeed it is a good Bida’!’  This shows they accept the fact that it is a Bida’, but regard it as good!!<br /><br />Scholars of the past and present have covered this issue extensively and have authored many good books concerning it, books about this are lengthy and elaborate, which can be difficult for the average student to digest.  Though more concise books are available, they fail to address the issue successfully. Many of these books, cover the regulations concerning Bida’, but do not focus specifically on the topic of Bida’ hassanah.<br /><br />This book Insha’Allaah, is a concise refutation, clarifying the position of Ahlu-Sunnah concerning those who believe in the validity of Bida’ hassanah, illustrating that all Bida’ is in the fire without any exceptions.<br /><br />[1] This is the Khutbat ul-Haajah, which the Prophet used to say before starting a speech which he also used to teach to his Companions, refer to shaykh al-Albaanee’s booklet ‘Khutbat ul-Haajah’.<br /><br />[2] Nation – Refers to all of the Muslims collectively.<br /><br />[3] The great companion of the Messenger of Allaah, his name is Abdullaah bin Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, the son of the uncle of the Messenger of Allaah.  He was 13 years of age when the Messenger of Allaah passed away, he was known has the scholar of the Ummah.  He died in 70 A.H. in Taif.  It is authentically narrated that the Messenger of Allaah embraced him and supplicated ‘O Allaah teach him the wisdom.’  Ibn Umar said of him:’ He was the most knowledgeable from the Ummah of Muhammad about what was revealed to Muhammad.’<br /><br />[4]Al-Bayhaqee in al-Kubra (4/316).<br /><br />[5] Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree (161 A.H.) was born in Koofah in a place called Thawr, his kunya is Abu Abdullaah, he narrated many ahadeeth &amp; many scholars say that he was the Ameer ul Mumineen of hadeeth of his time.  His father was also a great Muhaddith (Scholar of hadeeth).<br /><br />AbdAllaah ibn Mubarak said: ‘I wrote hadeeth from over 1,100 shaykhs &amp; I didn’t write from anyone better than Sufyaan.<br /><br />Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: The Angels are the guardians of the heavens &amp; the Companions of hadeeth (as-haabul hadeeth) are the guardians in the earth.<br /><br />Refer to Thahdheeb at thahdheeb by Ibn Hajar 2/56 &amp; Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubalaa by adh-Dhahabee 7/229.<br /><br />[6] That is because the Mubtadi’ thinks his action is good, and regards it as something that will cause him to come closer to Allaah Azza wa Jal. For this reason he does not think of repenting from Bida’, rather he seeks reward for it as Allaah says: &lt;&lt; Is he, then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair-seeming, so that he considers it as good (equal to one who is rightly guided?)  &gt;&gt; (Fatir: 8), There is a difference regarding the sinner he sees himself as having shortcomings, he acknowledges that his action is evil, and if he is advised he repents. If a sinner repents to Allaah, He forgives their sins, and accepts their repentance, we ask Allaah for safety, goodness, capability and guidance.<br /><br />[7]Al-Laalikaa’ee (1/132), &amp; Abu Naeem in al-Hilyah (7/26) &amp; al-Bagawee in Sharh as-Sunnah (1/216).<br /><br /><a href="viewtopicc61b.html?f=13&amp;t=1273" class="postlink">View Part Two Here</a><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/bida-hassanah-part-1/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ah-part-1/</a><!-- m --></div>
