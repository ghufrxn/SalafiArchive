				<h3>Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu)</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Oct 07, 2016 8:59 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Abu Ubaydah</strong></div>
				<div class="content">A Summarised comprehensive biography of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) is as follows:<br /><br />Name and lineage: <br /><br />Abu Musa Abdullah Ibn Qays Ibn Sulaym Ibn Hadhar Ibn Harb Ibn Amir Ibn Atr Ibn Bakr Ibn Amir Ibn Udhar Ibn Wa'il Ibn Najiyah Ibn Jumahir Ibn al-Ash'ar al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) <br /><br />Students:<br /><br />Aswad Ibn Yazid an-Nakha'i, Anas Ibn Malik al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu), al-Hasan al-Basri, Hitan Ibn Abdullah ar-Riqashi, Rabi Ibn Harash, Zahdam Ibn Mudrib al-Jurmi, Zayd Ibn Wahb al-Juhani, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Radi Allahu Anhu), Sa'id Ibn Jubayr, Sa'id Ibn al-Musayib, Abu Wa'il Shaqiq Ibn Salamah al-Asadi, Tariq Ibn Shihab, Amir ash-Shu'bi, Abdullah Ibn Buraydah, Abu Abdurahman Abdullah Ibn Habib as-Sulami, Abdurahman Ibn Ganam al-Ash'ari, Abu Uthman Abdurahman Ibn Mal an-Nahdi, Alqamah Ibn Qays an-Nakha'i, Qays Ibn Abi Hazim, Masruq, Abu Burdah Ibn Abi Musa and Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Musa and other than them. <br /><br />Virtues:<br /><br />1. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said to Abu Musa (Radi Allahu Anhu), &quot;That the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said to him' &quot;O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the mazamir (sweet melodious voices) of the family of David.'&quot; <br /><br />(Sahih Bukhari no.5048, Sahih Muslim no.793, Sunan at-Tirmidhi no.3855, and he said, &quot;Garib Hasan Sahih&quot;)<br /><br />There is an established hadith from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) with the same meaning from Buraydah (Radi Allahu Anhu) without Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) being present. <br /><br />(See Sahih Muslim no.793, Darusalam numbering 1851) <br /><br />Also see Sunan Ibn Majah (hadith no.1341, from Abu Huraira (Radi Allahu Anhu) and its chain is [Hasan] good)<br /><br />2. Iyadh Ibn Amr al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said about Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu), &quot;The meaning of the ayah &quot;Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him&quot; (al-Ma'idah ayah no.54) refers to you and your people.&quot; (al-Mustadrak al-Hakim 2/313 hadith no.3220, the meaning and chain is Hasan good)<br /><br />3. Anas Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, &quot;Tomorrow some people will come to you who have more empathy to Islam than you.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad 3/155, hadith no.12582, and its chain is authentic) <br /><br />Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (Radi Allahu Anhu) was present in those people who came that are mentioned in the above hadith.<br /><br />There are numerous virtues and merits of him just as Hafidh Mizi has written. (Tahdhib al-Kamal 4/244) <br /><br />4. Hafidh Ibn Hajr said, &quot;He was a famous companion (Radi Allahu Anhu). Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) appointed him as Amir (of Kufah and Basrah) and afterwards Uthman (Radi Allahu Anhu) appointed him. During the battle of Siffin he was one of the two judges. (Taqhrib at-Tahdhib no.3542) <br /><br />5. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) said as part of a hadith, &quot;...O Allah! forgive the sins of Abdullah Ibn Qays (Abu Musa al-Ash'ari) and admit him to a noble entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;(Sahih Bukhari no.4323, Sahih Muslim no.2498) <br /><br />6. He (Radi Allahu Anhu) accepted the good news of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). (Sahih Bukhari no.4328, Sahih Muslim no.2497, Darusalam numbering no.6405) <br /><br />Knowledge Of Narrations:<br /><br />There are 360 ahadith present in the Musnad of Imam Baqi Ibn Makhlad. In the Sahihayn there are 49 ahadith which have been narrated by him. <br /><br />In al-Arba'in fil Hath Alal Jihad of Ibn Asakir there is one hadith which is no.17.<br /><br />In The Battle Field:<br /><br />He was present in the battle of Khaybar and also participated in the other Jihadi expeditions. (Radi Allahu Anhu) <br /><br />Death:<br /><br />50 Hijri or after it. 74 and Allah knows best.<br /><br />Some people have also said that it is 42 Hijri. According to adh-Dhahabi the most correct is 44 Hijri. (an-Nubala 2/398) <br /><br />Note:<br /><br />There is a narration which goes against him in the book al-Ma'rifah wa at-Tarikh of al-Imam Ya'qub Ibn Sufyan al-Farisi (2/771) and Tarikh Dimishq of Ibn Asakir. However this chain is weak due to the An of the Mudalis A'mash. (For the narration see Sir 'Alam an-Nubala 2/393- 394)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.salafiri.com/40-hadith-shaikh-ul-islam-imam-ibn-taymiyyah-hadith-no-17-a-treasure-of-jannah-by-shaikh-zubair-ali-zai-1435h/" class="postlink">http://www.salafiri.com/40-hadith-shaikh-ul-islam-imam-ibn-taymiyyah-hadith-no-17-a-treasure-of-jannah-by-shaikh-zubair-ali-zai-1435h/</a></div>
