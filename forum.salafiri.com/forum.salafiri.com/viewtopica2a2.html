				<div class="content"><strong>&quot;Our Aqīdah is the same as the Sahābah and Salaf Ṣālīhīn.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Sīr Aʿlām an-Nubalā 20/442)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;It is upon you to follow (the Qurʾān and Sunnah) and not commit to Bidʿah and you should follow the Madhab of the Salaf Ṣālīhīn and this is the straight path which you should walk upon.&quot;* </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Fath ur-Rabānī: Al-Majlis ul-ʿĀshir pg no.35) </em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;It is upon the believer to follow the Sunnah and the group who acts according to the Sunnah . The Sunnah is what the Prophet (Sallalāhū ʾAlayhī Wa Salam) declared and the group is what the Sahābah agreed upon.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/165)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Our Aqīdah is that Imān comprises of testifying it on the tongue, accepting it in the heart and acting upon the pillars of Islām. Imān increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience. It is strengthened with knowledge and is weakened with ignorance. Whilst all this is only obtained due to the power of Allah.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/135)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Whosoever wants to enter Islām then that individual should pronounce the testimony of faith (Kalima) and should announce of being free from all religions except the religion of Islāmand should accept the Wahdaniya of Allah in the heart.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/13)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;(In regards to the names and attributes of Allah) we do not go outside the Qurʾān and Sunnah. We recite the āyah or Hadīth and have Imān in it and leave the knowledge of how it is to Allah.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/127)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Our Aqīdah is that the Qurʾān is the kalām of Allah...&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/127)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;The whole of the people of Islām agree that Muhammad (Sallalāhū ʾAlayhī Wa Salam) Bin ʿAbdullah Bin Abdulmutalib is the Messenger of Allah. He is the Imām of all the Messengers and the last Prophet.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/127)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;It is obligatory to have Imān in the resurrection from the grave and the day of judgement.</strong>&quot; <br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/146)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;The humankind should praise Allah, send Durūd upon the Prophet (Sallalāhū ʾAlayhī Wa Salam) and then ask their needs from Allah.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/92)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;It is Makrūh (meaning haram) to swear an oath on ones father, grandfather (ancestors) or anyone other than Allah. Therefore if one wants to swear an oath then the individual should swear by Allah or remain silent.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/92)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;When you go to visit the grave then the individual should not touch the grave and neither kiss it because this is the custom of the Jews. Neither should the individual sit on the grave....then ask Allah for your needs.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/91)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Superstition is Harām however there is no harm in fāl (saying good things i.e encouragement).&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 1/92)</em><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Do not look at the condition (actions and sayings) of the Ṣālīhīn but rather look at that which is narrated from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalāhū ʾAlayhī Wa Salam) and trust upon it (the Hadīth) even if that means one becomes alone and unique in doing so compared to other people.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Al-Gunyah 2/149)</em><br /><br /><em>Compiled by Abu Ubaydah</em></div>
