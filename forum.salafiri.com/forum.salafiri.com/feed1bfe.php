<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Difference Between The Types Of Shart (Conditions)</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee Rahimahullaah [1422H]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />How do we differentiate between the: shart al-wujoob (condition of obligation), shart as-sihhah (condition of correctness) and shart al-kamaal (condition of perfection)?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />That which I recall is that they say concerning the condition of correctness that it is like the wudhoo for the prayer, and the condition of obligation is like the time of the prayer and the nisaab (minimum amount of property liable for payment) of zakaat. So the condition of obligation does not necessitate for you that you have to go and acquire it; nor doe it necessitate that you have to come with the time in order for you to pray, nor does it necessitate that you go out and work so that you will be eligible to pay zakat and so due to it you pay. As for the condition of perfection, then perhaps its like is found in the like of the hadeeth in which the Prophet (Sallaallaahu ‘alaihi wa ‘alaa aalihi wa sallam) said: ((none of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself)) (Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) meaning: he does not believe with Eemaan which is perfect, since there is found within it a condition.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee</span></strong><br /><em>Ghaaratul Ashritah, volume 1, page 184</em><br /><br />Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=338">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=338</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 10, 2017 10:26 pm</p><hr />
