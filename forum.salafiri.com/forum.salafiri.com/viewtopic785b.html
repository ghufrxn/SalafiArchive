				<div class="content">Imām Bukhārī, the esteemed teacher of Imām Tirmidhī establishes the same chapter heading, <br /><br />باب وَضْعِ الْيُمْنَى عَلَى الْيُسْرَى<br /><br />“Chapter To place the right hand on the left”<br /><br />حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ مَسْلَمَةَ، عَنْ مَالِكٍ، عَنْ أَبِي حَازِمٍ، عَنْ سَهْلِ بْنِ سَعْدٍ، قَالَ كَانَ النَّاسُ يُؤْمَرُونَ أَنْ يَضَعَ الرَّجُلُ الْيَدَ الْيُمْنَى عَلَى ذِرَاعِهِ الْيُسْرَى فِي الصَّلاَةِ‏<br /><br />Abd Allah bin Maslamah narrated to us on the authority of Malik on the authority of Abi Hazim on the authority of Sahl bin Sa’d (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said “The people were ordered that a person should place the right hand on the left forearm in the prayer.” (Bukhari no.740)<br /><br />Bukhari establishes the following chapter heading<br /><br />بَابُ مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ فِي الْجَنَابَةِ ثُمَّ غَسَلَ سَائِرَ جَسَدِهِ، وَلَمْ يُعِدْ، غَسْلَ مَوَاضِعِ الْوُضُوءِ مَرَّةً أُخْرَى<br /><br /><br />حَدَّثَنَا يُوسُفُ بْنُ عِيسَى، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا الْفَضْلُ بْنُ مُوسَى، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا الأَعْمَشُ، عَنْ سَالِمٍ، عَنْ كُرَيْبٍ، مَوْلَى ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، عَنْ مَيْمُونَةَ، قَالَتْ وَضَعَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَضُوءًا لِجَنَابَةٍ فَأَكْفَأَ بِيَمِينِهِ عَلَى شِمَالِهِ مَرَّتَيْنِ، أَوْ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ فَرْجَهُ، ثُمَّ ضَرَبَ يَدَهُ بِالأَرْضِ ـ أَوِ الْحَائِطِ ـ مَرَّتَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ مَضْمَضَ وَاسْتَنْشَقَ، وَغَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ وَذِرَاعَيْهِ، ثُمَّ أَفَاضَ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ الْمَاءَ، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ جَسَدَهُ، ثُمَّ تَنَحَّى فَغَسَلَ رِجْلَيْهِ‏.‏ قَالَتْ فَأَتَيْتُهُ بِخِرْقَةٍ، فَلَمْ يُرِدْهَا، فَجَعَلَ يَنْفُضُ بِيَدِهِ‏.‏<br /><br /><br />It was narrated to us by Yusuf bin Isa who said al-Fadal bin Musa informed us who said al-A’mash informed us on the authority of Salim on the authority of Kuraib, the servant of Ibn Abbas on the authority of Ibn Abbas on the authority of Maimunah who said Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out and then washed his face and forearms and poured water over his head and washed his body. Then he shifted from that place and washed his feet. I brought a piece of cloth, but he did not take it and removed the traces of water from his body with his hand.&quot; (Bukhari no.274)<br /><br />The claim that 13 narrators who eventually narrate from Wa’il Ibn Hujr do not transmit narrations which are all agreement in wording, they differ themselves in what they narrate with some omitting certain aspects whilst others are detailed and other brief. Some of these narrations are weak in themselves, therefore to single out the narration of Mu’ammal from Sufyan is incorrect. Furthermore, Mu’ammal is below the chain compared to 8 who narrate directly from Asim bin Kulaib and some of them have narrated words to the affect that establish placing the hands on the chest for example Za’idah. <br /><br />Sometimes the claim is that Kulaib bin Shihab is alone in reporting these words while other do not report these from from Wa’il. At times all those who narrate from Wa’il do not even mention the fastening of the hands eg Abd al-Rahman bin al-Yahsabi (Musnad Ahmad 4:316), Hujr Abil al-Anbas al-Hadrami from Wail directly mentions nothing of the placing of the hands. (Abu Dawud 1:264), Alqamah from Wail where he mentions placing of the hands on each other, this is a very lengthy hadith with additional information (Muslim 2:301).<br /><br />Baihaqi (al-Khilafiyat (2:252) says Mu’ammal is alone in reporting from al-Thawri but he himself puts a chapter in his al-Sunan al-Kubra (2:30-31) on placing the hands on the chest and cites this very hadith of Mu’ammal <br /><br />Then people claim that Sufyan was alone in reporting it and the list of the claims is endless.</div>
