But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and do not become lazy upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.<br /><br />Translated by Abu Anas Atif Hasan<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://albinaapublishing.com/advice-during-the-time-in-which-trials-have-increased-people-of-innovation-have-spread-and-the-scholars-are-passing-away/">http://albinaapublishing.com/advice-dur ... sing-away/</a><!-- m --></div>
