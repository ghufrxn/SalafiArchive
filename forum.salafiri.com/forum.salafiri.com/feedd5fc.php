<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Directing the Student of Hadeeth on How to Open its Gate</span></strong><br /><em>by Muhammad ibn ash-Shaykh ‘Alee ibn Aadam al-Ityoobee</em><br /><br />Translated by Aboo Shaybah<br /><br />A few lines of poetry containing some general, but important, guidelines for a student to follow from the beginning stages of learning, as well as throughout the duration of study. (Taken from <em>al-Fawaa’id as-Samiyyah</em>, pg. 29)<br /><br />[1] My dear one, you must know that<br /><em>it is imperative in this discipline that you perfect it</em><br /><br />[2] by regularly attending the gatherings of those who have preserved the knowledge,<br /><em>respecting them, and without any disdain;</em><br /><br />[3] memorizing, understanding, and always observing Taqwaa,<br /><em>and maintaining humility towards every Muslim;</em><br /><br />[4] revising, while understanding, with those of sound guidance,<br /><em>avoiding those who are foolish and destructive.</em><br /><br />[5] If you find none to revise with, then you must continue<br /><em>poring over the statements of the well-versed scholars who preceded.</em><br /><br />[6] Indeed, anyone who has been blessed to peruse<br /><em>their words, with both memorization and comprehension</em><br /><br />[7] shall certainly have the gates opened for him<br /><em>by his Lord, who removes all barriers.</em><br /><br />[8] We ask You, O Allaah, to allow us<br /><em>to achieve our aspirations in this expansive field.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2017 11:32 pm</p><hr />
