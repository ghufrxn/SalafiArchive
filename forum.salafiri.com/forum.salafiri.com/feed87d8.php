<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Salafiyyah is not:</span></strong><br /><br />•Rushing towards Jarh (disparagement of an individual) without careful contemplation.<br /><br />•Following (a persons) mistakes.<br /><br />•Obligating people with that which isnt binding upon them.<br /><br />•Editing (someones) speech [i.e. not providing the full context].<br /><br />•Taking a persons speech upon a wrong understanding [meaning that one should understand a persons speech in a good way].<br /><br />•Eliminating each other due to information of those who are seen (subjectively) as &quot;trustworthy&quot;. <br /><br />•Blind-following of individuals.<br /><br />•Applying general rulings (of tabdee, takfeer, tafseeq etc*) upon specific individuals.<br /><br />•Quickly rushing to refute the mistake of a person or opponent before advising them.<br /><br />•Intiating rulings of tabdee, tafseeq, and takfeer without verification.<br /><br />•(Based on) conjecture and hastening to accept and spread every piece of information (about someone) without contemplating the (negative) outcome or consequences before giving a ruling.<br /><br />Allah the Most High says: &quot;And those who harm believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned, have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.&quot; -Quran 33:58.<br /><br />It is mentioned in a hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:<br /><br />&quot;Whoever says about a believer that which is not true, Allah will place him in the filth (of the people of the hellfire) up until he takes back what he said.&quot; <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">-[Musnad Ahmad 5385, Ibn Majah 3377...Sh.al-Albani authenticated it in Sahih at-Targheeb 2845].</span><br /><br />He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said:<br /><br />&quot;The most prevalent kind of riba (intrest) is going to lengths in speaking unjustly against a muslim's honour.&quot; <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">- [Abu Dawud 4876, sahih].</span><br /><br />So fear Allah, Oh students of knowledge,  do not become tools of destruction, dismantling the backbone of the Dawah, taking it away from its (true) path, and (in the process) splitting the ranks of the salafis into parties and new groups!<br /><br />(The above is taken from Sh.Saalih ibn Sa'd as-Suhaymis book: تنبيه ذوي الأفهام إلى رأب الصدع والوئام على منهج السلف الكرام page 14) <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">(*TN: Tabdee= is to declare someone an innovator.<br />Takfeer= is to declare someone a disbeliever.
