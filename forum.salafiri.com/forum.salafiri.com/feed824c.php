And from the matters that the hearts of the ones whispered (by Shaytaan) do not become perfumed, is Salah in shoes. And it is a Sunnah of Rasulullah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions, out of practise and order.<br /><br />As it is reported by Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), that Rasulullah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):<br /><br /><em>((Used to pray in his shoes))<br /><br />Agreed upon.</em><br /><br />And on the authority of Shaddad Ibn Aws, the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:<br /><br /><em>((Be different from the Jews, for verily they do not pray in their socks nor in their shoes.))<br /><br />Reported by Abu Dawud, Al-Haakim, At-Tabarani in Al-Kabir on the authority of Shaddad Ibn Aws and it’s chain is Hasan.</em><br /><br />And it was said to Imam Ahmed: ‘Does a man pray in his shoes?’ So he said: ‘Yes, by Allah’.<br />And you see the ones whispered (by Shaytaan), if one of them is tested with praying Salatul-Janaza in his shoes, he tip toes on the heels of his shoes as if he is standing on hot coal. And he ends up not praying in them!<br /><br /><strong><em>Translated by Hussain Suleman.</em></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">By Ibn Al-Qayyim<br />(Taken from his book: ‘Ighathatul Lahfaan min Masayid Ash Shaytaan’)</span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jan 02, 2017 9:46 pm</p><hr />
