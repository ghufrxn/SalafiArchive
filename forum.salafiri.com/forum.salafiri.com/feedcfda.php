<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Al-Qa'nabee (d. 221H) The Shaykh of Imaam Muslim: Whoever Does Not Affirm that ar-Rahmaan Ascended Over the Throne is a Jahmee</span></strong><br /><br />Banaan bin Ahmad said:<br /><br /><em>&quot;We were with Al-Qa'nabee (rahimahullaah) and he heard a man amongst the Jahmiyyah saying: &quot;ar-Rahmaan 'alal Arsh istawlaa&quot; (ar-Rahmaan conquered the Throne).&quot;</em><br /><br />So Al-Qa'nabee said:<br /><br /><em>&quot;Whoever does not hold with certain belief that ar-Rahmaan indeed ascended over the Throne as it occurs and is settled in the hearts of the generality (of the people) is a Jahmee.&quot;</em><br /><br />Abdul-Azeez al-Qaheetee related them both in his works.<br /><br />And the intent behind the &quot;generality (of the people)&quot;, is the generality of the people of knowledge, as we explained in the biography of Yazeed bin Haaroon, the Imaam of the people of Waasit. And Al-Qa'nabee was from the Imaams of guidance, until some of the Huffaadh exaggerated in him and made him superior to Maalik [bin Anas], the Imaam. He (Al-Qa'nabee) died in 221H at some eighty odd years of age, and he is the greatest of the Shaykhs of Muslim [the compiler of hadeeth], absolutely.<br /><br /><strong>Source</strong>: &quot;Mukhtasar al-Uluww&quot; of adh-Dhahabi (p. 178).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Sat Dec 03, 2016 10:30 pm</p><hr />
