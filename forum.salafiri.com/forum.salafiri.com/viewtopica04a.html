				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Daughters More Difficult To Raise Than Boys Today</span></strong><br /><em>Explained by Shaykh Fawzan</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Fawzan:</span></strong> The daughters today have become more difficult than the boys because they have started to go out to the schools, and go to the jobs and to the businesses. Therefore protect them when they go out.<br /><br />They should not go out while beautified. They should not go out uncovered. They should not go out unveiled and exposed. Regulate them with covering themselves, shyness and dignity.<br /><br />She should not ride alone with a driver who is not her close male relative (whom she is forbidden to marry) because this is the impermissible seclusion. And how much has occurred due to the girls being with drivers, who are not their close male relatives?! How much corruption and evil has occurred?!<br /><br />Therefore fear Allah O slaves of Allah. Protect your children—the males and females—because you will be questioned about them in front of Allah سُبحانه وتعالى . And their corruption is loss for you in this world and the hereafter. Thus fear Allah O slaves of Allah. Protect your offspring.<br /><br />I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">وَالَّذِيْنَ آمَنُوْا وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُمْ بِإِيْمَ انٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَا أَلَتْنَاهُمْ مِنْ عَمَلِهِم مِنْ شَيْء</span><br /><br /><em>And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything. (Soorah At Tur 52:21)</em><br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mtws.posthaven.com/">http://www.mtws.posthaven.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
