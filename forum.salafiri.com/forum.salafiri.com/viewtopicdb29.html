				<div class="content">Reference: Al-majmoo’ the biography of Allaamah Hammaad bin Muhammad Al-Ansaaree<em>[1]</em>, Volume 2, page 587 / 672-673 / 762<br /><br />With regards to <strong>Jamaatut-Tableegh</strong><em>[2]</em> then they have within them good and bad [characteristics]. In ‘Aqeedah they adhere to the heretic innovated beliefs of the Matureedeeyah<em>[3]</em>, and are bigoted blind-followers of the Hanafee<em>[4]</em> Madhab [in Fiqh].<br /><br />He also said: This group [Jamaatut-Tableegh] does not have an interest or zeal for [Islaamic] knowledge, nor do they seek [Islaamic knowledge]. Based upon this methodology, they cause more corruption and mischief [in the religion] than goodness and righteousness. I know [Jamaatut-Tableegh] very well. In Aqeedah they are Matureedee and Chishtis<em>[5]</em>, and in Fiqh they are bigoted blind followers of the Hanafee Madhab.<br /><br />He also said: The Salafees are the people of Sunnah and they are the Jama’ah, because Salafiyyah means to adhere and hold fast upon that which the pious predecessors were upon.<br /><br />He also said regarding them: Anybody that adheres to a view that contradicts and opposes the [way of the] people of Sunnah, then that person can not be regarded as being from amongst them. Therefore Ikhwaanul-Muslimeen<em>[6]</em> &amp; Jamaatut-Tableegh are not from Ahlus-Sunnah because their ideology contradicts and opposes the way of the people of Sunnah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes</strong><br /><br /><strong>[1]</strong> He is the Allamah Hammad bin Muhammad Alansaree As’sadee Alkhazrajee, born in the year 1343 or 1344 AH [1924 CE] in Mali, West Africa.

For a detailed biography of the Muhadeeth of Madeenah in English refer to: fatwa-online.com [TN]<br /><br /><strong>[2]</strong> Jamaatut-Tableegh is a group who ascribe themselves to the innovated ideology in calling to Islam of Muhammad Ilyas Deobandee Chisti [1885-1949 CE]. Muhammad Ilyas founded this group in the early 1920’s and adopted this idea from a man by the name of Saeed Annoorsee, nick-named as Badeeuz-Zamaan Annoorsee [1293-1379 AH] from Turkey. For a detailed history about this group and its beliefs refer to the following books:<br /><br />1. Alqawlul-Baleegh Fee Tahdeer min Jamaatet-Tableegh by Allamah Hamood Tuwaijaree;<br /><br />2. Asiraajul-Muneer Fee Tanbeeh Jamaatet-Tableegh Alaa Akhtaaehim by Allamah Dr Taqiudin Alhilali;<br /><br />3.

[TN]<br /><br /><strong>[3]</strong> Matureedeeyah: a heretic sect in Aqeedah that opposes the methodology of the pious predecessors particularly in understanding the Names &amp; Attributes of Allaah the Most Exalted and many other issues pertaining to Aqeedah. Its founder was Abu Mansoor, Muhammad bin Mahmood bin Muhammad Almatureedee, Asamarqandee Alhanafee born in the year 238 or 258 AH and died on 333 AH. [Almatureedeeyah Volume 1 page 212-213.] For a detailed refutation on this heretic sect, their history and beliefs refer to the outstanding refutation of Allamah Shams Asalafee Alafghani known as ‘Almatureedeeyah’. [TN]<br /><br /><strong>[4]</strong> Blind-followers of Numan bin Thabit bin Alkhazaz Alkufi (80-150 A.H), famously known as Abu Haneefah in the application of the subsidiary issues of the Shariah [Fiqh] [TN].<br /><br /><strong>[5]</strong> Ascription to the Chishti Sufi order. This order was founded by a man by the name of Khawja Abu Ishaq Shami [d. 941 AH] who brought Sufism to the town of Chist, 95 miles east of Herat in present day Afghanistan. The most famous of the Sufis in the Chisti order is Khawja Moinuddin Chishti who was born 536 AH/1141 CE in Sajistan, Khorasan in Persia. He travelled to India and was the first person to introduce Sufism in India. He settled in the city of Ajmer, India where he died on 627 AH/1230 CE. His tomb has become the central place of grave worshipping worshipped by ignorant Muslims, Hindus, soothsayers, and magicians etc. Jamaatut-Tableegh ascribe themselves to this man and his heretic beliefs. For his detailed biography refer to ‘Nuzhatul-Khawaatir’ Volume 1 page 104.
