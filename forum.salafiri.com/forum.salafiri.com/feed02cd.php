<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Not Raising the Hands to Supplicate After the Obligatory Prayer</span></strong><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /> <br />‘The people of knowledge explained that it is not legislated to raise the hands in Dua’ after completing the obligatory prayer, and that it opposes the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.<br /> <br />Ibn al-Haaj -Rahimullaah- said:<br />‘It has not been mentioned that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had completed the prayer and given Tasleem, that he raised his hands and supplicated, and that the people said Ameen to his Dua’. Nor was it mentioned regarding the Khulafah Rashideen after the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor from the rest of the Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum. Therefore, something which the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did not do, nor any one of his Companions then there is no doubt that leaving that action is better than doing it, rather this action is a Bida’. . . .’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[al-Mudkhal 2/276]</span></strong> <br />  <br />It has been mentioned in the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Fatawa of the Lajnah ad-Daimah for research of knowledge and verdicts’</span></strong>:<br />‘Making Dua’ after the obligatory prayer is not from the Sunnah if it is done while raising the hands. This is whether it is done by the Imam alone or just those who had prayed behind him, or the Imam and the people together. Rather this is a Bida’, because it has not been conveyed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- nor from his Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum-.<br /> <br />As for Dua’ without raising the hands, then that is okay due to some Ahadeeth mentioned regarding that.’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[‘Fatawa Lajnah’ 7/103]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz -Rahimullaah- said: ‘As far as we know it has not been reported from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- nor from his Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum- that they used to raise their hands to make Dua’ after the obligatory prayer. So it is known to be a Bida’ due to the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:<br /> <br />‘He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected.’ Collected by Muslim in his Saheeh.<br /> <br />As for making Dua’ without raising the hands and without doing it in congregation then there is no problem with doing that, because what has been affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that which indicates that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- supplicated before the Salam [at the end of the prayer] and after it.<br /> <br />Similar to this is making Dua’ after the optional prayer, due to the absence of any indication that it is allowed –regardless of whether or not the hands are raised, as raising the hands in Dua’ is a means for that Dua’ being answered. However, this should not be done regularly, rather from time to time, because it is not affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to make Dua’ raising his hands after every optional prayer. All good is in taking the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- as an example and following his methodology due to the saying of Allaah –Subhanahu:<br /> <br />&quot;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow&quot;  <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqalaat Mutnawa’ah (11/168)]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- said: ‘It is not affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he used to raise his hands after the prayer if he made Dua’. . . .’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Silsilah Ahadeeth Da’eefah wal Mawdoo’ah 6/60]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.) said: ‘My instruction to the one who supplicates to Allaah Ta’ala after every obligatory prayer while raising his hands, is to leave that practice and to follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and to adhere to his guidance. Indeed the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Majmoo Fatawa wa Ras’ail 13/281]</span></strong><br /> <br />[From: ‘al-Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah wal-Mawdoo’ah alati Yastadil biha ala Bida’ fel Ibadaat’ 1/450]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 12:51 am</p><hr />
