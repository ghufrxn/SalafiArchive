			<div class="content">This is Suroorism so Beware of it!<br /><br />AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee<br /><br />SOURCE: His book Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb ‘alaa As’ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 179-185)<br /><br />PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com<br /><br />Question: What is Suroorism and what are its clear signs. Is it real or just part of one’s imagination?<br /><br />Answer: All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah – alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. To proceed:<br /><br />Suroorism is an ascription to the brother Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen. He used to be in Kuwait where he came out with some good books in which he clarified the beliefs of the Shee’ah, as well as other good books. Then he moved to Germany and then to England where he eventually settled. There, he produced the Magazine entitled “Al-Bayaan” and we were extremely pleased with it. Then he produced another magazine called “As-Sunnah” and likewise we were extremely pleased with it. And we said: “This is the answer to what we have been waiting for.” And some of our brothers praised the magazine “Al-Bayaan” and even we praised it in the past, saying: “There cannot be found anything equal to it.” However the condition of the Hizbees is that in the beginning they call to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah until the people’s hearts grow attached to them and their strength increases. Then when they come to know that criticism against them will have no effect on them, they manifest what they are truly upon.<br /><br />The magazine “As-Sunnah”, of which it is more proper that it be called “Al-Bid’ah” calls people away from the scholars and it accuses them of being inactive, paid by the government and not having an understanding of current affairs.<br /><br />But all praise be to Allaah, the reality of the Surooris came out in the open during the Gulf Crisis. This was from the Grace of Allaah, ‘azza wa jall. I remember reading at that time some words (in their magazine) in which there was an attack against Shaikh Al-Albaanee for having produced a tape called: “An Encounter with a Suroori.” Then a few pages later they praised Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So I realized the significance of this praise – so that it won’t be said that: “They attack the scholars!”<br /><br />Some days after the fatwa of Shaikh Ibn Baaz concerning the permissibility of making a treaty with the Jews was issued, they launched an attack against Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So it was in fact a well-devised scheme to chase the people away from the scholars! And the magazines “Al-Bayaan” and “As-Sunnah” gave the understanding that it was more proper to refer to those Salafees who understood the current affairs in Yemen concerning the affair of the Yemeni Crisis.<br /><br />So I say: O you masaakeen [1]…who is it that is unaware of the condition of the Muslims? Rather, all of the matter lies in fixing this current situation we find ourselves in.<br /><br />So what has befallen the Muslims from losses, fear and suffering, then it is due to our sins. Allaah says: “Allaah puts forth the example of a town (Makkah) that dwelt in security and well-being; it’s provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it denied the Blessings of Allaah. So Allaah made them taste the extreme hunger (famine) and fear because of what they used to do.” [Surah An-Nahl: 112]<br /><br />So if we have come to realize the sickness, then what is the cure? Allaah says: “Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy (i.e. Khilaafah) in the land as he granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me.” [Surah An-Noor: 55]<br /><br />So it is the sins that have brought humiliation upon the Muslims. And it is their dealing with interest, their allowing of fornication in many of the Islamic lands and their preferring and submitting to man-made laws brought by way of the enemies of Islaam, and how much more can we list…and the going out without Hijaab and indecent exposure, and their mixing of the sexes in the schools and the universities.<br /><br />So the cure is in returning to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, and then by returning to the scholars. Allaah says: “And when there came to them a matter concerning (public) security or fear, they announced it to the people. But if only they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those encharged with authority amongst them, those who have the ability to derive a proper conclusion from it would have understood it.”[Surah An-Nisaa: 83]<br /><br />So it is an obligation on us to return to the scholars: “These are the parables that We send forth to the people, yet no one (truly) understands them except those with knowledge.” [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 43]<br /><br />But what you see is a person memorizing three or four subjects and then he takes that around to the masaajid, charging and ramming (like a bull). Then his companions nickname him Shaikh-ul-Islaam! So is this knowledge? Rather, knowledge is sitting upon a mat with your needs tucked below you (hearing from a shaikh) – enduring with patience the hardships of hunger and bareness. Just look at the condition of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and what they went through.<br /><br />And the people of knowledge, they are the ones who put each thing in it’s proper place, as was stated in the previous ayah. And Allaah says: “Verily, in that is a reminder to those who possess knowledge.” [Surah Ar-Room: 22]<br /><br />And Allaah says: “Is the one who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth then like he who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.” [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 19]<br /><br />The affliction that the Muslims are being tested by is their being ignorant about their Religion. So anyone that memorizes some ayaat and ahaadeeth and then begins to talk about it, especially if he has some eloquence in speech, people say: “This is a Shaikh.”<br /><br />All praise be to Allaah, the reality of the matter became clear, as it is said:<br /><br />“If you hear the eloquent one speaking, do not give yourself into him<br />For this unnatural (way of speaking) is something artificial<br />Be pleased with taking knowledge and understanding, and<br />His eloquent speech will come to an end without any fight.”<br /><br />And Allaah says when informing us of the story of Qaaroon: “So he (Qaaroon) went forth before his people in his arrogance. Those who are desirous of the life of this world said: ‘Ah, would that we had the like of what Qaaroon has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.’ But those who had been given knowledge said: ‘Woe to you! The reward of Allaah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient. So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allaah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. And those who had desired to have been in his position the day before, began to say: ‘Know you not that it is Allaah who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allaah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)!’ Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful?’” [Surah Al-Qasas: 79-82]<br /><br />So it is an obligation on us to return to the people of knowledge and to learn, just as when Jibreel went to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) to teach the Companions how to ask questions.<br /><br />And I will never forget what ‘Abdul-Qaadir Ash-Shaybaanee, the small ignoramus, said: “We will send some of our brothers to Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (i.e. Shaikh Muqbil) to get some gulps (of knowledge) in two months, and then we will send them to some of the centers to take over grounds from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen.” So I said: “In two months it’s possible to produce callers to Allaah?”<br /><br />So if it is the ignorant ones that are in charge of directing the Da’wah groups, then I give the tidings of the demise of such Da’wah groups. So we must gather with the scholars and take knowledge from them, as our scholars in the past did. Salmaan Al-Faarisee sat and sought knowledge with the first scholar he encountered until he died, and then a second and a third until he came upon the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and followed him. And this is how the companions of Mu’aadh (raa) were. Before he passed away, they said to him: “Who shall we go to (for knowledge after you)?” He said: “To ‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas’ood.”<br /><br />And when one of the brothers demands one of the Hizbees to seek knowledge, he says: “Amongst you are those who want this world and amongst you are those who want the Hereafter.”[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152] And then he says: “Allaah said this ayah with regard to the Companions” – meaning, they acknowledge that they have no patience in seeking knowledge and in suffering hunger. They prefer to live close to people in buildings and cars and in the worldly life.<br /><br />Then we hear them say: “You attack the different organizations.” So who told you that we attack the organizations? Yes, we attack some of the organizations that consist of partisanship, restricted Walaa (loyalty), thievery and misappropriation of money. These are the kinds of groups that we criticize and call the people away from.<br /><br />So this is a Da’wah (call) that is based on lies and deceptions, but the reality will become manifest. For the Da’wah of ‘Alee Ibn Al-Fadl manifested itself and the reality of the Da’wah of the Mu’tazilah, the Shee’ah and Sufis manifested themselves. And the ones who will expose and make these realities manifest, by the Permission of Allaah, are Ahlus-Sunnah.<br /><br />And all praise be to Allaah, Ahlus-Sunnah are the ones who always examine and rectify the Muslim ummah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “There will not cease to be a group from my ummah that is triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them until Allaah’s Command (i.e. Promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).”<br /><br />So Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him, in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd, is exposing the Hizbees and clarifying what beliefs they are upon. And likewise Shaikh Abul-Hasan in Ma’ribi[2] and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab in Hudaydah and Shaikh Muhammad Al-Imaam in Ma’bar and Shaikh Qaasim and the brother Muhammad As-Somalee in Jaami’-ul-Khair in San’aa.<br /><br />So I advise the brothers, because many of them all praise be to Allaah are receptive, to return to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and to call to them, and to not waste away their lives in glorifying Shaikh so and so. And if they were to abandon such sheikhs, they would say: “Beware of him, he is from Jamaa’at At-Takfeer” or “He is a government agent.” These are words of one who doesn’t fear Allaah.<br /><br />Footnotes:<br /><br />[1] Translator’s Note: This is the plural of the Arabic word miskeen, which means someone needy. In this context it refers to someone who is ignorant and lacking knowledge, thus being needy (of it).<br /><br />[2] Translator’s Note: It is important to note that this article appeared in the first edition (printed in the year 2000) of the book “Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb”. Since then, and after the passing away of Imaam Muqbil Al-Waadi’ee, the scholars have become aware of errors in creed and manhaj committed on the part of Abul-Hasan Al-Ma’ribee. So the likes of Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee, Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee and Shaikh ‘Ubayd Al-Jabiree refuted him and warned against him.<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/29/this-is-suroorism-so-beware-of-it-shaykh-muqbil-bin-haadee/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/29/t ... in-haadee/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/suroorism/">http://www.salafiri.com/suroorism/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.</div>
