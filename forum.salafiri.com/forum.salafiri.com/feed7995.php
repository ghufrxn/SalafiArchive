<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Serving From Your Right Hand Side</span></strong><br /><em>By the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</em><br /><br /><em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’<br /><br />Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">No. 1771</span></strong> – From Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was brought some milk that was blended with water and on his right was a Bedouin and on his left was Abu Bakr, so he drank from it then he gave it to the Bedouin and said:<br /><br />‘On the right on the right.’<br /><br />And in another narration: ‘those on the right, those on the right, you should give it on the right hand side.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">No. 1771</span></strong><br /><br />[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood]<br /><br />Shaykh Albaani said:<br /><br />‘In this hadeeth, the one who was serving the drinks began with the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- because the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was the one who requested a drink. Therefore, it is not correct to use this hadeeth as an evidence to prove that the Sunnah is to essentially begin with the eldest of the people as is widespread nowadays.<br /><br />How can this be the case when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- himself did not do this, on the contrary the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave the drink to the Bedouin who was on his right hand side and not to Abu Bakr who was on his left hand side, then the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- explained by saying: ‘On the right hand side then the next one after him.’<br /><br />[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah by Shaykh al-Albaani (No.1771)]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/serving-from-your-right-hand-side/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... hand-side/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 02, 2017 12:09 am</p><hr />
