Is it a hizb (group)? And what is the ruling of ascribing [oneself] to it?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Sãlih al-Fawzãn may Allah preserve him replies</span></strong>, “Salafiyyah is the origin. [It is] the methodology of the Pious Predecessors from the Mahājireen and the Ansār and those who followed them in goodness. This is the origin. Who ever opposes and leaves it, he is misguided. This Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hell-Fire except one. They [the Companions] said, “Who are they?” He (ﷺ) said,<br /><br /><em>((Those who are upon what I am upon today and my Companions.))</em><br /><br />This is Salafiyyah. [It is] what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions were upon including those Imāms that came after them. This is Salafiyyah. It is not as they say that Salafiyyah is a sect from among the sects. No! It is the origin. The sects are those who have split off from it.”<br /><br />Translated by Ismaeel Beaumont<br />Al Madinah an-Nabawwiyyah<br />The Prophet’s City (ﷺ)<br />19th Jumāda al-Awwal, 1436<br />Tuesday 10th March 2015</div>
