<title type="html"><![CDATA[(4) Why We Must Never Taint Dawah Salafiyyah]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=88&amp;p=92#p92"><![CDATA[
Ubayy ibn Ka’b (radi Allāhu ’anhu) stated:<br /><br />“You must follow the path of Allāh and the Sunnah. There is no slave who is on the path of Allāh and the Sunnah, remembering Allāh, his eyes overflowing out of fear of his Lord, but that Allāh will never punish him. A minimal course in the path of Allāh and the Sunnah is better than striving hard in a path contrary to the path of Allāh and the Sunnah and consenting to innovation.” (Usool ul Eemaan Fee Dau Kitaab was Sunnah pg. 296)<br /><br />Praise be to Allah, we call to a middle path, not being too harsh and nor being overly lenient and apologetic.<br /><br />Consider the words of the illustrious companion Ubayy, the first part is emphatic in stating that the Sunni, Salafee who is merely an aami {layperson} but he is established firmly upon the book and Sunnah, that is as Salafiyyah, then “Allah will never punish him”. Praise be to Allah, let us call the general masses to this Salafiyyah and let us not be shy. We may well be held accountable for not allowing the general masses to be introduced to the clear and untainted salafiyyah. This is the job of the caller.<br /><br />The second part of his saying clarifies further that as callers if we cannot give the people true and pure Dawah Salafiyyah then we should NEVER allow an untainted, twisted and confused version promoted by those who bring the grave worshipper and other than that under Ahlus Sunnah to emanate from our platforms or masaajid! It is better for us that we sit at home and better ourselves and our families then to preach or stay silent, thus accepting, the mistakes of others in the deen. Allahs aid is sought.<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not-differ-la-tafarraqu/">http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not- ... tafarraqu/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 12:47 am</p><hr />
