<span style="font-size: 125%; line-height: normal">بـسـم الله والحـمـد لله والـصلاة والـسـلام عــلى رسـول الله، وبـعـد<br /><br /><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee رحمه ﷲ said:</strong><br /><br />The foundations of Bid`ah are four:<br /><br /> <strong>First:</strong><br />(Following) the Weak Ahaadeeth, which can neither be relied upon nor permissible to be attributed to the Prophet ﷺ. So, it is not permissible to follow/implement such narrations, as we have mentioned in the introduction of the book: &quot;صفة الصلاة النبي&quot; (Description of the Prophet's prayer). And this is what a group of scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and others follow.<br /><br /> <strong>Second:</strong><br />Following fabricated Ahaadeeth, or those narrations which have no basis, the unauthenticity of which was hidden from some of the Fuqahaa' (jurists), and on the basis of which they made some of their rulings. It is from the worst type of Bid`ah and newly invented matters.<br /><br /> <strong>Third:</strong><br />Giving judgments and forming opinions by some of the Fuqahaa' - especially by those of the latter times - without having any Shar`ee (legislated) evidence (from the Kitaab and the Sunnah). But rather they are based on assumptions, (and they become so widespread) until they are assumed to be established Sunnah, and implemented by the people. But it is not hidden from the one who has an insight of his religion, that it is not permissible to follow such acts which are not legislated.<br /><br /> <strong>Fourth:</strong><br />Habits and superstitions which have no proof in the Sharee`ah, nor any logical basis.<br /><br /> One should know that not all Bid`aat are of the same level. Rather, they have different levels; some are Shirk, some are clear Kufr, and some are less than that.<br /><br /> One should also know that even the smallest Bid`ah which a person does in the religion, it becomes Haraam (sinful, having no excuse) after it has been established for him that it is a Bid`ah.<br /><br /> There is nothing regarding Bid`ah which can be considered as something &quot;disliked&quot; - like how some people think. How can they claim this when the Prophet ﷺ said: <span style="color: #000080"><strong>❝The most evil of affairs are those that are newly invented, and every newly-invented thing is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.❞</strong></span> [Sunan al-Nasaee (1578)and graded as &quot;Saheeh&quot; by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br /> And the best and most comprehensive research work on this was done by Imaam al-Shaatibee, in his book, &quot;al-I`tesaam&quot;.<br /><br /> Bid`ah in religion is a very dangerous affair, but many people are ignorant about this. And no one knows about its severity except for a small group of people who have been given knowledge. Sufficient is the following Hadeeth as evidence about the danger of falling into Bid`ah, the Prophet ﷺ said: <span style="color: #000080"><strong>❝Allaah does not accept the repentance of an innovator until he abandons his innovation.❞</strong></span>  [al-Saheehah (1620) and graded as &quot;Saheeh&quot; by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br /><strong> [Hajjatun-Nabiy by Shaikh al-Albaanee (1/101-103)]</strong></span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46440">AbuDahlia</a> — Tue Jun 16, 2020 4:49 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Good innovations?</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Hadith: Every innovation is misguidance.</span></strong><br /><br />Seriousness of innovation: This is like claiming that Rasoolullah ﷺ did not provide the complete religion to us or what we have introduced is better than what he gave to us.<br /><br />Apparently contradicting statements by Umar and Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنهم) praising some innovations as good are quoted by those in favour of introducing innovations in Islam.<br /><br />Umar (رضي الله عنه): What a good innovation this is! (In reference to Taraweeh prayer).<br /><br />Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه): Bid'ah (innovation) and what a good bid'ah (In reference to Duhaa prayer)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Does this mean that there is an exception to the Hadith quoted earlier and some innovations are indeed good?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> The two statements (which are the only 'evidences' available to innovators) by Umar and Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنهم) do not approve of innovations at all. Before going into these two statements, we must understand some of the types of Sunnah:<br /><br /><ul>1 - Direct actions, orders, recommendations and instructions of Rasoolullah ﷺ<br />2 - Actions of Rasoolullah ﷺ but not ordered or instructed to others<br />3 - Actions of the people not disapproved, disliked or rejected by Rasoolullah ﷺ.</ul><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">Now coming to the two statements...</span></em><br />First statement) Taraweeh was prayed by Rasoolullah ﷺ at home. He came to the Masjid for three nights and did not do so afterwards as he feared that it would become mandatory rather than Sunnah [Saheeh Muslim, book 4, Hadith no. 1,663]. When Taraweeh was revived as a congregational prayer, Umar (رضي الله عنه) was definitely aware of the practice and statement of Rasoolullah ﷺ when he said 'What a good bidah this is!' Had it been an innovation in his view (which it was not), he would have not used such words. Therefore, he said this in a linguistic term and not in religious term and meant that it was a revival which had a basis in the Sunnah.<br /><br />Second statement) Some people were praying Duhaa prayer and Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) said to them 'what a good bid'ah'. Some facts need to be mentioned here.<br /><br /><ul>- Duhaa prayer was Sunnah: “It is preferable to offer Duha prayer when the sun’s heat has become so intense that even the young of the camels feel it.” [Muslim, 748]<br /><br />- Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) himself used to pray this prayer occasionally: Narrated Nafi': Ibn 'Umar never offered the Duha prayer except on two occasions: [Saheeh Bukhari, book #21, Hadith #283]<br /><br />- Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) did not know whether Rasoolullah ﷺ prayed Duhaa or not: &quot;Did the Prophet use to pray it?&quot; Ibn 'Umar replied, &quot;I don't think he did.&quot; [Saheeh Bukhari, book #21, Hadith #271]</ul><br />If Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) himself occasionally prayed Duhaa and he did not know whether Rasoolullah ﷺ prayed or not, then there can be two possibilities here:<br /><br /><ul>1) The Hadith of Duhaa prayer reached him - Then in his view, it would have been the first category of Sunnah stated above.<br /><br />2) The Hadith did not reach him - Then in his view, it would have been the third category of Sunnah i.e people practiced and the action had implied approval of Rasoolullah ﷺ as he did not condemn it.</ul><br />So when he called this prayer as a good Bid'ah, he referred to it either linguistically i.e. a good revival of Sunnah (first possibility) or he meant that this was an act started by the people (Bid'ah) but Rasoolullah ﷺ implied approved it (Hasanah) and hence the term good innovation. This is further confirmed by the following Hadith:<br /><br />Narrated 'Aisha: I never saw the Prophet offering the duha prayer but I always offer it. (Saheeh Bukhari, book #21, Hadith #273)<br /><br />The claim that Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) considered some innovations as good is refuted by himself: He (رضي الله عنه) said: Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people see it as something good.&quot; [Kitab al Sunnah pg. 24 Hadith 82, Sharh Asul Aiteqaad Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamah Hadith 126, al Mudakhal Bayhqi Hadith 191].<br /><br />Indeed, Allah knows best.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 1:10 pm</p><hr />

A very serious and yet simple reason to abstain and warning against innovations,<br /><br />Allah says in the Quran <br /><br /><strong>&quot;On the Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces will turn black.&quot; (Surah Aal-Imran:106)</strong><br /><br />The mufassir of the Quran, about whom our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm) supplicated to Allah for him to teach Abdullah Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) the Quran (Bukhari) said about this ayah<br /><br />Ibn Abbas who died in 68H said in explanation of this ayah,<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><em>&quot;The white faces refers to Ahlus Sunnah and the black faces refers to Ahlul Bidah.&quot; (Zad al-Masir Fi Ilm at-Tafsir(1/436) of Ibn al-Jawzi, Mau'alim at-Tanzil (1/339) of Baghawi and Qurtubi (4/167) who all narrated it in marfu form</em><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />There is however some weakness in the chain, However it is supported by a narration Imam Lalikai transmits with addition words in is Sharh Usul (1/72). the addition words are, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamah and Ahlul Bidah Wad-Dalalah ie misguidance.<br /><br />Imam Lalikai also brings another report from Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in support of the first report (1/55) however this is also weak. Yet all three support each other as there is weakness in the chain based on memory.<br /><br />Bidah lead to distancing one self from the Quran and Sunnah, opposing the way of the Companions and Salaf and lastly developing pride and arrogance which leads to rejecting the truth.<br /><br />This is very evident from the people around us in our times. We pray Allah that Allah helps us to stay away from bidah and its people so that our faces are not black on the yaum al-Qiyamah.

<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Chapter One: Definition of Bida’</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Linguistic meaning:</em><br /><br />‘It is something which is invented without a preceding example.’[1]<br /><br /><em>Sharee’a Definition:</em><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah defined it as:<br /><br />‘Al-Bida’ in the Deen: is that which Allaah and His Messenger have not legislated, and it is that which has not been commanded, neither as an obligatory command nor as one, which is preferred (or recommended.)’[2]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Chapter Two: Evidences that prove there is no good in Bida’</span></strong><br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala says:<br /><br /><ul>اليوم أكملت لكم دينكم وأتممت عليكم نعمتي و رضيت لكم بالإسلام دينا</ul><br /><ul>&lt;&lt;This day I have perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&gt;&gt;[3]</ul><br />Maalik bin Anas[4] said, ‘Whoever innovates in Islaam a Bida’, and regards it as good. Then he has alleged that Muhammad صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ was disloyal in delivering the message, because Allaah said: This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion. That, which was not considered Deen[5] at that time, is not considered Deen today.[6]<br /><br />Ash-Shawkaanee[7] said: ‘If Allaah has indeed perfected His Deen before taking His Prophet away, then what is this opinion, which its people (i.e. the people of innovations) introduce after Allaah has completed His Deen!’<br /><br />If Bida’ was considered a part of the Deen as it is according to the Aqeedah of those who innovate.[8] Then this shows us clearly, that in their opinion, the Deen is not complete thus refuting the Noble Qur’aan. If however it is not from the Deen then what is the benefit of concerning themselves with something that is not from the Deen?!<br /><br />This is a strong proof, and great evidence, it is not possible for the person who follows his own opinion to reject this. So, make this noble verse the first that you strike in the face of the people of opinions, to defy them and to refute their arguments.[9]<br /><br />(2) It is narrated from Jaabir bin Abdullaah[10] – May Allaah be pleased with him – that the Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ used to say in his Khutbah.<br /><br />‘To proceed, Indeed the best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad  صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ, and the worst of affairs are the introduced matters, every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.’[11]<br /><br />(3) ‘Irbaad bin Sariyaah[12] – May Allaah be pleased with him – narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ admonished us, and his admonishment caused our hearts to tremble, and our eyes to overflow with tears, so we said: O Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ it is as though this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said:<br /><br />‘I advise you to fear Allaah, hear and obey, even if the one in command is a slave, and he who lives amongst you will witness many differences, so hold fast to my Sunnah[13], and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs, bite onto it with your molar teeth, and beware of newly invented matters for verily all Bida’ is misguidance.’[14]<br /><br />Ibn Rajab[15]said:<br /><br />As for the saying of the Messenger of Allaah  صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ then this is from his eloquent speech, for which there is no exception, and this is one of the great principles from the fundamentals of the Deen.[16]<br /><br />Ibn Hajar[17] said:<br /><br />His saying ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ regarding its definition, then it is a complete Islaamic principle according to the Sharee’a,[18] and according to its understanding.  Thus in relation to its text, it is as though one is saying, that the ruling of such and such is an act of Bida’, and all Bida’ is misguidance, so it cannot be from the Sharee’a, because all the Sharee’a is guidance.  If it is established that the mentioned ruling is Bida’ then what has proceeded is correct and the goal has been achieved.[19]<br /><br />The esteemed scholar of our time Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih ‘Uthaimeen[20] said:<br /><br />‘Verily his saying ‘All Bida’ encompasses all generality and completeness, for the word ‘ كل‘ (all) kullu, has been used with the strongest meaning which emphasises generality and completeness.’<br /><br />He also added, ‘so regarding everything that is claimed to be a Bida’ hassanah’,  the reply to this is that, there is no scope for the people of Bida’ for them to turn their Bida’ into  Bida’ hassanah’, because we grasp in our hands this sharpened sword of the Messenger of Allaah ( with the words) ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’.[21]<br /><br />(4)Ayesha[22] – May Allaah be pleased with her –  narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ said:<br /><br />‘Whoever innovates in this affair (religion) of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected.’[23]<br /><br />Ash-Shawkaanee said: This hadeeth is from the principles of the Deen, for it is an embodiment of rulings that have no limit.  Falsehood becomes apparent when some jurists divide Bida’ into two categories, and subject this rejection (as mentioned in the hadeeth) to some Bida’ and not to others, without logical reasoning or evidence.[24]<br /><br />(5) Abd’Allaah bin Ukeem[25] – May Allaah be pleased with him – narrated that Umar[26] – May Allaah be pleased with him – said: Indeed the most truthful of what has been said, is the saying of the Messenger of Allaah, “……and indeed the best of guidance is the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah, and indeed the most evil of the affairs is innovation, is it not so that all Bida’ is misguidance and all misguidance is in the fire.”[27]<br /><br />Abd’Allaah bin Masood[28] – May Allaah be pleased with him – said: ‘Follow and do not innovate, for indeed the Deen is sufficient for you and all Bida’ is misguidance.’[29]<br /><br />AbdAllaah bin Umar[30] – May Allaah be pleased with him – said: All Bida’ is misguidance, even if the people regard it as good.[31]<br /><br />‘Alee – May Allaah be pleased with him –  said: If the religion was based upon intellect then the bottom of the foot would be wiped rather than the top, for verily I saw the Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ wipe the top of his khuffs.[32]<br /><br />Umar bin Khattab – May Allaah be pleased with him said as he kissed the black stone : Verily I know that you are a stone, you do not cause benefit nor harm, and if I had not see the Messenger of Allaah صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ kissing you, I would not have kissed you.[33]<br /><br />These Salafee[34] narrations from the noble Companions make clear the correct methodology in understanding and implementing the Sharee’a. And show that there is no scope for the intellect to decipher that which is good in it, nor to adorn it with their own opinions. The place of all this correct methodology in comprehending the Sharee’a is found in the texts of the Sharee’a.<br /><br />Therefore that which is considered good is only that which is considered good by the Sharee’a itself, and that which is considered bad is only that which is bad in accordance to the Sharee’a, thus the intellect in itself cannot regard anything as good or bad, however  the people of misguidance oppose this statement of ours.<br /><br />Abu Shama Maq’dasee said in his book, ‘al-Ba’ith:<br /><br />‘It is obligatory upon the scholar when faced with situations, and when asked about the Sharee’a: that he returns to the evidence which is found in the Book of Allaah which was sent down, and that which is authentic from His Prophet, the truthful Messenger صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ, and that which his Companions were upon, and those who came after them from the early generations. So, that which conforms to what they were upon, is what the scholar has to allow and command us with, and whatever opposes what the early generations were upon then he has to prohibit it and prevent us from it. In doing so he has believed and followed.[35]<br />[1] See ‘Lisan al-Arab’ by Ibn Manthoor 9/351.<br /><br />[2] Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 4/107.<br /><br />[3]Soorah Mai’da : 3<br /><br />[4] Maalik ibn Anas ibn Aamir was born in Madeenah in 93 A.H. &amp; died in 179 A.H.

He was from amongst the ahl-ul-Suffah, Utbah bin Ubaid would say that ‘Irbaad is better than me and vice versa.<br /><br />[13]In the broadest sense it means the entire Deen, which the Prophet came with &amp; taught, i.e. beliefs, rulings, manners, actions which were conveyed by the Companions, and in the other sense it means the sayings and the actions of the Prophet and those things which he allowed, &amp; his behaviour.<br /><br />The Prophet said: ‘He who turns away from my Sunnah is not from me.’ Bukharee &amp; Muslim.<br /><br />[14]Narrated by Ahmad (4/126), Abu Dawood 4607, at-Tirmidhee 2676 and he said it was Hasan Saheeh, &amp; Ibn Majah 44 &amp; ad-Darimee (1/44-45), al-Bazaar said : hadeeth thabit saheeh.

He was a great scholar of Hadeeth, he was given the title of ameer ul-mumineen of Hadeeth in his time.  Ibn Fahad said : ‘Eyes have not seen one like him and he hasn’t seen anyone like him self.’  He used to follow and stick to the Sunnah very firmly in all his affairs. He used to call to the Sunnah with his speech &amp; his writings, he used to warn against opposing it and was severe in his disapproval of Bida’.  He wrote a very famous explanation of the Saheeh of al-Bukharee, called Fath-ul-Bari.<br /><br />[18]Divine code of law.<br /><br />[19]Fath-ul-Baree 13/254.<br /><br />[20]He is Abu Abdillaah Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn Uthaimeen al-Wahabee at-Tameemee.

She died 59 a.h.  On the 17th Ramadan, Abu Huraira -may Allaah be pleased with him- buried her.<br /><br />She was the Mother of the Believers, as-Siddeqqah.  Umar – may Allaah be pleased with him – asked the Messenger of Allaah, ‘who is the most beloved of people to you?’ he replied: ‘Ayesha’, then he asked, ‘from amongst the men?’ he replied: ‘Her father.’<br /><br />Ash-Shaabee said : when Masrooq would narrate on Ayesha to us, he would say : ‘I was told by the truthful one, daughter of the truthful one, the beloved of the most beloved to Allaah, who’s innocence was established from above the seven heavens.’<br /><br />Az-Zuhri said : ‘If the knowledge of Ayesha was gathered against the knowledge of all the other wives of the Messenger of Allaah and all the women, then Ayesha’s knowledge would remain unsurpassed.’<br /><br />[23]Saheeh al-Bukharee &amp; Muslim.<br /><br />[24]Nail –awtaar 2/69.<br /><br />[25]He was a Companion of the Messenger of Allaah but he did not narrate from him.  His name is Abdullaah bin Ukeem Abu Ma’baad al-Koofi, he died during the rule of Hajjaj.  He was around from before the time of Islaam.<br /><br />[26] He was the second of the great Khulafa of the Messenger of Allaah, Abu Hafs, Umar bin al-Khattab bin Nufail.  He died in the year 23 a.h. after leading the Fajr prayer, he was stabbed whilst leading the prayer.  His khilaafah lasted for 10yrs after the khilaafah of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, the Messenger of Allaah was always seen with Abu Bakr &amp; Umar.<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘Verily Allaah has placed the truth upon the tongue &amp; heart of Umar.’ Narrated by  Ibn Umar &amp; Abu Dharr, collected by Ahmad, Tirmidhee, Abu Dawood &amp; authenticated by al-Albaanee in saheeh al-Jaami’.<br /><br />Talha bin Ubaidullaah said: That Umar was not the first to embrace Islaam nor to make Hijraa but was the foremost in zuhud &amp; desiring for the hereafter out of us.<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah mentions as is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukharee by Jabir bin Abdullaah : ‘I saw myself entering Paradise, and behold! I saw ar-Rumaisa the wife of Abu Talha.  And I heard footsteps, so I asked who’s that? It was said: It is Bilal.  Then I saw a palace with a lady sitting in its courtyard. So I said who’s is this? They said it is Umar’s.  I wanted to enter it and see it then I remembered your Ghira.’ Then Umar said: Let my parents be sacrificed for you O Allaah’s Messenger how dare I think of my Ghira being offended by you?’<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘If there were to be a prophet after me it would have been Umar al-Khattab.’ Narrated by Uqbah bin Aamir, &amp; collected by Ahmad, Tirmidhee &amp; Hakim, &amp; made Hasan by al-Albaanee in Saheehah (327).<br /><br />[27]Narrated by Ibn Wadaah in ‘al-Bida’ p.31 &amp; al-Laalikaa’ee 100, (1/84).<br /><br />[28] He was the great Companion of the Messenger of Allaah, Abdullaah bin Mas’ood bin Ghafil bin Habeeb, died in 32 a.h. in Madina &amp; and Zubair led the funeral prayer and was buried in Baqi’.<br /><br />He was the sixth person to embrace Islaam even before Umar bin Khattab.  The Messenger of Allaah testified to his place in Paradise.<br /><br />‘Alee – may Allaah be pleased with him – mentions that the Messenger of Allaah ordered Ibn Masood to climb up a tree to bring something down from it, and his companions looked at the shins of Abdullaah bin Masood while he was climbing the tree, and they began to laugh at the thinness of his shins!  So the Messenger of Allaah said : ‘What causes you to laugh?! The leg of Abdullaah is heavier in the scales on the Day of Judgement than mount Uhud.’  Recorded by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad and authenticated by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir.(920).  One of the great recitors of the Qur’aan, it was said that he was one of the closest in guidance to the Messenger of Allaah.<br /><br />[29]Narrated by Ibn Batta’ in ‘al-Ebaanah’ 175 (1/327-328), &amp; al-Laalikaa’ee 104 (1/86).<br /><br />[30]Abdullaah bin Umar al-Khattab al-Qurashy, he died at the age of 83, in 63a.h. He was a great Companion and the son of the second Khalifah of Islaam, he embraced Islaam at a very young age.  He was killed by the order of Hajjaj during Hajj.<br /><br />Jaabir bin AbdAllaah said: ‘There wasn’t anyone of us except that we were affected by the world and its wealth, except for Umar and his son Abdullaah.<br /><br />Imaam  Maalik said : Ibn Umar is from amongst the leaders of the Muslims.<br /><br />[31]Narrated by Ibn Batta’ in ‘al-Ebaanah’ 205 (1/339) &amp; al-Laalikaa’ee 126 (1/92)<br /><br />[32]Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Bayhaqee, Ahmad authenticated by al-Hafidth Ibn Hajar.<br /><br />[33]Reported by Bukharee &amp; Muslim.<br /><br />[34]Those who attach themselves and adhere to the way of the Salaf, the first three generations based upon the hadeeth : ‘What I am upon &amp; my Companions.’<br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: There is no shame on the one who manifests the madhab of the Salaf &amp; and makes affirmation of it and connects themselves to it, indeed it is obligatory for one to do so &amp; this is acceptable because the madhab of the Salaf is nothing but the truth. (al-Fatawa 4/149).<br /><br />Shaykh Abdul Azeez ibn Baaz was asked about the permissibility of calling yourself Salafee/Attharee he replied: ‘if he is truthful in being Salafee and Atharee then this is acceptable as the Salaf used to say such and such is Salafee/Atharee, indeed it is waajib.’ (Tape: Rights of the Muslim, in Taif.)<br /><br />[35] Taken from Ilm Usool al-Bida’  p.191-120.<br /><br /><a href="http://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=1273" class="postlink">View Part One Here</a><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/317/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... 10/05/317/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 18, 2017 12:27 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Bida’<br /><br />A Clarification for those who Believe that there is Beneficial Bida’ &amp; Evil Bida’</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Compiled by<br />Bint AbdurRahman bin Yusuf al-Qurashi</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Contents</span></strong><br /><ul>1-        Foreword<br />2-        Introduction<br />3-        Chapter One: Definition of Bida’<br />4-       Chapter Two: Evidences that prove there is no good in Bida’<br />5-        Chapter Three: Doubts Concerning Bida’ Hassanah and the Answer to Them.<br />6-       The Sayings of some of the Imaams Regarding the Statement of Umar.<br />7-        Conclusion</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1-Foreword</span></strong><br /><br />This booklet is unique in that it is concise and succinct in its objectives, namely to clarify the fact that the religion of Islam is distinguished from all previous religions due to its unique fundamental principle of adhering to the Islamic texts without any alteration according to time or place or individual whims or desires.<br /><br />Bida’ hassanah is a concept whereby innovations can be injected into the pure religion of Islam, this act is abhorred in Islam by its scholars past and present, however there are groups of Muslims who mistakenly believe that it is permissible to innovate as long as the innovation is a good one.<br /><br />numerous books were used for this booklet May Allah reward those authors with good.<br /><br />What makes this take on this topic more hard hitting and powerful is the  way in which it brings forth proofs a person of Bida’ would bring and then refutes them from all possible angles, until there ceases to be any ammunition for those promoting Bida’ hassanah.<br /><br />Bint AbdurRahmaan (rahimuhuAllah) Ibn Yusuf Al-Quraishi<br /><br />17th June 1998<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 -Introduction</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him, and we seek His help and ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah’s’ refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah misguides none can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ is His slave and Messenger.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam.&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-­Watcher over you. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great achievement. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />To proceed: The truest speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ. The worst of affairs are the newly invented matters, every newly invented matter is an innovation, every innovation is a misguidance, and misguidance is in the fire….[1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">To proceed:</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed from the greatest of trials which have befallen the Muslim Ummah[2] today is Bida’ (innovations in religion). It has saturated the Muslim world completely, to such an extent that hardly anywhere is free from it and only a few people are saved from it.<br /><br />The subject of Bida’ is of great importance as it can lead to Kufr (disbelief).<br /><br />The innovators (mubtadi) oppose Allaah in His commands; therefore it is fitting that their repentance will not be accepted.<br /><br />Abdullaah bin Abbas[3] – May Allaah be pleased with him, said: Verily the most hated of matters to Allaah are Bida’.[4]<br /><br />Sufyaan at-Thawree[5] said: Bida’ is more beloved to Iblees than sins. Repentance from a sin is accepted; however there is no repentance for Bida’.[6] [7]<br /><br />One of the main reasons, for the widespread practice of Bida’, is the prevailing belief that Bida’ is permissible and acceptable.  The innovators have labelled this misconception as ‘Bida’ hassanah’ (a Bida’ which they regard as good and beneficial).  Therefore those upholding the validity of Bida’ hassanah, will claim ‘Indeed it is a good Bida’!’  This shows they accept the fact that it is a Bida’, but regard it as good!!<br /><br />Scholars of the past and present have covered this issue extensively and have authored many good books concerning it, books about this are lengthy and elaborate, which can be difficult for the average student to digest.  Though more concise books are available, they fail to address the issue successfully. Many of these books, cover the regulations concerning Bida’, but do not focus specifically on the topic of Bida’ hassanah.<br /><br />This book Insha’Allaah, is a concise refutation, clarifying the position of Ahlu-Sunnah concerning those who believe in the validity of Bida’ hassanah, illustrating that all Bida’ is in the fire without any exceptions.<br /><br />[1] This is the Khutbat ul-Haajah, which the Prophet used to say before starting a speech which he also used to teach to his Companions, refer to shaykh al-Albaanee’s booklet ‘Khutbat ul-Haajah’.<br /><br />[2] Nation – Refers to all of the Muslims collectively.<br /><br />[3] The great companion of the Messenger of Allaah, his name is Abdullaah bin Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, the son of the uncle of the Messenger of Allaah.  He was 13 years of age when the Messenger of Allaah passed away, he was known has the scholar of the Ummah.  He died in 70 A.H. in Taif.  It is authentically narrated that the Messenger of Allaah embraced him and supplicated ‘O Allaah teach him the wisdom.’  Ibn Umar said of him:’ He was the most knowledgeable from the Ummah of Muhammad about what was revealed to Muhammad.’<br /><br />[4]Al-Bayhaqee in al-Kubra (4/316).<br /><br />[5] Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree (161 A.H.) was born in Koofah in a place called Thawr, his kunya is Abu Abdullaah, he narrated many ahadeeth &amp; many scholars say that he was the Ameer ul Mumineen of hadeeth of his time.  His father was also a great Muhaddith (Scholar of hadeeth).<br /><br />AbdAllaah ibn Mubarak said: ‘I wrote hadeeth from over 1,100 shaykhs &amp; I didn’t write from anyone better than Sufyaan.<br /><br />Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: The Angels are the guardians of the heavens &amp; the Companions of hadeeth (as-haabul hadeeth) are the guardians in the earth.<br /><br />Refer to Thahdheeb at thahdheeb by Ibn Hajar 2/56 &amp; Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubalaa by adh-Dhahabee 7/229.<br /><br />[6] That is because the Mubtadi’ thinks his action is good, and regards it as something that will cause him to come closer to Allaah Azza wa Jal. For this reason he does not think of repenting from Bida’, rather he seeks reward for it as Allaah says: &lt;&lt; Is he, then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair-seeming, so that he considers it as good (equal to one who is rightly guided?)  &gt;&gt; (Fatir: 8), There is a difference regarding the sinner he sees himself as having shortcomings, he acknowledges that his action is evil, and if he is advised he repents. If a sinner repents to Allaah, He forgives their sins, and accepts their repentance, we ask Allaah for safety, goodness, capability and guidance.<br /><br />[7]Al-Laalikaa’ee (1/132), &amp; Abu Naeem in al-Hilyah (7/26) &amp; al-Bagawee in Sharh as-Sunnah (1/216).<br /><br /><a href="http://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=1273" class="postlink">View Part Two Here</a><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/bida-hassanah-part-1/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ah-part-1/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 17, 2017 11:43 pm</p><hr />

<category term="Innovations (Bid’ah) &amp; Their Principles" scheme="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewforum.php?f=13" label="Innovations (Bid’ah) &amp; Their Principles"/>
<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=1209&amp;p=1275#p1275"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Every Innovation Is A Misguidance</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Al-Albaani [1420H]</em><br /><br />One thing the Muslim scholars do not differ about at all is the fact that Islaam is established upon two magnificent and great fundamental principles. Indeed they are 1) worshipping only Allaah apart from others and 2) following and taking our example from only the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, apart from others.<br /><br />However, what I want to discuss here only concerns the principle that states: A Muslim’s Eemaan does not become complete until he believes that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah. And that if any person on the face of this earth were to bear witness to Allaah’s Oneness according to the three categories (of Tawheed), then he will not be a believer until he adds to that his belief that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, is His slave and messenger. So if it is this way, then it is required for every Muslim to learn the meaning of this beautiful statement (of Tawheed):<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“So know that Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah)”</span></strong> [Surah Muhammad: 19] and to acknowledge the true sense of its meaning in two parts. First, to believe in it and second, to put it into actuality in himself, his worship and his belief in Allaah.<br /><br />Likewise, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.”</span></strong> This testimony (of bearing witness that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah’s slave and messenger) completes the first testimony (of bearing witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So due to this, the testimony (of Faith) does not become complete unless the Muslim believes in this (second) testimony - understanding, believing and accepting it firstly, and then applying it in the affairs of his life secondly. So our saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger”</span></strong> requires, among other things, that we believe that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, conveyed the message and that he carried out his task in its complete and perfect form, such that no one that comes after him, however high or elevated he may be, can correct or amend some part of it. Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, indicated this fact in his saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.”</span></strong> [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]<br /><br />This is why it is authentically reported on the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, from numerous paths of narration that he said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“I have not left anything that will bring you closer to Allaah and distance you from the Hellfire, except that I have commanded you with it. And I have not left anything that will bring you closer to the Hellfire and distance you from Allaah except that  I have forbade you from it.”</span></strong> So there has not been left any room for amending anything from it, whether it be a simple or a trivial thing being amended.<br /><br />This is why it is reported on the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah (Madeenah), Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: &quot;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, which he deems is good, then he has claimed that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, has betrayed (the trust of conveying) the Message. Read the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">'This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.'</span></strong> [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3] So whatever was not (part of) the Religion on that day, is not (part of) the Religion on this day. And the last part of this ummah (nation) will not be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&quot;<br /><br />This was from the understanding of Imaam Maalik, the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah, such that he plainly stated in a clear Arabic language that whoever introduces into Islaam just one innovation and then claims that it is something good, he has in fact claimed that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, betrayed the Message. And whoever makes this claim, he does not believe (truly) that <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Muhammad is His slave and messenger.”</span></strong> As is very clear in the words of this noble Imaam, it (the innovation) is “not (part of) the Religion on this day.”<br /><br />So it is upon the Muslim to implement his <em>Ittibaa’</em> (following of the Prophet), such that he could be truthful in (his declaration that) Muhammad, Allaah’s Messenger, is His slave and messenger. And that he, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, brought the complete and pure message, without adding to it or subtracting from it. If this is the case, then every Muslim must acknowledge his extent and stop at the points where his Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, has placed limits for him, such as the acts of worship and deeds of obedience (to Allaah). This is because the pen has dried with what was revealed previously (i.e. no more revelation after Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam). And there was no room left open to approve of an act of worship that didn’t exist previously in the first days (i.e. of the Prophet). Consequently, our pious predecessors (Salaf As-Saalih) have come and gone all acknowledging the extent of the Prophet sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam in that he first fulfilled his mission and conveyed the Message, as you know. And (second) that he was the best worshipper amongst Allaah’s worshippers and the most fearfing of Allaah. So there is no room to correct him:<br /><br /><ul>1. From the standpoint of legislating (revealed matters) into the Religion, as you have heard the ayah and Imaam Maailk’s comments about it.</ul><br /><ul>2. Such that it can be claimed that there is someone who is a better worshipper and more worshipping (of Allaah) than Allaah’s Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. This is impossible.</ul><br />So whoever understands these two facts, which are related to one’s belief that Muhammad, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah’s slave and messenger, he will limit the worship he performs for Allaah to only that which has been reported on the Prophet sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam (in the ahaadeeth). And he will not put any example or role model before him other than the Prophet sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. Nor will he ever claim this second point, meaning it is impossible that it can get into the mind of any believer that he is more dutiful to Allaah or more fearing of Allaah or more worshipping of Allaah than him, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. This is something impossible.<br /><br />We will mention what has been reported in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik, radyAllaahu 'anhu, that a group of people went to see the Prophet sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, but asked his wives because they were not able to find him. So they asked his wives about the Prophet’s worship – about his standing in prayer at night, his fasting during the day and about his relations with his wives. So they mentioned to them what they knew about his guidance regarding that - and his guidance is the best guidance on the face of this earth as is stated in the khutbah al-Haajah: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.”</span></strong> The wives of the Prophet mentioned to these men that he, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, would fast and break his fast, and that he would pray at night and also sleep and that he would marry women.<br /><br />Anas, radyAllaahu 'anhu, said: “When they heard that from the wives of the Prophet, they found his sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam worship to be little.&quot; They thought it to be little because of what had settled in their minds that the Prophet must pray the whole night and that he must fast all the time and that he was a monk and did not go near his wives. So they were shocked to find something that was not in compliance with their notions. So they assumed that the reason for this was because Allaah had forgiven all of the Prophet's past and future sins. So it is as if they said: “The Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, only minimized in his worship - which they thought to be little - because Allaah had forgiven his sins.<br /><br />So there wasn't left any obstacle preventing him from increasing in the worship of his Lord.” This was a mistake on their part without a doubt. This is since they didn’t know that this worship which they thought to be little, was in fact worship that could not be fulfilled by even the best worshipper amongst mankind, not even Dawood (as) about whom it is authentically reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Dawood was the best worshipper amongst mankind.”</span></strong> This group of people did not know that the Prophet was the best worshipper amongst mankind with this worship (of his) and that not even the best worshipper amongst mankind was able to perform his worship, as I have mentioned.<br /><br />And that was from the things that he, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, was asked about when some people – who were well aware of his habits not like that group of people that was ignorant of his habits – found him, and they felt compassion for him, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, because they saw him standing in prayer until his feet had become swollen. So they said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins.” They meant by this: “Have pity on yourself, O Messenger of Allaah! Be easy in the worship, for your feet have become swollen.&quot; And his response was: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />This is a refutation of the false reasoning employed by that small band of people, who said the reason for the Prophet's little worship was because Allaah had forgiven his past and future sins. They were not aware that the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, would stand in night prayer until his feet would become swollen. So when it was said to him: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins”</span></strong>, he responded: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />Basing on what they imagined was little worship on the part of the Prophet and what they knew of Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins, each person in this small group assumed that they were obligated to exceed in worship and that they must surpass what they heard about the Prophet's worship with regard to his fasting, praying at night and relations with women. So they made the following pledges to themselves: The first person said &quot;I will pray all night and won't sleep.&quot; The second one said: &quot;As for me, I will fast all the time and never go a day without fasting.&quot; And the third person said: &quot;I will not marry women.&quot;<br /><br />Why? Because they assumed that marriage was a distraction and turned one away from perfecting one's worship to Allaah. But they did not know - and Allaah knows best but it seesm to me that they were new (reverts) to Islaam who did not learn yet of the Commands and Rulings of Islaam – that marriage was itself worship, as is found in the famous hadeeth, when a group of poor people came to the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, and said:<br /><br />&quot;The people with much wealth and income have surpassed us - they pray like we pray, they fast like we fast, and they make Hajj like we make Hajj. And they give money in charity but we don't give away anything in charity!&quot; So the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said to them: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Shall I not direct you to something, which if you do, you will surpass those in front of you and those behind you will never be able catch up to you (in reward), except for those who do the same as you?&quot;</span></strong> So the representative of the poor people went back to his companions among the poor folk and related to them the good news that came from the Prophet. So they became very happy at hearing it. However, it was not long before their representative went to Allaah's Messenger again to tell him: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah! What you told us was conveyed to the rich folk and so they have begun to do what we are doing.&quot; So Allaah's Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;That is the bounty of Allaah, which He gives to whom He pleases.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />This is the narration of Imaam Muslim found in his Saheeh. In another narration of the hadeeth, it is reported that the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said to them: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Verily in every  tasbeehah (saying SubhanAllaah) there is charity for you. And in every tahmeedah (saying Al-Hamdulillaah) there is charity. And in every takbeerah (saying Allaahu Akbar) there is charity. And in every tahleelah (saying Bismillaah) there is charity. Commanding good is charity and forbidding evil is charity. And removing a harmful obstacle from the road is charity.&quot;</span></strong> Then the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, continued to mention many noble characteristics. Then he said at the end of the hadeeth: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And in your having relations with your wife, there is charity.&quot;</span></strong> They said in amazement: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, will one of us fulfill his desire (with his wife) and get rewarded for that?&quot; So the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Don’t you see that if one fulfills it in a forbidden way, that he will have a burden (of sin) for it?&quot;</span></strong> They said: &quot;Of course, O Messenger of Allaah.&quot; So he said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Then likewise, if he fulfills it in a lawful way he will be rewarded for it.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />So they were not aware of the likes of this hadeeth and other hadeeths in which there is found an incitement to get married and especially in producing children and progeny, as is reported in the authentic hadeeth: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Marry the fertile and loving woman, for indeed I will compete with other nations by you, as regards to who has the most followers, on the Day of Judgement.&quot;</span></strong> So the one who marries and keeps himself chaste and keeps his wife chaste, he will be rewarded for that. This group was ignorant about this, so there was one among them who made a pledge binding on himself that he would not marry, saying: &quot;As for me, I will not marry women.&quot; Then that group left and when the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, returned home, his wives informed him of what they heard from that group of people and the pledges they made to themselves. So the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, gave a khutbah about this in his masjid, saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;What's wrong with these people who say such and such&quot;</span></strong> (?) - repeating to the audience what these individuals who came to his house had said. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;This last person will not marry women. The second said he would fast everyday and not go a day without fasting. And the other one said that he will pray all night and not sleep.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />However it was from the Prophet's etiquettes when admonishing, reprimanding and teaching the people that he would hide the faults of those who committed errors or sinned (by not mentioning their names). So he would not expose them but rather make such statements like the one you just read above: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;What's wrong with these people who say such and such?&quot;</span></strong> This is because there is no benefit in mentioning the (name of the) person who erred, unless his error involves a large group of people and he is present (for the reminder). But if the people leave and he leaves, the opportunity for reminding them goes away. So in this situation, one must mention that to the people publicly. And it is not like that which is thought by some people who know about wisdom and gentleness when commanding good and forbidding evil, for they do not realize that gentleness does not nullify manifesting the criticism of one who errs if his error involves a group of people. The stories of our Salaf (predecessors), all praise be to Allaah, are filled with reports bearing witness to this fact. It is sufficient for me to just mention what the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) reported in their Saheehs from the hadeeth of 'Abdullaah Ibn 'Umar who said:<br /><br />&quot;'Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, rady Allaahu 'anhu, was giving the Friday khutbah - naturally in the Prophet's masjid - when a man from the Companions of Allaah's Messenger entered - and in one narration it states that it was 'Uthmaan Ibn 'Affaan. So 'Umar stopped his khutbah and turned towards this person that had come late and had missed coming early to hear the dhikr and to hear the Jumu'ah khutah. So the man responded, saying: 'O Commander of the Believers, I did not do anything except hear the Adhaan, make wudoo and then come to the masjid.' So he said to him reprimanding him in a disapproving interrogating manner: 'The wudoo also, for I heard Allaah's Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, say: Whoever goes to (pray) Jumu'ah, then he should take ghusl (bath).'&quot;<br /><br />The point we derive from this report is that he, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, reprimanded 'Uthmaan Ibn 'Affaan publicly in front of a large gathering of witnesses because he came late to the Jumu'ah khutbah and prayer. So therefore: The principle of teaching and reminding someone is based on the foundation of: Hiding the faults of people, unless there is a benefit that requires that it be done in public. This is the principle that the Messenger of Allaah implemented when he gave the khutbah regarding that group of people that had come to his house. So he said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;What is wrong with these people who say such and such&quot;</span></strong> making an indication of them but not naming anyone of them.<br /><br />The point is that the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;As for me…&quot;</span></strong>, which is a refutation of the essence of what was stated by those people who claimed the reason that the Prophet, had little worship was due to Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins. So he said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don't fast&quot;</span></strong> - meaning I don't fast all the time. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And I pray at night and I also sleep&quot;</span></strong> - meaning I do not stay up the whole night, as is done by those extremists amongst worshippers who increase and try to surpass the worship of Allaah's Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. This is why 'Aa'ishah said, as is recorded in Saheeh Muslim: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;The Prophet, ssaallllAllllaaaahhuu ''aallaayyhhii waa ssaallllaam, never stayed up a whole night in worship.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />So the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said, reminding us that the Religion is moderation and that worhsip is moderation - neither exaggeration nor negligence: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don't fast. And I pray at night and I also sleep. And I marry women. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah then he is not from me.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />So the Prophet's Sunnah, as it came to us from Islaam, is that which all the Muslims are obligated to adhere to. And I guarantee that if Dawood, who was the best worshipper amongst mankind according to the testimony of Allaah's Messenger, came after the Prophet's being sent with this complete and perfect Islaam, he would not be able to encompass doing all of the Prophet's acts of worship. This means all of the acts of worship that Allaah's Messenger brought whether through speech, actions or silent approval. Due to this, there remain no grounds for any Muslim to add an act of worship after Allaah completed His Religion by sending His Prophet with this perfect Islaam.<br /><br />So after realizing that the Prophet is the best worshipper amongst mankind and the most dutiful and fearing of Allaah amongst them, there should not be anything but following of Allaah's Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. We are upon certainty that we will never be able to encompass the worship of Allaah's Messenger, except for occasionally or at brief periods of time. So we are completely incapable of following and tracing the footsteps of Allaah's Messenger in his worship. This is impossible - with respect to every individual amongst mankind after the Prophet.<br /><br />Therefore, there remains nothing before us except that we all strive for two things:<br /><br /><ul>1. To learn the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger in all matters that came to us from Islaam - whether in  reed or in Worship or in characteristics and manners. And as I said before, we will never be able to do more than just imitate him, as it is said:</ul><br /><ul>&quot;So imitate (them) if you are not like them,<br />Verily, imitating the righteous ones is success.&quot;</ul><br /><ul>It is not for us to imitate anyone amongst mankind except him, because he is the most perfect of humans according to unanimous agreement. And everyone that imitates him after he has gone will be overwhelmed by his ocean of worship.</ul><br /><br /><ul>2. This is the first thing - that we must know the Sunnah of Allaah's Messenger according to the wide and extensive meaning. This is since the Prophet's saying concerning that group of people: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;So whoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from me&quot;</span></strong>, this sentence in this general hadeeth does not refer to the abandonment of the recommended sunnah acts, for example, that this person is not from the Prophet. This is not what is meant by the hadeeth. Rather, the meaning of the hadeeth is: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah&quot;</span></strong> meaning from my Way and from my Methodology in all affairs of my religious life. This is the kind of person that is not from him. And this kind of person varies with regard to his remoteness from following the Prophet.</ul><br />So the Sunnah has two meanings:<br /><br /><ul>1. A religious Arabic language-based one, and it is that which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and those who followed his way were upon.</ul><br /><ul>2. That which has occurred in the custom of the Fuqahaa in dividing the worship into two types – Fard (Obligation) and Sunnah (Recommended). The Sunnah here according to their definition of it is: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;That which the one who does it will be rewarded for and which the one who abandons it will not be punished for.&quot;</span></strong></ul><br />As for the person that abandons the Messenger's Sunnah, with its first meaning - i.e. his way and methodology - then this person is in misguidance. And his deviance can either be large or little depending on his closeness or remoteness to following Allaah's Messenger, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam. So based on this, we should find ourselves as having no need for amending and introducing a &quot;good innovation&quot; (bid'ah hasanah) into Islaam, claiming that there is nothing wrong with this innovation. This is because we should find ourselves as falling short and being incapable of following the noble Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, in everything that has been reported to us concerning his worship, whether it is related to supplications, remembrances or prayers. So it is sufficient for us to just follow him, according to our abilities. Here, I would like to mention a story reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh so that you can realize the worth of Allaah's saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.”</span></strong> [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]<br /><br />Al-Bukhaaree reported that one of the Jewish Rabbis went to 'Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab during the time of his Khilaafah and said to him: &quot;O Commander of the Believers! There is an ayah in the Book of Allaah that if it had been revealed unto us - a gathering of Jews - we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of 'Eid (holiday).&quot; So he asked: &quot;Which ayah is it?&quot; So the Rabbi mentioned the ayah: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;This day I have completed your Religion for you…&quot;</span></strong> So 'Umar said: &quot;This ayah was indeed revealed on a day of 'Eid, on the day of Jumu'ah while the Allaah's Messenger was in 'Arafaat (meaning in his farewell pilgrimage). So this ayah was indeed sent down on a very great day in which there is a combination of two virtues and two 'Eids - the 'Eid of Jumu'ah and the 'Eid of 'Arafaat.&quot;<br /><br />Why did this Jew say: &quot;Had it been revealed unto us, we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of 'Eid?&quot; It is because he was aware of the greatness of this blessing, which Allaah bestowed upon His servants. But what about us Muslims today? Unfortunately, we do not give this great blessing its due weight in worth. This is why you find many people in the past - in previous generations - who have filled the Muslims with prayers, words of remembrance and supplications that the Prophet did not come with. What has come to us from the Prophet is truly sufficient and adequate, in fact it is more than our human capabilities can grasp. However, each one of us takes from this worship what he is able to and what conforms to his capability and capacity.<br /><br />[<strong><em>Al-Asaalah</em></strong>, Issue #21]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 04, 2017 2:10 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Who is A Mubtadi’? (Innovator)</span></strong><br /><em>Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />‘The Bida’ by which a person would be counted as from the Ahl-ul-Ahwa (the people who follow desires) is that which is well known by the people of knowledge of the Sunnah in it opposing the Book and the Sunnah; such as the Bida’ of the Khawarij[1], Rawafidah[2], al-Qadareeyah[3] and the Murjiah[4].’<br /><br /><em>[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />Whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the Ummah held a consensus about, and this opposition is without a valid reason, then this person is dealt in the same manner in which the People of Bida’ are dealt with.’<br /><br /><em>[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</em><br /><br /><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />Whoever worshipped with an act of worship which is not obligatory nor recommended, and he believed that it was obligatory or recommended, then he is a misguided Mubtada’, and this is an evil Bida’ not a good Bida’, and the imams of the Deen are in agreement about this, since Allaah is not worshipped except with that which is obligatory or recommended.’<br /><br /><em>[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 1/160]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Distinction Between a Bida’ and Ijtihad</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />‘And many from those of the Salaf and those who of the consecutive generations said and acted upon that which is a Bida’ and they were not aware that it was a Bida’, either due to a weak hadeeth which they thought was authentic, or due to what they understood of the Ayaat which were not the intent of the Ayaat, or due to an opinion that they held in an issue where the text did not reach them.’<br /><br /><em>[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 19/191]</em><br /><br /><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />‘As for the one whose sin is hidden or performs a Bida’ in secret, that Bida’ does not take a person outside of Islaam, and this person is not made Hijra (boycotted) from, on the contrary the person who is made Hijra from is the one who calls to Bida’.’<br /><br /><em>[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 24/175]</em><br /><br /><br />Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Question: </span></strong>Which Bida’ is it by which a person is counted as being outside the circle of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />‘The Bida’ such as of <em>al-Qadr</em>[5], <em>Bida’ of al-Irjaa</em>[6], <em>Bida’ of ar-Rafd</em>[7], <em>Bida’ of Kharooj</em>[8], and the <em>Soofeeyah Bida’</em> such as the <em>Mawlid</em>[9] which has Shirk and any other types of Mawlid.  Making journeys to graves and other types of Bida’ which are similar to this – may Allaah bless you.<br /><br />In having loyalty to the Ahl-ul-Bida’ a person becomes from amongst them, and likewise if he aids them and defends them.<br /><br />It was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘Indeed some people sit with the people of Bida’.’<br /><br />Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘Advise him.’<br /><br />The person said: ‘But he rejected the advice.’<br /><br />Ahmad said: ‘Count him from amongst them.’<br /><br />So, the one who sits with the Ahl-ul-Bida’ and associates himself with them then conclude from him that he is sick and that he is in agreement with these people, and regarding this point there are evidences, from them the saying of the Messenger :<br /><br />‘The souls are enlisted soldiers, those who become familiar with each other, associate with one another, and those who oppose each other, differ.’<br /><br />So this person who associates himself and becomes familiar with Ahl-ul-Bida’ then it is evident that there is an agreement and similarity between the matters, the two people and the two groups.<br /><br />To clarify, what we have mentioned is concerning the one who leaves the circle of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/153]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> What are the rulings concerning the people of Bida’?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />‘Indeed these people are divided into those who are Du’waat (callers to Bida’) and those who do not call to Bida’.<br /><br />As for those who call to Bida’, then these people can be given punishments which have been mentioned by the Imams of Islaam. From these punishments are banishment, just as Umar banished Sabeeg and others. Also from those punishments, are capital punishment, like they killed al-Ja’ad bin Dirham and al-Halaaj and others from the leaders of Bida’ and misguidance.<br /><br />As for their followers: then these are guided and it is explained to them and they are called to Allaah with wisdom and good exhortation.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/155]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee wrote:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">When is a man treated as Ahl-ul-Bida’</span></strong><br /><br />‘Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘If the scholars of the Companions and those who followed them and those after them differed in a matter then they would follow the command of Allaah in His saying:  &lt;&lt;  (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. &gt;&gt; [4:59]<br /><br />And they would debate an issue, in a consultative, advising manner. And perhaps they would differ in a knowledge based practical issue, yet, they would maintain their friendship and practice restrain to aid brotherhood in the Deen.<br /><br />However, whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the Ummah held a consensus about, and the opposition is without excuse, then this person is dealt in the same manner as the People of Bida’.’<br /><br />Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Abi Zayed al-Qayrawani (386) in his book ‘al- Jamia’:<br /><br />‘And there is a saying of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah: that this person (of the people of Bida’) is not excused, because his Ijtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) attracted him to Bida’; because the Khawarij made Ijtihad in interpreting, yet they were not excused. Their (erroneous) interpretation caused them to rebel against the Companions. The Messenger – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – labeled them as those that exited from the Deen. But as for Ijtihad (exertion in deriving a ruling) the Messenger – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – made it such that the Mujtahid (the person who derives a ruling) in rulings is rewarded even if he made a mistake in that ruling.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘al-Muhajjah al-Baydah fee Himayah as-Sunnah al-Ghara’ by Rabee’ al-Madkhalee p.144-145]</em><br /><br /><ul>[1] Rebelling against the Muslim leader.<br /><br />[2] The Shia, those who rejected the Sunnah and the Companions.<br /><br />[3] Those who reject pre-destination.<br /><br />[4] Those who do not accept that Eemaan increases and decreases.<br /><br />[5] Those who reject pre-destination.<br /><br />[6] Those who do not accept that Eemaan increases and decreases.<br /><br />[7] The Shia, those who rejected the Sunnah and the Companions.<br /><br />[8] Rebelling against the Muslim leader.<br /><br />[9] Celebrating the Prophet’s birthday</ul><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/who-is-a-mubtadi%E2%80%99/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... %E2%80%99/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 04, 2017 12:03 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Speaking About The People of Bida’</span></strong><br /><em>By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</em><br /><br /><em>Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:<br /><br />‘And if giving advice is obligatory for general and specific religious interests: like regarding narrators of hadeeth who make mistakes and lie then like Yahya bin Sa’eed said: I asked Malik, Thawri, al-Laith bin Sa’ad – I think it was him – and al-Awza’ee about a man who is accused in hadeeth or he does not memorize hadeeth? They said: ‘Make clear his condition.’<br /><br />Some of the people said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘I find it difficult to say about a person that he has such and such problem, and so and so is like such and such.’<br /><br />Imam Ahmad said: ‘If you remain silent and I remain silent when will an ignorant person know the authentic from the unauthentic?!’<br /><br />Likewise the leaders of Bida’ from the people who have statements that oppose the Book and the Sunnah, or worship which opposes the Book and the Sunnah, it is obligatory to clarify their condition and warn the Ummah against  them and this is in agreement with the Muslims.  So much so that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: Is a person who fasts, prays and makes Itikaf more beloved to you or speaking against the people of Bida’?’<br /><br />He answered: ‘If he fasts, prays and makes Itikaf then that is for himself, and if he speaks against the people of Bida’ then that is for the Muslims and that is better.’<br /><br />So it is clear that this benefit is general for all the Muslims for their religion and it is in the same class as Jihad in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the path of Allaah and His Deen, His Minahij (methodologies), His Sharia’ and repelling the injustice of these people and their hostility upon this is  a general responsibility, which is something that is in agreement among the Muslims.<br /><br />If it was not the case that Allaah made people in order to repel the harm of these people, the Deen would have become corrupted. The corruption of the Deen would be greater than the corruption caused by being conquered by the enemy at war. Since if these people take over they do not corrupt the hearts and what is in the heart is from the Deen, but they do it slowly, as for the People of Bida’ then they corrupt the hearts from the onset.’<br /><br />[Taken from  ‘Majmoo fatawa’ 28/231-232]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/speaking-about-the-people-of-bida%E2%80%99/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... %E2%80%99/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2017 12:05 am</p><hr />

Is it correct what some people say, that criticizing the people of innovation such as the sufis and other than them is from the reasons that separates the people and divides the Muslim Ummah?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Fawzan:</span></strong> Yes! We want to separate from the innovator and the pagans and the grave worshippers. We do not want them to unite with us. No one will gather with us except for the people of Tawheed; this is what we want. This is the intentional division. Allah made a separation between the believers and the disbelievers.<br /><br />أَفَمَنْ كَانَ مُؤْمِنًا كَمَنْ كَانَ فَاسِقًا لَا يَسْتَوُونَ<br /><em>Is then he who believes like the one who is rebellious and wicked?

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Eating from the deceased’s house on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and on other days according to the Hanafis</span></strong><br /><em>Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br />First published 1999</em><br /><br />’Abdullaah Ibn Ja’far says, when the news of the death of Ja’far (radiyallaahu ’anhu) reached the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) he said:-<br /><br /><ul>“Prepare food for the House of Ja’far because a thing has come to them that has preoccupied them.” [Aboo Daawood (2/59), at-Tirmidhee (2/173), al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (1/372), Imaam al-Haakim said this hadeeth is Saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed in his checking and Imaam Ibn Sakeen has also said it is Saheeh.] Imaam Shaaf’iee (d.204H) – rahimahullaah – has said: “That I prefer or like for the relatives of the deceased that on the day of the death they prepare so much food for the household that it will last them the day and night so that they are satisfied because this is the Sunnah and it is good, and this is the action of the people of Good before and after us, because when the news of the death of Ja’far reached the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) he said prepare food for the House of Ja’far because that thing has come to them that has preoccupied them.” [Kitaabul-Umm (1/317)] Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah (radiyallaahu ’anhu) (d.51H) said: “We (i.e. the Companions) would consider it a form of lamenting and mourning to gather at the deceased’s house to eat from there” [Related by Ibn Majaah (1/513), Naylul-Awtaar(4/97) and in Muntaqal-Akhbaar (p. 221)]</ul><br />With another wording it says<br /><br /><ul>“That we would consider it a form of mourning to gather at the deceased’s house and to prepare food after the burial” [Related by Ahmad (11/125-126)] It has come in authentic narrations that crying on the deceased loudly, lamenting and mourning are actions of the people before Islaam and according to the majority of the Salafus-Saaliheen it is unlawful [Imaam Nawawee says there is ijmaa’ (consensus) on it in his Sharh Saheeh Muslim (1/303)] and the same is understood for eating from the deceased’s house,</ul><br />This narration is narrated via two chains,<br /><br />Al-’Allaamah al-Haythamee writes about one of them that it is Saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaaree and he writes about the other one that is Saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim. [Refer to Majma’uz-Zawaa‘id of al-Haythamee]<br /><br />Al-Haafidh Ibn Humaam (d.861H) writes:<br /><br /><ul>“Its chain of narration is Saheeh.” [Fathul-Qadeer (1/473)]</ul><br />Al-’Allaamah al-Halabee writes:<br /><br /><ul>“The chain of narration is Saheeh.” [Kabeeree (p. 609)]</ul><br />Al-’Allaamah Ibn Ameer al-Haaj al-Maalikee (d.737H) writes :<br /><br /><ul>“Preparing the food of the deceased and the gathering of the people, then there is no mention of this but it is an innovation and disliked.” [al-Madkhal (3/275) ] And he writes: “Some people have introduced this innovation that on the third day they prepare food at the deceased’s house and this is a norm amongst and within them.” [al-Madkhal(3/275) ]</ul><br />Imaam Ibn Hajar al-Makkee ash-Shaafi’ee was questioned: “What is the hukm (Ruling) on the food that is prepared in the deceased’s house for the fuqaraa‘ [The poor, destitute] on the third and the seventh day”?He replies<br /><br /><ul>“All the things mentioned in the question all in all of them are prohibited innovations (bida’ mamnoo’ah).”[Fataawaa Kubraa (2/7)]</ul><br />Al-’Allaamah Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Mabnajee al-Hanbalee (d.777H) [Tasleetatul-Masaa‘ib (p. 99)]<br /><br />Imaam Shamsud-Deen Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbalee (d.682H) and [Sharh Miqna’ Lil-Kabeer (2/426)] Imaam Muwaffiqud-Deen Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbalee (d.620H) write:-<br /><br /><ul>“The food that is prepared for the people by the deceased’s family is (makrooh) because by this the family is further pushed into trouble and unnecessary pre-occupation and also there is mushabbahah (resembling) the polytheists and the people of ignorance.” [ al-Mughnee (2/413)]</ul><br />Al-’Allaamah Ibn ’Aabideen ash-Shaamee (d.970H) writes:-<br /><br /><ul>“That this is our madhhab [Meaning the Hanafees] (way) and that of the Shaafi’iyyah and the Hanaabilah.”[Shaamee (1/841)]</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ACCORDING TO THE AHNAAF:</span></strong><br /><br />As fuqahaa‘ (scholars of Islaamic jurisprudence) from other methodologies have rejected this innovation likewise and in fact even more the fuqahaa‘ of the Ahnaaf have done so.<br /><br />Al-’Allaamah Taahir Ibn Muhammad al-Hanafee (d.542H) writes:-<br /><br /><ul>“To feast from the house of the deceased up until three days is not permissible, because feasting is done only at times of happiness.” [Khulasal-Fataawaa (2/342)]</ul><br />Imaam Qadhee Khan writes:<br /><br /><ul>“In the days of calamity [Loss of a close relative for example] feasting is disliked (makrooh), because the acts that are done during the times of happiness are not appropriate at times of sadness.” [Fataawaa Tataar Khaaniyyah (4/781)]</ul><br />Likewise the same is said in Fataawaa Siraajiyyah [Fatawaa Siraajiyyah (p. 75)]<br /><br />Al-Haafidh Ibnul-Hummaam (d.861H) writes:<br /><br /><ul>“Preparing food in the house of the deceased is makrooh (disliked), because feasting is at times of happiness, not sadness and this is a very bad and detestable innovation.” [Fathul-Qadeer (1/473)]</ul><br />Al-’Allaamah Qahsataanee writes:<br /><br /><ul>“In those days, preparing food in the deceased’s house and eating the food is makrooh(disliked) as has been mentioned in Hayrul-Fataawaa.” [Jaami’ur-Ramooz (3/443)]</ul><br />It says in Fataawaa Alamgeeree [Of Sultaan Alamgeer (d.1118H) compiler of Fataawaa Alamgeeree]<br /><br /><ul>“Preparing food in the deceased’s house up until three days is makrooh.” [Fataawaa Alamgeeree (1/167)] (as has been mentioned in Tataar Khaaniyyah)</ul><br />And Imaam Haafidhud-Deen Ibn Shihaab Kardaree Hanafee writes:-<br /><br /><ul>“For three days feasting is disliked (makrooh) and so is the food because feasting is at the times of happiness and preparing food on the first, second and third is also makrooh and likewise after a week (seven days) and at the times of ’Eed and also related to this is the taking of food to the graves seasonally is also makrooh. Gathering the reciters and pious for reciting the Qur’ân and after this calling people to eat food is makrooh. Preparing food for the recitation of Soorah’s al-An’aam and al-Ikhlaas is also makrooh and the final word is that preparing food after or for the recitation of the Qur’ân is makrooh.” [Fataawaa Bazzaaziyyah (4/81)]</ul><br />The same thing on this Subject is mentioned in Shaamee [Shaamee (1/841)]<br /><br />Al-’Allaamah Hisaamud-Deen ’Alee Muttaqee [Author of Kanzul-’Ummaal] (d.975H) Whilst refuting innovation and the people of innovation says:<br /><br /><ul>“The ijtimaa’ (gathering) on the third day specifically is neither fard, waajib, sunnah nor mustahab, neither is there any worldly benefit in it. Nor it is advisable but rather it is an accusation, reviling and blame on theSalaf because they did not mention it but even more dangerous than this is upon the (accusation, blame) Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) because he did not mention the rights of the deceased and the worst of all is the blame on Allaah because he did not complete the Sharee’ah (And therefore the Religion is dependent on our innovations) whereas Allaah says:“This day I have perfected your Religion for you, completed my favour upon you and chosen for you Islaam as your Religion.” [Sooratul-Maa‘idah [5:3] [From Tahfeemul- Masaa‘il (p. 172)]</ul><br />Imaam Nawawee (d.676H) writes in Sharhul-Minhaaj:<br /><br /><ul>“That gathering at the grave on the third day and distributing roses (flowers) and incense and feeding the people within specific days i.e. the third, fifth, ninth, tenth, twentieth, fortieth, sixth month and after a year, then all in all these actions are prohibited innovations (Bida’ mamnoo’ah)” [From Anwaarus-Sati‘a]</ul><br />Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree (d.1014H) whilst mentioning the narration of ’Aasim Ibn Kulayb also writes:<br /><br /><ul>“That our madhhab’s (Hanafee) fuqahaa‘ have proven the point that preparing food in the deceased’s house on the first day, third day and after a week is makrooh.” [Mirqaat (5/482)]</ul><br />For further information see:<br /><br />1) ’Abdul-Hayy Lucknaawee’s Majmoo’a Fataawaa (3/76-77)<br /><br />2) Shaykh ’Abdul Haqq ad-Dahlawee’s (d.1052H)<br /><br /><ul>(a) Madaarijun-Nabuwwah (1/421)<br /><br />(b) Safarus-Sa’aadat (p. 273)<br /><br />(c) Isha’atul-Lamahaat (1/745)</ul><br />3) Qaadee Thanaa‘ullaah Panee Patee’s (d.1225H) Wasiyyah Nama (p. 191)<br /><br />4) Shaah Waliyyullah Muhaddith Dahlawee’s (d.1176H)<br /><br /><ul>(a) Tafheemaat (2/247)<br /><br />(b) Wasiyyah Nama (p. 13)</ul><br />5) Makhdoom Jahaniyyah Jahah Ghast’s (d.800H) ad-Daarul-Manzoom (p. 783)<br /><br />6) Muiudeen Barkalee Naqshbandee al-Hanafee’s (d.981H) Tareeqah Muhammadee (last page)<br /><br />And it goes on<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">OBJECTIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">FIRST OBJECTION:</span></strong><br /><br />They say that eating from the deceased’s house is not impermissible or Makrooh because in Mishkaat al –Masabeeh [(2/544)] a narration comes that when the Messenger if Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) finished burying a person (Astaqbah da’ee imra’ah) A messenger from the deceased’s wife to the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) to give him an invitation to eat.<br /><br />Al-’Allaamah al-Halabee [In Kabeeree (p. 609) and Sagheeree (p. 300)] and Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree [In Mirqaat (5/482)] (d.1014H) write:<br /><br /><ul>“This hadeeth is a proof for the command for eating from the deceased’s house and it is correct, otherwise the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) would never have ate.” [See also Anwaarus-Sati’a (p. 109)]</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE ANSWER:</span></strong><br /><br />The reasoning from this hadeeth is not correct.<br /><br />Firstly: the Word (imra’ah) is either a doubt by the author of Mishkaat or a scribes mistake because the proper word is (imra’atin) that a woman’s messenger came to give an invitation to the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) rather than the messenger of the deceased’s wife. This narration is also found in:<br /><br /><ul>[1] Aboo Daawood (2/117)<br /><br />[2] Mushkilul-Aathaar (2/132)<br /><br />[3] Ma’atasir (p. 169)<br /><br />[4] Sharh Ma’aaniyyul-Aathaar (2/320)<br /><br />[5] ad-Daaraqutnee (2/545)<br /><br />[6] Musnad Ahmad (5/293)<br /><br />[7] Sunanul-Kubraa (6/97)<br /><br />[10] ’Uqoodul-Jawaahiril-Muneefah (2/62)<br /><br />[11] Hasaa‘isul-Kubraa (2/103)<br /><br />[12] Mustadarakul-Haakim (4/234)<br /><br />[13] al-Muhallaa of Ibn Hazm (7/415)<br /><br />[14] ’Awnul Ma’bood Sharh Sunan Aboo Daawood (3/249)<br /><br />[15] Bahdhal Majhood Fee Haal Abee Daawood (4/239)</ul><br />All these books mention the word (imra’atin) and this is the correct wording.<br /><br />Secondly, some people who have accepted the wording as (imra’ah) have given the following answer:<br /><br />[1] Some have said that this incident is specific with Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam)<br /><br />[2] And others have said other things, but they try to prove this point by ta‘weel trying to legislate eating from the deceased’s house.<br /><br />Ahmad Ridaa Khaan Bareilwi (d.1920CE) has answered this by saying the woman had invited the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) previously and by the will of Allaah the husband died and the eating at the deceased’s house by the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) was not on the basis of death but rather on the basis of promise. So we find that Ahmad Ridaa Khaan Bareilwi refutes the position of Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree and al-’Allaamah Halabee. This also clarifies the position of Ahmad Ridaa Khaan Bareilwi as he was not in favour in eating from the deceased’s house. [Ahkaamush-Sharee’ah (3/194-197)]<br /><br />Thirdly, those who rely on the word (imra’ah) and the understanding of Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree’s position, then let them not be fooled because Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree himself retracted from this position and adopted the correct position and he writes clearly<br /><br /><ul>“Eating from the deceased’s house is disliked (makrooh) and an innovation.” [Sharh Naqayah (1/40) ]</ul><br />Ahmad Ridaa Khaan Bareilwi after answering the understanding of Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree and al-’Allaamah al-Halabee he writes:<br /><br /><ul>“If Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree and Halabee saw the customs and tradition about today they would have most definitely pronounced a ruling. And there is no doubt that legislating its permissibility will open the doors for the rejected Shaytaan and it will put the lazy Muslims into a lot of trouble and we pray to Allaah that he keeps us upon the straight path.” [Ahkaamush-Sharee’ah (3/197)]</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">SECOND OBJECTION</span></strong><br /><br />When the Messenger of Allaah’s (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) son Ibraaheem died, Aboo Dharr al-Ghafaaree (radiyallaahu ’anhu) on the third day gathered some dates, milk and wheat food and placed them in front of the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) and he recited Soorah’s Faatihah and Ikhlaas and made supplication and said to Aboo Dharr al-Ghafaaree (radiyallaahu ’anhu),<br /><br />“Divide this amongst the people so that the reward from this reaches my beloved Ibraaheem.”<br /><br />So from this they try to prove two things [i] preparing food on the third and [ii] making supplication over the food place in front. They say this narration was mentioned by Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree in his book Awzajundee.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ANSWER:</span></strong><br /><br />Mawlaanaa ’Abdul-Hayy al-Lucknaawee writes:<br /><br /><ul>“Neither is this book Awzajundee a writing of Mullaa ’Alee Qaaree, nor is this narration authentic or reliable rather it is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and baatil and it cannot be relied upon. There is no trace of this narration in any of the books of hadeeth.” [Majmoo’ul-Fataawaa (2/74)]</ul><br />Ahmad Ridaa Khaan Bareilwi says about the Faatihah recitation on Thursdays that,<br /><br /><ul>“These are detestable, shameful, ignorant and baatil acts and it is necessary to remove them.” [Ahkaamush-Sharee’ah (1/10)]</ul><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/eating-from-the-deceaseds-house-on-the-3rd-7th-14th-and-on-other-days-according-to-the-hanafis/">http://www.salafiri.com/eating-from-the ... e-hanafis/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jan 30, 2017 10:46 pm</p><hr />

(Refer to Radd al-Mukhtaar (1/429), al-Bahr ar-Raa’iq (2/19) and Fath ul-Qadeer Sharh Hidaayah (2/114). Tasreeh Haashiyyah Talweeh (pg.27) quotes from Imam Abu Haneefah and Imaam Muhammad Shaybaanee that according to them makrooh here means and denotes something that is haraam and prohibitively disliked.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1. Shaikh Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee [561H]</span></strong><br /><br />“The grave should be a handspan above the ground….however it is makrooh (prohibitively disliked) to make the grave with mortar.” (Ghuniyyatut-Taalibeen (pg.640)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2. Imam Abu Haneefah [150H]</span></strong><br /><br />His student Imam Muhammad Shaybaanee said, “We do not see to increase more than what has been taken out from it (ie te soil for the grave) it is rebuked to build the grave with mortar, or to plaster it with soil, or to put a landmark on, or to make a masjid near it or to write on it, then all of their affairs are prohibited. similarly it is also prohibited to build them with solid bricks or to put bricks inside. There is also no harm in sprinking water over them and this is the statement of Abu Haneefah.” (Kitaab al-Aathaar  (pg.126)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3. Imaam Ibraaheem an-Nakaa’i [96H]</span></strong><br /><br />“It is narrated from Ibraaheem an-Nakhaa’i that he would consider it to be makrooh (prohibitively disliked ie unlawful in this context) to put a mark on a grave, to use solid bricks in the sidewall of the grave and or to build the grave.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4. Imam Muhammad Shaybaanee [189H]</span></strong><br /><br />Muhamamd ash-Shaybaanee said, “Abu Haneefah informed me that he said one my Shaikhs said to me whilst transmitting it to the Prophet (r) that he prohibited us from squaring the grave and from making the grave solid (ie with bricks, mortar, cement or plastering) Muhammad Shaybaanee said we take this and so does Abu Haneefah.” (Kitaab al-Aathaar pg.251, also refer to his book Kitaab al-Asal (1/422), and his al-Jaam’e as-Sagheer (pg.118)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5. Allaamah Mahmood Aloosee [1270H]</span></strong><br /><br />He writes, “There is consensus that from the most haraam things and that which leads to shirk is praying near tombs, making masjids or structures over them. Therefore it is obligatory to destroy such structures or domes that have been erected over graves as they are more destructive than masjid ad-Diraar because they have been established in disobedience to the Messenger of Allaah (r) ….” (Rooh al-Ma’anee (15/238)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6. Allaamah Marghinaanee Hanafee [593H]</span></strong><br /><br />He is the author of al-Hidaayah, he says, “Using solid bricks and wood on graves is prohibited because elements are for making solid structures whereas graves are desolate.” (Hidaayah (2/100) with Fath ul-Qadeer)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7 &amp; 8. Allaamah Ibn al-Humaam [821H]</span></strong><br /><br />He said, “Abu Haneefah said it was prohibited to make structures over graves…. and Abu Yoosuf also considered it to be prohibited to write on the graves. This is because the Jaabir narrates from the Messenger of Allaah that he said, “Do not make graves solid neither make structures over them, nor sit on them or write on them.” (Fath ul-Qadeer (2/100) Sharh Hidaayah)<br /><br />He also said, “This is because of what they used to do like, elevating graves and building beautiful and elevated structures over them. We do not mean the amount (of earth) rather the amount that is needed to distinguish the grave from the normal ground.” (Fath al-Qadeer (2/101)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">9. Allaamah Abdullaah bin Ahmad an-Nasafee Hanafee [710H]</span></strong><br />    He said, “Do not make graves into squares nor make them solid.” (Kunzud-Daqaa’iq Ma’a al-Bahr ar-Raa’iq (2/194)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">10 &amp; 11. Allammah Ibn Najm ud deen Hanafee  [970H]</span></strong><br /><br />He said in the explanation of the the words in the Kunz, “Making graves solid is prohibited from the hadeeth of Jaabir because the Messenger of Allaah said “Do not make graves solid neither make structures over, nor sit on them or write on them.” (Kunzud Daqaa’iq Ma’a al-Bahr ar- Raa’iq (2/194)<br /><br />He also said, “The graves should be elevated from a hand span, and it is said four fingers, and what has been transmitted in the Saheeh from Alee about the command to level the graves concerning what is more than that.” (Kunzud Daqaa’iq Ma’a al-Bahr ar-Raa’iq (2/194)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">12. Allaamah Qadhee Khaan Hanafee [596H]</span></strong><br /><br />He said, “Graves should not be made to be plastered because the Messenger of Allaah forbade us from making plastering graves, from using silver on them and from building structures over them… also because it is narrated from Abu Haneefah who said graves should be made solid nor should they be plastered or a structure to be made over them.” (Fataawa Qadhee Khaan (1/93)<br /><br />    <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">13. Fataawa Alamgheeree</span></strong><br />It is stated in it, “And the grave should be made curved by a hand span, and not square, nor should they be plastered. There is no harm in sprinkling water on them, and it is Makrooh to build structures on graves, to sit or to sleep on them.” (Fataawa Alamgheeree (1/166)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">14. Fataawa Tataarkhaaniyyah.</span></strong><br /><br />It is mentioned in this Fataawa, “The graves should not be kissed because this is the custom of the Christians.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">15. Allaamah A’laa ud deen al-Hasakafee [1088H]</span></strong><br /><br />He said, “And they (the graves) should not be plastered because of the prohibition against it” (Durr ul-Mukhtaar (1/125)<br /><br />16. Allaamah Ibn Abideen Shaamee [1252H]<br /><br />He said “As for the building on them (ie graves), I have not seen anyone opine in allowing this” (Radd ul-Mukhtaar Sharh Durr al-Mukhtaar (1/601)<br /><br />17. Allaamah Aynee Hanafee [855H]<br /><br />He said, “And they should not be coated with plaster, nor should any structures be built over them, because this is for (making the graves) solid and for beautification.” (Rumz al-Haqaa’iq Sharh Kunz (1/67), also al-Binaayah Sharh Hidaayah (3/302-303) of Allaamah Aynee.)<br /><br />18. Allaamah A’laa ud deen al-Kasaanee Hanafee [587H]<br /><br />“It is narrated from the Prophet (r) that he forbade likening the graves with the built up (urban) areas, solid (baked) bricks and wood are used for built up urban areas and because solid bricks are used for beautification, the deceased is not in need of this.” (Badai’a as-Sanai’a (1/372)<br /><br />19. Qaadhee Ibraaheem al-Halabee Hanafee [956H]<br /><br />He said, “The Three Imaams (Abu Haneefah, Muhammad Shaybaanee and Abu Yoosuf) said it was makrooh to plaster graves or to cover the graves with clay due to the Haddeth of Jaabir….. is transmitted from Abu Haneefah that he said it is Makrooh to build structures like houses, domes or things similar to them because of the aforementioned Hadeeth.” (Halabee al-Kabeer (pg.599)<br /><br />20. Allaamah Siraaj ud deen Hanafee [773H]<br /><br />He said, “It is Makrooh (prohibitively disliked ie unlawful) to build on graves.” (Fataawa Siraajiyyah (pg.24)<br /><br />21. Allaamah Abu Layth Samarqandee [373H]<br /><br />He said, “It is Makrooh to plaster graves, to cover them with clay, to build on them, to write on them or to mark them by putting a sign on them.” (Fataawa an-Nawaazil (pg.82)<br /><br />22. Allaamah Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Qadooree Hanafee [428H]<br /><br />He said, “And using Solid (baked) bricks and wood (on graves) is Makrooh” (Qadooree (pg.60)<br /><br />23. Allaamah Abu Bakr ibn Ali al-Haddaad al-Yamanee [800H]<br /><br />He said, “It is Makrooh to, envelope graves with clay, to plaster them, to build on them, to write on them because of his (The Prophet’s (r)) statement, “Do not do plaster graves, do not build on them and do not sit on them.”” (al-Jawhirrah an-Nayrah (1/133)<br /><br />24. Allaamah Ubaidullah ibn Mas’ood Hanafee [747H]<br /><br />He said “And using solid bricks and wood is prohibitively disliked” (Sharh Waqayaah (1/240)<br /><br />25. Allaamah at-Tahtawee [1231H]<br /><br /> “The three (Imaams Abu Hanefah and his two students) said they (ie the graves) should not be plastered because of the saying of Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah forbade doing this…And the prohibition by the Prophet (r) indicates what they have mentioned is Makrooh Tahrimee (prohibitively disliked as to being unlawful)” (In his notes to Maraqee al-Falaah A’la Sharh Noor al-Aydah (pg.335)<br /><br />26. Allaamah Sayyid Murtadha az-Zubaydee [1205H]<br /><br />He said, “The mentioning of the narration that shows it is Makrooh to plaster graves.” (Uqood al-Jawaahir al-Muneefah Fee Adillah Madhab al- Imam Abee Haneefah (1/103).<br /><br />27. as-Sarkhasee Hanafee [571H]<br /><br />He reports from the Prophet (r) that he, “He (The Prophet (r)) forbade plastering graves” (Mabsoot (2/62)<br /><br />28. Qadhee Ibrahim Hanafee<br /><br />He said, “And the domes built over graves, it is obligatory to destroy them because they have been built in disobedience and opposition to the Messenger , and every construction that is built in disobedience and opposition to the Messenger deserves more to be destroyed than the mosque of Dhirar.” (Majalis ul-Abraar (pg.129)<br /><br />29. Allaamah A’la ud deen as-Samarqandee [539H]<br /><br />He said, “The Sunnah concerning the grave is that it should be slightly curved and not square, it should not be enveloped with clay, nor plastered, and Abu Haneefah held to be Makrooh to build on graves.” (Tuhfatul Fuqaha (1/400)<br /><br />30. Allaamah A’laa ud deen Turkamanee [745H]<br /><br />He said, “The graves are to be levelled as done per usual.” (al-Jawhar an-Naqee A’la Baihaqee (4/3)<br /><br />31. Allaamah Hasan ash-Sharnublaalee Hanafee [1069H]<br /><br />He said, “Using solid bricks and wood is prohibitively disliked (ie Makrooh Tahreemee)(ie using them on graves)… it is haraam to build on graves for beautification and it is prohibitively disliked if it is done to (make the grave) solid after burial” (Noor al-Aydah Ma’a Tarjamah Noor ul-Isbaah (pg.153)<br /><br />32. Qadhee Thanaullah Pani Pati Hanafee [1225H]<br /><br />He writes, “and what which is practiced at the graves of saints that they build high structures, the lighting of lanterns or anything else that they do synonymous to these matters are all Haraam and are prohibitively disliked.” (Mala Bud Minhu (pg.67)<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">33, 34, 35 &amp;36. Allaamah Mulla Alee Qaree [1014H]</span></strong><br /><br />In explanation of the Hadeeth mentioning innovation of misguidance, he said, “And this is what the Imams of the Muslims shunned like the building on graves and plastering them.” (Mirqaat Sharh Mishkaat (1/414)<br /><br />He also said, Shaikh Mulla Alee Qaree in explanation of the hadeeth, “They have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship” The reason for being cursed is because they would prostrate to the graves of the rophets in veneration, and this is clear and open shirk. They would to pray to Allaah at the places where the Prophet’s (r) were buried. They would prostrate on their tombs and they would face their graves whilst being in a state of prayer thinking that they are worshipping Allaah. Thereby Exaggerating in the veneration of Prophet’s (r) and that is hidden shirk. It contains veneration of the creation which has and there is no authorisation for. The Prophet (r) forbade his Ummah from doing thisas it is the practice of jews, It contains hidden shirk and this is what some of the comenetaors from ours Imaams have said.” (Mirqaat, Sharh Mishkaat (2/ 202]<br /><br />Mulla alee Qaaree also said, “Oh Allaah do not make my grave an idol” Meaning Oh Allaah do not make my grave like an idol which people venerate, or a place place of frequent visitation, or greeted with the prostratiosn, Like we hear and we see nowadays in some of the shrines (and tombs) that we witness.” (Mirqaat Sharh Mishkaat (2/228)<br /><br />He also said, “It is cited in al-Azhaar, (He the Prophet (r)) forbade the plastering of graves due to prohibition, to make structures (over graves) is to plaster them. This forbiddance of erecting structures is even so if the individual is the owner (of the land) and it is Haraam if the shrine is is common and in the open. It is therefore obligatory to demolish them even if it is a masjid.” (Mirqaat Sharh Mishkaat (3/1217)<br /><br />37. Imaam Shaafi’ee [204H]<br /><br />He said, “I did not see the graves of the Muhaajireen or of the Ansaar to be plastered (ie solid). The narrator (Tawoos said) said from the Messenger of Allaah he forbade the building of stuctures over graves and from plastering graves (in order to make them solid)… I have seen the leaders demolishing the structures built over graves in Makkah and i did not see the jurists (Fuqaha) eprimand them for this.” (Kitaab al-Umm (1/277)<br /><br />38. Imaam Muzanee [264H]<br /><br />It is narrated from him that he said, “Structures/domes should not be built over graves neither should they be plastered (in order to make them solid)” (Mukhtasar al-Muzanee (no.37)<br /><br />39. Imaam Nawawee [677H]<br /><br />He said in explanation of the hadeeth of Jabir, “Nonetheless building structures over graves if the the place belongs to the one who is building the structure then it is prohibited and it is if is a generally in the open then it is Haraam as texts from Imaam Shaaf’iee and his followers elucidate. Imaam Shaafi’ee said in al-Umm, “I have seen the Imaams of Makkah they would instruct the demolition of structures built over graves and they would present the (the hadeeth of the Prophet (r)) in support for their demolition, “Do not see a grave except that it is level with he ground.” (Sharh Saheeh Muslim (7/32), Study Edn. (1/312), refer also to al-Majmoo (5/296)<br /><br />40. Allaamah Ibn Hajr al-Haithamee Makkee [974H]<br /><br />He said, “It is obligatory to to destroy and flatten the high graves and the structures and domes build over them.” (az-Zawaajir Fee Iqtiraab al- Kabaa’ir (pg.163)<br /><br />41. Allaamah Abdul Wahhaab ash-Sha’araanee.<br /><br />He said, “The Prophet (r) prohibited plastering graves (ie making them solid) and from sitting on them.” (Kashf al-Ghummah Ann Jamee’a al- Ummah (1/149)<br /><br />42 &amp; 43. Shaikh Abdul Haqq Dehlawee Hanafee<br /><br />He said, “The grave should not be touched with the hands nor be kissed. One should also now bow towards the garave and neither should be rub or place his face on the earth (of the grave) as this is the custom of the Christians.” (Isha’ah al-Lama’aat Sharh Mishkaat (1/763)<br /><br />He also said in another place, “It is unlawlful and prohibited to kiss the graves, to prostrate towards them and to put your cheeks on them. Someone has narrated it is permissible to kiss the grave of your parents, however what is correct and authentic is not to kiss the graves.” (Mudarrij an- Nabuwwah (2/424)<br /><br />44. Allaamah Mujadid ud deen Fairozabaadee [817H]<br /><br />He said, “They (The Salaf) would not raise the graves or build them with bricks. Nor would they make structures or domes over graves. All of these affairs are innovations which are prohibited and they oppose the way of the Prophet (r). As he sent Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and said to him to destroy all the images and level all the graves to the ground. He also forbade building masjids over graves and from putting light (lanterns) over the graves and he cursed such actions.” (Safar as-Sa’adah A’la Kashf al-Ghummah (1/183)<br /><br />45. Shaikh Mujaddid Alf Thanee Hanafee<br /><br />He said, “He (prohibitively) disliked that graves be kissed.” (Zubdatul Maqaamaat (pg.210)<br /><br />46. Shaikh Qutb ud deen Dehalwee Hanafee<br /><br />He said, “The grave should not be touched nor be kissed. Similarly one should not bow towards the grave or rub his face on the earth of the grave as this is the habit and custom of the Christians.” (Mazaahirul Haqq (2/85)<br /><br />47. Imaam Sufyaan ath-Thawree [161H]<br /><br />He would say it is impermissible to make houses, a masjid or to farm land over graves. (Mu’assasah Fiqh Sufyaan ath-Thawree (1/681-682), Musannaf Abdur Razzaaq (3/506)<br /><br />48. Imaam Kaysaan<br /><br />Imaam Tawoos transmits from his Father, Kaysaan he would prohibit the building of structures over graves or to plaster them. (Musannaf Abdur Razzaaq (3/506 no.6493)<br /><br />49. Imaam Tawoos ibn Kaysaan [106H]<br /><br />He said in reply to Nu’maan ibn Shaybah, “Do you not know The Prophet (r) forbade us from building structures over graves, plastering them (to make them solid) or to curtain them off, verily your best grave is that which is unknown.” (Musannaf Abdur Razzaaq (3/506 no.6495)<br /><br />50. Imaam Hasan al-Basree [110H]<br /><br />He would say it is prohibited and makrooh to cover the grave with clay and to plaster to them (in order to make them solid)” (Mu’assasah Fiqh al-Hasan al-Basree (2/773), Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (3/29), al- Muhalla (5/133)<br /><br />50 &amp; 51. Allaamah al-Hajaawee Hanablee and Allaamah al-Buhootee Hanablee<br /><br />They said, “The grave should be a handspan from the ground because the Prophet’s (r) grave was also a handspan from the ground. as-Saajee has transmitted via the hadeeth of Jaabir it is makrooh to have the grave more than a handspan…. It is also prohibited to plaster the grave, to shape it and to beautify it with ornaments. It is an innovation to build structures over graves whether they are level with the graves or not due to what Jaabir narrates from the Messenger of Allaah (r) that he forbade the plastering of graves, sitting on them and from building structures over them. This is narrated by Muslim.”(ar- Rawdh al-Murab’e Bi-Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqn’e (1/104-105)<br /><br />52. Allaamah Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee [620H]<br /><br />He said, “It is prohibited to make structures over graves, plastering them and putting a headstone with writing on it because Imaam Muslim has transmitted in his Saheeh the the Messenger of Allaah (r) forbade the plastering of graves (with the intention of making them solid) and building over them. Imaam Tirmidhee added “and also writing o them (ie the headstone) and said this hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh and the prohibition is due that such is beautification and the deceased is not in need of it.” (al-Mughnee (3/439)<br /><br />53. Allaamah A’laa ud deen al-Mardawee<br /><br />He said, “It is makrooh to plaster graves, to build on them and to write on them. Plastering graves (to make them solid) is makrooh without any difference of opinion. Similarly putting a headstone, to shape it and to beautify it with ornaments are all innovations. Nonetheless erecting structures over graves is makrooh according to the correct madhab whether the structures is level with the ground or not.” (al-Insaaf Fee Ma’arifah ar-Raaj’e Min Khilaaf A’la Madhab al-Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (2/549)<br /><br />54 Qaadhee Abu Shuj’ah al-Asfahaanee<br /><br />He said, “Structures should not be built over graves and nor should graves be plastered (for them to be made solid)” (Matn al-Ghaayah Wat- Taqreeb (pg.14)<br /><br />55 &amp; 56. Allaamah Ibn Rushd al-Qurtubee [595H]<br /><br />He said, “Imaam Maalik and Imaam Shafi’ee said it is makroob to plaster graves (in order to make them solid)” (Bidaayatul-Mujtahid (1/449)<br /><br />He also said, “So it is prohibitively disliked to pass (by the grave alot) and thereby sending salutations upon him. Similarly regular visitation of the grave and sending salutations there may transform it into a masjid. The Messenger of Allaah (r) forbade us from this with his saying, “Oh Allaah, do not make my grave an idol.” (al-Bayaan Wat-Tahseel (18/444-445)<br /><br />57. Allaamah Abu Mudhaffar ibn Habeerah<br /><br />He said, “(The 4 Imaams) are unanimously agreed it is makrooh ie prohibitively disliked use raw bricks on graves…” (al-Ifsah Ann Ma’aanee as- Sihaah Fil-Fiqh Alal Madhab al-Arba’a (1/156)<br /><br />58. Allaamah Qaadhee A’yaadh [554H]<br /><br />He was asked about people of Madeenah who stand by the grave once a day or more, and they send salutations and make supplicate for a while. He said, “I have not heard this from any of the people of fiqh, and nothing is good for the latter part of this ummah except that which was good for its first part. I have not heard from the people of the earlier period of this ummah that they used to do that.” (ash-Shifa Bit- Ta’reef Huqooq al-Mustafaa (2/676)<br /><br />59. Imaam Maalik [179H]<br /><br />He said “It is makrooh to plaster graves and to build structures over them.” (al-Muduwwanah al-Kubraa (1/170)<br /><br />60 Abul Hasan Moosaa Kaadhim [183H]<br /><br />He said, “It is not correct to build structures over graves or to sit on them, to plaster them or to put clay on them.” (Tahdheeb ul-Ahkaam (1/461), al-Istabsaar (1/2187<br /><br />61 &amp; 62. Imaam Ja’afar Saadiq [148H]<br /><br />He said, “The Messenger of Allaah prohibited praying on graves, sitting on them and making structures over them.” (Tahdheeb ul-Ahkaam (1/461), al-Istabsaar (1/482)<br /><br />He also said, “Do not build structures over graves…” (Tahdheeb ul- Ahkaam (1/461)<br /><br />63 Allaamah Muhammad bin Jamaal ud deen [786H]<br /><br />He said, “A grave should be 4 fingers high from the face of the ground.”<br /><br />64. Allaamah Abu Ja’afar Toosee [460H]<br /><br />He said, “The grave should be made 4 fingers high from the ground and no addition earth should be put back than what was originally removed. There is consensus that it is prohibitively disliked (ie Makrooh Tahreemee) to plaster graves and to make structures over permissible places….It is also makrooh to renovate and to restore a graves after they have deteriorated.” (al-Mabsoot al-Fiqh al-Imaamiyyah (1/187).<br /><br />65. The Hanafee book ‘Sharh Jaam’e Sagheer’ mentiones, “Graves should not be touched nor kissed because this is the habit and custom of the Christians.”<br /><br />66.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Weakness of the Hadeeth of Abu Ayoob of Placing His Face On The Grave Of The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)</span></strong><br /><em>By Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari &amp; Abu Hibbaan (compiled 2002)</em><br /><br />under the subtitle: “<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Domes over the Grave of the Awilya</span></strong>.”<br /><br />G F Haddaad said &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Dawud ibn Salih said: “[The governor of Madina] Marwan [ibn al-Hakam] one day saw a man placing his face on top of the grave of the Prophet. He said: “Do you know what you are doing?” When he came near him, he realized it was Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. The latter said: “Yes; I came to the Prophet, not to a stone.” Ibn Hibban in his Sahih, Ahmad (5:422), Al-Tabarani in his Mu`jam al-Kabir (4:189) and his Awsat according to Haythami in al-Zawa’id (5:245 and 5:441 #5845 Book of Hajj, “Section on the honoring of the dwellers of Madina, chapter on placing one’s face against the grave of our Master the Prophet saws” and #9252 Book of Khilafa, “Chapter on the leadership of those unworthy of it”), al-Hakim in his Mustadrak (4:515); both the latter and al-Dhahabi said it was sahih. It is also cited by al-Subki in Shifa’ al-siqam (p. 126) and Ibn Taymiyya in al-Muntaqa (2:261f.).<br /><br />The use of the word “stone” in the prevous hadith indicates that the Prophet’s (s) grave was built up with stone already in the time of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (ra). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">END OF HIS WORDS</span></em><br /><br />The likes of G F Hadaad and callers to shirk use the above hadeeth to establish the permissibility to go to the grave of the Messenger of (Saas) for worship and othe associated acts of shirk.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">REPLY &amp; ANSWER</span></strong><br />This incident is mentioned in Majma’a az-Zawaa’id as mentioned by G F Haddaad but Haafidh Haithamee said after referencing and attributing this hadeeth to Imaam Ahmad, Tabaraanee in al-Kabeer and al-Awsth, he says, “The chain contains the narrator Katheer bin Zaid, and a group of people said he is reliable whereas Imaam Nasaa’ee and others have declared him to be weak.” (Majma’a az-Zawaa’id (5/243).<br /><br />Why was this portion of the text from Majma’a omitted. The only viable answer that comes to mind is that G F Hadaad copied and pasted this from some soofee bareilwi moulvee without actually checking or verifying it himself. We suggest in future the propagators or sympathisers with such calls of shirk and grave worship should take some valuable time out to verify these ahadeeth as any mistakes (in the hadeeth rendering it weak) in not doing so will result in misguidance of the people being on their heads.<br /><br />Furthermore, this is not from the levels of trustworthiness or truthfulness that a person merely quotes half of the statement and leaves the other, which is crucial to the discussion. This is a result of ta’assub and tahzzub and blind following of their scholars, may Allaah save us from this.<br /><br />Imaam Ibn Abee Haatim said, “The manuscript that Abu Bakr ibn Khaithmah wrote with us, in it Yahyaa ibn Ma’een was asked concerning Katheer ibn Zaid to which he replied, “He is not strong.” (al-Jarh Wa-Ta’deel (7/150).<br /><br />Ibn Abee Haatim also said, “My father was asked concerning Katheer ibn Zaid, he replied, “Righteous, but he is not strong.” and Abu Zur’ah was asked about him and he said, “Truthful but he has weakness.” (al-Jarh Wa-Ta’deel (7/150).<br /><br />Imaam Nasaa’ee himself said, “Katheer ibn Zaid is weak and this chain contains Dawood ibn Saaleh, and he is unknown (Majhool).” (Kitaab adh-Dhu’afaa Wal-Matrookeen (p.303) and (p.302) of two Indian editions.)<br /><br />See also the words Haafidh Ibn Hajr in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (3/188-189) as he mentions Katheer ibn Zaid as one of the narrators of this narration.<br /><br />G F Haddaad then cited some other references for this narration and he said as-Subkee has also cited this in ash-Shifaa as-Siqaam Fiz-Ziyaarah Khair al-Anaam. However the level of accepting some of the book and rejecting other parts as Allaah has mentioned regarding the jews then G F Haddaad and his associates have also demonstrated this.<br /><br />We also find here G F Haddaad has copied and pasted this information from many of the Hanafee bareilwi soofee books as the narrations used by them to establish shirk are all the same and universal and it is these narrations that they rest the foundation of their religion upon. Also from these deceptive acts begin to understand the authentic hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (Saas) when he said, “You will follow in the footsteps of the nations before you, handspan by handspan, and in another narration just as shoe lace resembles the other shoe lace….”<br /><br />And also we begin to realise which people the Messenger of Allaah (Saas) was talking about when he said, “The day of Judgement will not up until people from my ummah indulge in idol worship” (Tirmidhee, who said the hadeeth is hasan)<br /><br />And no doubt grave worship is idol worship.<br /><br />Subkee after bringing this narration said, “I could not acquire any information about this narration.” (ash-Shifaa as-Saqaam (p.102).<br /><br />and lastly another transmitter (ie compiler) of this narration Haafidh Haithamee said, “This hadeeth of Abu Ayoob is weak.” (Haashiyyah al-Aydah (p.219).<br /><br />So we say with what face did you G F Haddaad bring this narration to prove the permissibility of grave worship, as it is weak, and we know from the principles that a weak hadeeth cannot be used to establish a ruling in the sharee’ah.<br /><br />HE SAID &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,The use of the word “stone” in the prevous hadith indicates that the Prophet’s (s) grave was built up with stone already in the time of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (ra). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br /><em>The above statement of G F Haddaad is only true if the hadeeth is narration is authentic, and as established above it is weak, so then how can the deduction be made of the grave being built up. So here we have a lie built upon not knowing the authenticity of hadeeth and it is a deliberate attempt to confuse the people with the permissibility of grave worship. May Allaah save us from this</em><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/the-weakness-of-the-hadeeth-of-abu-ayoob-of-placing-his-face-on-the-grave-of-the-messenger-of-allaah/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2012 ... of-allaah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jan 27, 2017 9:38 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Ruling of Al-Misbahah (Dhikr Beads) – Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud din al-Albani [1420H]</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Translated<br />Aqeel Walker</em><br /><br />Ash-Shaikh Muhammad Naasir ud-Deen Al-Albaanee said in As-Silsilah Adh-Dha’eefah (1/110) with his checking of the hadeeth “What a wonderful reminder the subhah (thikr beads) are.” (A fabricated hadeeth):<br /><br />Then, verily the hadeeth, in reference to its meaning, is false according to me for reasons:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The First:</span></strong><br /><br />That the subhah (thikr beads) is an innovation that did not exist in the time of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). It was only introduced after him (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), so how could it be thought that he encouraged his companions to do a matter that they did not even know (i.e. thikr beads were not known to them)? And the proof regarding what I have mentioned is what Ibn Wadhdhaah reported in “Al-Bida’ wan-Nahy ‘anhaa” (Innovations and the Prohibition of them), on the authority of As-Salt bin Bahraam that he said,<br /><br /><ul>“Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a tasbeeh (string of beads) with her that she was using to glorify Allaah, so he cut it and threw it away. Then he passed by a man who was glorifying Allaah using pebbles so he kicked them with his foot, then said, ‘Indeed you all have went ahead (of the companions), you have wrongfully engaged in an innovation, and indeed you have overcome the companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in knowledge.’”</ul><br />And the chain of narrators of this narration is authentic (Saheeh) back to As-Salt, and he is reliable from the followers of the successors (Atbaa’ ut-Taabi’een, third generation).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Second:</span></strong><br /><br />That it opposes his (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) guidance. ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Amr said,<br /><br /><ul>“I saw the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) counting the glorification of Allaah with his right hand.”</ul><br /> And Al-Albaanee also said (1/117): And if there was nothing in the thikr beads other than one evil, and it is that it has overcome the Sunnah of counting with the fingers or it almost has – this is along with their agreement that the fingers are better – then this would be sufficient (as an evil). For verily it is rare that I see an old man counting the glorification of Allaah on his fingers!<br /><br />Then, verily the people have become specialized in inventing things along with this innovation. So you will see some of those who attribute themselves to one of the Soofee paths hanging thikr beads around his neck! And some of them count (the remembrance of Allaah) while they are speaking to you or listening to you talk! And the last thing that my eye fell upon from that some days ago was that I saw a man on an ordinary bicycle riding along on it on some roads crowded with people, and in one of his hands was some thikr beads! So they try to show to the people that they are not heedless of the remembrance of Allaah even for the blinking of an eye. And often times this innovation is the cause of losing the performance of that which is obligatory, for indeed it has happened to me repeatedly – and likewise to others besides me – that I have given the greeting of Salaam (peace) to one of these people, so he responds to the greeting by waving without saying the Salaam. And the harms of this innovation cannot be counted, so how beautiful is the statement of the poet:<br /><br /><ul>“And every good is in following those who went before (salafa),<br /><br />and every evil is in the innovating of those who came after (khalafa).”</ul><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></em> As-Silsilah Adh-Dha’eefah, Vol. 1, no. 110, and no. 117 <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alalbany.net/">http://www.alalbany.net/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2017 10:10 pm</p><hr />
