<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">How does a Father Teach his Children Tawheed?</span></span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">كيف يعلم الأب أبناءه التوحيد؟</span></span></strong><br /><br />Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya<br /><br />Shaykh Allama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">How does a father teach his children Tawheed?</span></strong><br /><br />He answered:<br /><br />‘He teaches them Tawheed just like he teaches them other matters of the Deen. From the best of what is in this subject is the book <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘The Three Principles’</span></strong> by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab. If he makes them <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">memorise</span></strong> it by heart and <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">explains</span></strong> to them its meanings appropriately to their understanding and their intellects.<br /><br />Then there comes a lot of goodness from this. This is because this book is built upon questions and answers, and clear easy expressions, which have no complexity.<br /><br />Then the father <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">shows them the Ayaat of Allaah (His signs)</span></strong> so that he can practically implement what is mentioned in this small book.<br /><br />For example,  the sun, the father asks, who created it? Likewise the moon,  the stars,  the night and day, you say to them:<br /><br />‘The sun, who created it? Allaah.<br /><br />The moon?   Allaah,  the night?  Allaah, the day?  Allaah.  Allaah -Azza wa Jal- created all of these. This is so that one can water the tree of the Fitrah (the natural disposition) because the human himself has been created with his natural disposition upon Tawheed of Allaah -Azza wa Jal.<br /><br />Like the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:<br /><br />(كل مولود يولد على الفطرة ، فأبواه يهودانه أوينصرانه أو يمجسانه)<br /><br />‘Every newborn is born upon the Fitrah (natural disposition), so it is his parents who either make him into a Jew or into a Christian or into a Majoos (fire worshipper).’<br /><br /><em>- Also he teaches them Wudu, how to make Wudu by demonstration and saying: This is how one does Wudu, and he performs the Wudu in front of him.<br /><br />- Likewise the Salah(prayer), along with taking aid with Allaah Ta’ala, and asking Allaah -Azza wa Jal- for guidance for them. Also, that one keeps away from any statement which opposes good behaviour or every prohibited action, so he should not get them used to lying,  cheating and treachery,  nor lowly manners.</em><br /><br />Even if the father was trialed by prohibited actions, like if he was trialed by smoking,  he should not smoke in front of them because they will get used to it and it will become easy upon them to do it as well.<br /><br />One should know that every man of a household is responsible for the people of the house, due to the saying of Allah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala:<br /><br />(يَا أَيُّهَاالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً)<br /><br />《 O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell)》[Tahreem: 6]<br /><br />Our protecting them from the fire cannot be except if we get them used to righteous actions and to leave off bad actions. The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- affirmed that in his saying:<br /><br />(الرجل راع في أهله ومسؤول عن رعيته)<br />‘A man is a shepherd for his family and he is responsible for his flock.’<br /><br />A father should know that their being righteous is beneficial to him in this world and the hereafter Indeed from the closest of people to their fathers and mothers are the righteous children, male and female.<br /><br />(وإذا مات الإنسان انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث: صدقة جارية، أو علم ينتفع به،أو ولد صالح يدعو له )<br />‘When a person dies his actions cease except for three: continuous charity,  or knowledge people benefit from,  or a righteous child who supplicates for him.’<br /><br />We ask Allah Ta’ala to aid all of us upon carrying out the trust and responsibility.’<br /><br />[Silsilah Noor ala Darb.
