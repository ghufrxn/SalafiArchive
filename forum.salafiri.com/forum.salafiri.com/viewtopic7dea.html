				<h3>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee on the Books a Student of Knowledge Should Read</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee on the Books a Student of Knowledge Should Read in the Areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth &amp; Fiqh</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />The Shaykh was asked which books he advises a student of knowledge to read in the areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth and its science, and Fiqh.<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />He specifically stated that a student should memorize and understand (in the topic of ‘Aqeedah):<br /><br />(1) al-Usool ath-Thalaathah,<br />(2) Shuroot us-Salaah wa Arkaanihaa wa Wajibaatihaa,<br />(3) al-Qawaa’id ul-‘Arba’ah,<br />(4) Shuroot Laa Ilaaha illAllaah,<br />(5) Nawaaqid ul-Islaam, and<br />(6) Kitaab ut-Tawheed, all by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab.<br /><br />As for (7) Kashf ush-Shubuhaat, then he said that if a person memorizes it, then that is good, but he did not stress it as with the above works.<br /><br />Also, he did not stress memorizing (8) al-Waasitiyyah, but instead said that a student can either memorize it or learn it and understand it well.<br /><br />He also mentioned that a person should study (9) the various treatises contained in Majmoo’ Fataawaa Shaykh ul-Islaam Bin Taymiyyah (presumably al-Fatwa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, ar-Risaalat ut-Tadmuriyyah, al-‘Eemaan, etc., although he did not name names), and (10) Sharh ut-Tahaawiyyah by Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee (d. 792) if he wants to expand his scope regarding the subject of Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.<br /><br />As for the other subjects, I do not recall him specifically saying that a student should memorize anything except for the one who desires to learn about the differences between the four madhaahib in Fiqh. He said that it is befitting for such a person to memorize a matan (lower level Fiqh manual) for each of the four madhaahib.<br /><br />In the area of hadeeth, he mentioned:<br /><br />(1) al-Arba’een an-Nawawiyyah,<br />(2) ‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam, and<br />(3) Buloogh ul-Maraam.<br /><br />Although he did not specifically say that one should memorize them, I have heard other Scholars (such as Shaykh Saalih ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh) say that one should begin his course in hadeeth with the memorization and study of al-Arba’een. The more famous explanations for it are that of an-Nawawee (d. 676) himself, which is a very brief explanation for beginners, that of Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702), which is perhaps a middle-level explanation, and that of Ibn Rajab (d. 795), which is more advanced and thorough than the rest.<br /><br />The Scholars have also recommended that the more advanced and dedicated students should memorize and learn the other two: ‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam andBuloogh al-Maraam by ‘Abdul-Ghanee al-Maqdisee (d. 600) and Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalaanee (d. 852) respectively.<br /><br />As for tafseer:<br /><br />He said that a person should start with the tafseer of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa’dee (d. 1376), titled Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaam il-Manaan, because its author is a well-known Salafee (and hence does not fall into the same ta’weel and mistakes of the other lower-level tafaaseer, such as al-Jalaalayn).<br /><br />He then said that if a person can find a Salafee teacher to guide him, he should study Fath ul-Qadeer of Shawkaanee (d. 1250) – this is because the teacher will help him:<br />(a) Be alert to some of the mistakes of Shawkaanee regarding as-Sifaat, and<br />(b) Help him with the more difficult aspects of the ‘Arabic language that occur in the book.<br /><br />Finally, he mentioned Tafseer Ibn Katheer, stating that it is okay if a student studies from one of the various abridgements available nowadays (like that of ar-Rifaa’ee).<br /><br /><strong>Taken From 22 Question About the Salafee Da’wah.<br />Shaykh Muhammad Amaan ibn ‘Alee al-Jaamee</strong><br /><br />Translated By: Abu ‘Abdul ‘Azeez al-Misree<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/15/booksamanaljamee/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/15/booksamanaljamee/</a><!-- m --></div>
