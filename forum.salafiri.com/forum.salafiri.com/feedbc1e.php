<title type="html"><![CDATA[Regarding Prayer in Rented Buildings in the West - Shaykh Fawzaan]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=394&amp;p=423#p423"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />O' Noble Shaikh, may Allah grant you success he (the questioner) says: In the Western lands there are some masaajid in rented buildings. The five daily prayers and Jumu'ah are established in these masaajid. Despite that, it is seen that some Muslims, from those who live in the vicinity of this masjid, hold that the prayer is not permitted in it because it is a rented building and not owned by the worshippers. So is this speech of his correct?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br /><br />This individual does not want to pray with the jamaa'ah and is seeking an excuse for himself. Who is it that said to him that the prayer is not permissible in a rented place? Who said this to him? The prayer is permissible in any place that is set up for the prayer, whether it is rented or not rented. This renting is due to a need and a necessity in the lands of the disbelievers and the lands of the West. This is a good action. However, this individual is not one who prays with the jamaa'ah or he doesn't pray at all, and he is seeking for himself this excuse.<br /><br />Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br /><br />Tafseer Hizb ul-Mufassal, Question &amp; Answer Session, dated (22/3/1431H).<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://video.albaseerah.com/2010/03/is-it-permissible-to-have-masjid-in.html">http://video.albaseerah.com/2010/03/is- ... id-in.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Sat Sep 17, 2016 12:11 am</p><hr />
