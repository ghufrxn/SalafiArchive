At the time of the battle of Badr he was not at the age of puberty. He participated in the battle of Khandaq and later he participated in other battles and the bay’ah of ar-Ridwan. <br /><br />3. Jabir Ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radi Allahu Anhu) said, “All of us inclined towards the world when the world fell at our feet (meaning the world was granted to us and it became easily available to us) except for Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu) and his son (Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu)) (they did not become inclined towards the world whilst they were granted it easily). (al-Mustadrak 3/560 hadith no.6369 and it’s chain is authentic and al-Hakim authenticated on the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him) <br /><br />4.

He lived for 60 years after the death of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam). Nothing was hidden from him about the circumstances of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) and the companions (Radi Allahu Anhum). (to the end of the saying) – (al-Mustadrak 3/559 hadith no.6363, and its chain is good)<br /><br />For more details regarding his virtues see my book: Tahqiqi Maqalat (vol.1, pg.325-338)<br /><br />Knowledge Of Narrations:<br /><br />There are 2630 ahadith with repetition in the Musnad of Imam Baqi Ibn Makhlad.
