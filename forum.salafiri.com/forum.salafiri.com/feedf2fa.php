<strong>Statements of the Salaf and later scholars</strong><br /><br />Umar Ibn Al-Khattāb (may Allāh be pleased with him, died 23H) said to Suwayd Ibn Ghaflah: “O Abu Umayyah! Indeed I do not know, perhaps I will not see you again after this year. So even if a crippled Abyssinian slave is placed [as a ruler] in charge of your affairs, hear and obey him. And if he beats your back, be patient. If he denies you [your rights], be patient. If he desires to command you with a matter that causes you deficiency in [acting on] your Religion, then say: ‘I hear and obey, my blood, not my Religion.’ But do not split away from the body of the Muslims [under his rule].” (Ibn Abi Shaybah in Al-Musannaf, 6/544 no. 33711; Al-Khallāl in As-Sunnah, 1/111 no. 54; Al-Ājurri in Ash-Sharī’ah, 1/161, no. 71, others with an authentic chain)<br /><br />Imam Muzani the student of Imam Shafi'i due to whom the Madhhab of Imam Shafi'i spread said in his Sharh Sunnah:<br /><br /><a href="https://postimg.cc/G9S7XtNF" class="postlink"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/m2Tv2Fy5/Muzani-Statement.png" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Imam Tahawi in Aqeeda Tahawiyyah said:<br /><br /><a href="https://postimg.cc/ph3jnwGF" class="postlink"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nrhGNZq0/Tahawi-statement.png" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Al-Hasan al-Basri narrated: Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) mentioned the rulers and the evil rulers, and he mentioned the leaders and the evil leaders. He stated that the misguidance of some of them will fill what is between the sky and the earth! So he was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, should we not strike them with the sword?” He replied: “No. So long as they establish the prayer, then no.” (Reported by Al-Imām Nu’aym Ibn Hammād (died 239H) in Kitāb Al-Fitan, 1/185, no. 491)<br /><br />Imam Ahmad said in Usool Sunnah: Whoever revolts against a leader from among the leaders of the Muslims, after the people had agreed upon him and united themselves behind him, after they had affirmed the khilaafah (leadership) for him, in whatever way this khilaafah may have been, by their pleasure and acceptance or by (his] force and domination [over them], then this revolter has disobeyed the Muslims, and has contradicted the narrations of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) And if the one who revolted against the ruler died he would have died the death of ignorance. And the killing of the one in power is not lawful, and nor is it permissible for anyone amongst the people to revolt against him. Whoever does that is an innovator, (and is] upon other than the Sunnah and the [correct] path.<br /><br />Imam Barbaharee (D.329 AH) in Sharḥ Al-Sunnah <br /><br /><a href="https://postimg.cc/pm0JL6HD" class="postlink"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5tJ7phKk/Barbarharee-1.png" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://postimg.cc/QHhQk3NQ" class="postlink"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15NvSmLj/Barbarhee-2.png" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Al-Barbahārī (Sharḥ Al-Sunnah p113, 114) states, “If you see a man supplicating against the ruler, know that he is an innovator (ṣaḥib hawā), and if you see a man supplicating for the ruler, know that he is a Sunni – inshā Allāh.”<br /><br />Al-Imām Al-Ājurrī (d360H) states (Al-Sharī’ah Vol.1 p371), “I have mentioned warnings against the ways of the Khawārij that convey the message for everyone who Allāh protects against the ways of the Khawārij, and who does not hold the views of the Khawārij, but is [instead] patient over the injustice of the rulers … and who prays for the wellbeing and righteousness of the rulers, and who does Hajj and Jihād behind the rulers against every enemy of the Muslims, and who prays the Jumu’ah and ‘Eid prayers behind the rulers. Whoever fits this description is upon the Straight Path – inshā Allāh.”<br /><br />Aboo Bakr al-Aajurree (d. 360H) said in ash-Sharee’ah (p. 28), ‘It is not fitting for the one who sees the uprising of a khaarijee who has revolted against the Imaam, whether he is just or oppressive - so this person has revolted and gathered a group behind him, has pulled out his sword and has made lawful the killing of Muslims - it is not fitting for the one who sees this, that he becomes deceived by this person’s recitation of the Quraan, the length of his standing in the prayer, nor his constant fasting or his good and excellent words in knowledge when (it is clear to him that) this person’s way and methodology (madhdhab) is that of the Khawaarij.’<br /><br />Shaykh Al-Islām Abu ‘Uthmān Ismā’eel As-Sābooni (died 449H) stated: “Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah do not hold that it is permissible to revolt against them (rulers) even if they see from them abandoning justice and replacing it with tyranny and injury…” He ended his treatise saying: “These sentences which I have affirmed in this chapter was the creed of all of them (i.e. the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah). None of them differed regarding it with each other. Rather, they agreed by ijmā’ with it all.” (See ‘Aqīdatus-Salaf As-hābul-Hadeeth, p. 32)<br /><br />Al-Imām Abul-Hasan Al-Ash’ari (may Allah’s mercy be upon him, died 324H) stated: “Ijmā’ number 45: Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah have agreed upon hearing and obeying the rulers of the Muslims. And whoever gains authority over the people [in a country] whether with their pleasure or by overpowering, then obedience is given to them, whether they are righteous or sinful. It is not allowed to revolt against them regardless if they are tyrannical or just.” (Risālah ilā Ahlith-Thaghar, p. 168)<br /><br />Shaykh Al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (died 728H) stated: “The best and most excellent of the Muslims forbade from rebellion (khurooj) and fighting in times of fitnah as was the stance of Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar, Sa’eed Ibn Musayyib, Ali Ibn Al-Husayn, and other than them. They prohibited the people [of Madinah] in the year of Harrah to rebel against Yazeed Ibn Mu’āwiyah just as Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujāhid and others prohibited revolt during the fitnah of Ibn Al-Ash’ath (who rose against Al-Hajjāj). So based upon this, the affair of Ahlus-Sunnah was established and settled upon abandonment of fighting in times of fitnah due to the authentic and firmly-established ahādīth reported from the Prophet (ﷺ). So Ahlus-Sunnah started to mention these narrations in their ‘Aqeedah (Creed) and they commanded with patience in the face of the tyranny of the rulers, and not to fight them. This came about even though a large number of the people of knowledge and religion [before this] had fought during fitnah.” (Minhāj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah, 4/529-530)<br /><br />Imām An-Nawawi (died 676H) cited an ijmā’ (consensus) concerning this matter: “As for rebellion (khurooj) against them and fighting them, then that is harām (prohibited) by ijmā’ (consensus) of the Muslims, even if the rulers are sinners and oppressors. The ahādeeth I have already mentioned that carry that meaning are apparent and manifest — and Ahlus-Sunnah have agreed (ijmā’) that a ruler is not to be removed due to his sin. As for the position stated in the books of fiqh that some of our colleagues hold, that he is to be removed; and what is cited from Mu’tazilah then the one who says it is wrong and he is an opposer of the ijmā’. And the Scholars have stated: ‘The reason why it is forbidden to remove the ruler and it is prohibited to rebel against him is because of the fact that it leads to fitan (tribulations), the spilling of blood, discord and corruption between the people. And the corruption that arrises in removing him is greater than him remaining in place.” (See Sharhun-Nawawi ‘ala Sahīh Muslim, 12/317)<br /><br />Ibn Hajr Al-Asqalāni (died 852H) stated: “The rebellion of a group from the Salaf against the tyrannical ruler, then that was before the establishment of the ijmā’ that prohibited rebellion against the oppressive ruler.” (See Mirqāt Al-Mafāteeh Sharh Mishkāt, 2/181).<br />He also stated (Fathul-Bāri 13/7): “Ibn Battāl said: In the hadeeth is proof forbidding revolt against the ruler, even if he is tyrannical. The scholars (fuqahā) are in agreement (ijmā’) upon the obligation of obeying the ruler who came into power by conquest; it is obligatory [therafter] to make jihād alongside him, and obedience to him is better than rebelling against him… and the scholars made no exception to this [ijmā’] except if the ruler disbelieves openly and clearly. In that case, there is no obedience to him. Rather it is obligatory to strive to oust him for the one who has the ability.”<br /><br />Al-Qādi Iyyad said: ‘It is said: This differing was only in the beginning. Then the consensus (ijmā’) was established that forbade rebellion against the rulers.‘ And Allah knows best.” (Sharh An-Nawawi ‘alā Muslim, 12/318)<br /><br />Al-Fuḍayl b. ʿAyyāḍ – Allāh have mercy on him – said, “If I had one supplication that was going to be answered I would make it for the ruler (imām), for the wellbeing and righteousness of the imām means wellbeing for the land and its people.” Al-Dhahabī, Siyar Alām Al-Nubalā ` in his biography of Al-Fuḍayl b. ʿAyyāḍ<br /><br />Shaykh Al-Islām Al-Mujaddid, Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhāb (may Allah’s mercy be upon him, died 1206) stated: “The Imāms of all the Madhhabs are agreed upon the fact that whoever conquers a land or lands, he takes the role of rulership in all matters. And the greatest of these matters is that it is a must to withhold from rebellion against him. And if this was not the case, then the worldly affairs would not be settled. And the people for a very long time right up until this day have not united behind one leader. And it is not known that any of the scholars stated that the Sharī’ah laws are not valid except with a single ruler ruling over the Muslims.” (See Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah, 59/5, Al-Fatāwa wal-Masā’il, 3/67)<br /><br />Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah’s mercy be upon him, died 1420H) stated: “The Salaf were united upon the belief that it is forbidden to revolt against the rulers regardless of whether they are righteous or wicked.” (Sharh As-Siyāsah Ash-Shar’iyyah, p. 92)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46543">AbuAbdurRahman</a> — Sat Sep 05, 2020 5:51 pm</p><hr />

Here we will share Ahadeeth, statements of the Salaf and the Ulema, both classical and contemporary on the issue of rebelling against the leader even if he is an oppressor and will prove that is impermissible to do so. <br /><br />If you have any evidences you wish to add that haven't been mentioned below, please add them and include a reference of where the statement can be found. The post will not be approved if a reference is not provided.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Evidences from the Sunnah</strong><br /><br />The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Whoever intends to advise one with authority, he should not do so publicly. Rather, he should take him by the hand and advise him in private. If he accepts the advice, all is well. If he does not accept it, he has fulfilled his duty.” Source: Musnad Aḥmad 14909 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani<br /><br />Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you, who invoke God's blessings upon you and you invoke His blessings upon them. And the worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and who hate you and whom you curse and who curse you. It was asked (by those present): Shouldn't we overthrow them with the help of the sword? He said: No, as long as they establish prayer among you. If you then find anything detestable in them. You should hate their administration, but do not withdraw yourselves from their obedience. - Sahih Muslim 1855<br /><br />Umm Salama (wife of the Holy Prophet) that he said: Leaders will be appointed over you, and you will find them doing good as well as bad deeds. One who hates their bad deeds is absolved from blame. One who disapproves of their bad deeds is (also) safe (so far as Divine wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them (is doomed). People asked: Messenger of Allah, shouldn't we FIGHT against them? He replied: No, as long as they say their prayer. &quot;Hating and disapproving&quot; refers to liking and disliking from the heart - Sahih Muslim 1854.<br /><br />Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One who found in his Leader something which he disliked should hold his patience, for one who separated from the main body of the Muslims even to the extent of a handspan and then he died would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyya - Sahih Muslim 1849<br /><br />Simak who said: Ash'ath b. Qais pulled him (Salama b. Yazid) when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &quot;Listen to them (leaders) and obey them, for on them shall be the burden of what they do and on you shall be the burden of what you do.&quot; - Sahih Muslim 1846<br /><br />Abu Dharr who said: &quot;My friend (i. e. the Holy Prophet) advised me to listen (to the man in position of authority) and obey (him) even if he were a slave maimed (and disabled).&quot; - Sahih Muslim 1837<br /><br />Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &quot;It is obligatory for you to listen to the ruler and obey him in adversity and prosperity, in pleasure and displeasure, and even when another person is given preference over you.” - Sahih Muslim 1836<br /><br />It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Holy prophet (ﷺ) said: &quot;Whoso obeys me obeys God, and whoso disobeys me disobeys God. Whoso obeys the leader obeys me, and whoso disobeys the leader disobeys me.&quot; - Sahih Muslim 1835<br /><br />Messenger of Allah said: Rulers after me will come who do not follow my guidance and my tradition (sunnah). Some of their men will have the hearts of devils in a human body. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what should I do if I live to see that time?”<br />The Prophet said: You should listen and obey them even if the ruler strikes your back and takes your wealth, even still listen and obey.

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم <br /><br />Some people cite the following statement of Sh.Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab (rahimahullah) as evidence to say that the sheikh declared the muslims of his time, including his own teachers, as kuffar.<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab (may Allah have mercy upon him) states:<br /><br />وأنا أخبركم عن نفسي والله الذي لا إله إلا هو لقد طلبت العلم واعتقد من عرفني أن لي معرفة وأنا ذلك الوقت لا أعرف معنى لا إله إلا الله، ولا أعرف دين الإسلام قبل هذا الخير الذي من الله به. وكذلك مشايخي ما منهم رجل عرف ذلك، فمن زعم من علماء العارض أنه عرف معنى لا إله إلا الله أو عرف معنى الإسلام قبل هذا الوقت أو زعم عن مشايخه أن أحداً عرف ذلك فقد كذب وافترى ولبس على الناس ومدح نفسه بما ليس فيه<br /><br />“And I inform you about myself –I swear by Allah whom there is none worthy of worship except Him– I have sought knowledge and those who knew me believed that I had knowledge while I did not know the meaning of La Ilaha illallah at that time and did not know the religion of Islam before this grace that Allah favored. <strong><em>As well as my teachers (Mashayikh) no one among them knew that</em></strong>. And if someone from the scholars of al-‘Aridh (the lands of Najd and surrounding areas) claims that he knew the meaning of La Ilaha illallah or knew the meaning of Islam before this time, or claims on behalf of his teachers that someone from them knew that, <strong><em>then he has lied and said falsehood and deceived the people and praise himself with something he does not possess</em></strong>.”<br /><br />-[Durar as-saniya 10/51]<br /><br />The answer:<br /><br />A few points to bare in mind:<br /><br />● Context is key in any piece of information one reads. You have to read what comes before a paragraph or what comes after it. Even after that, look at the historical context and situation in which this information is being relayed. Why did the author say this? Upon what grounds did he write this? Who was he refering to? What else did he say in other places in regards to this issue? All of this must be examined. If you have done so then you'll have your answer. Speaking from an academic point of view, such a citation of a statement like that along with drawing ones own conclusion is a fail, with all due respect. <br /><br />● Now, this statement. The Sheikh is refering to his personal experience when it comes to seeking knowledge, he highlights how he didnt know the reality of the meaning of the shahaadah, or the reality of Islam. This is what is understood from his speech if you are familiar with his writing methods and explanations. It doesnt mean he makes takfir of himself or others. Rather he's saying that he didnt know the reality of the meaning of tawheed. And this is somewhat of his display of humility! How many people are brought up in secular, liberal or non-religious cultural dominanted societies that dont emphasise religion thus resulting in many people not knowing the true reality of their religion? This is widespread amongst many muslims. They dont know the reality/rulings or intricates of Islam nor its sciences. This is what Sh.Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab is trying to argue and say, especially in regards to the affairs of Tawheed. For anyone who knows the reality of Najd in his time and locality will definitley understand what he said and meant. <br /><br />An example that can be given is the statement of Allah to His messenger (peace be upon him): &quot;And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants.&quot; -42:52. This doesnt mean the prophet (peace be upon him) wasnt a muslim. But rather the details of the book and imaan were not revealed to him previously. Sh.Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab grew up in a society where they lacked in their belief of Tawheed, and Shirk was prevalent. One must read the history.<br /><br />● Sh.Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab (rahimahullah) has refuted and rebutted erroneous claims levelled against him that he makes mass-takfir of the Muslims. And that the people were kuffar for 600 years until he came. He replies to these allegations as being false and untrue, while reciting the verse &quot;Glory be to You (O Allah) this is a great slander!&quot; As a great example, read his letter titled &quot;A letter to the people of Qaseem&quot; in which he clarifies his beliefs and dispells more than several doubts surrounding his dawah.<br /><br />● The comment itself is self explanatory about who he is refering to. The people of al-'Aridh who were engulfed in major Shirk and innovation at the time. They didnt know the reality of Tawheed, this also requires historical reading in order for you to understand the background to the sheiks speech. <br /><br />● The Sheikh isnt refering to all his teachers. This is logically incorrect since he learned Tawheed from them and took much advice and counsel when writing his work (Kitab at-Tawheed), from these Sheikhs is the likes of Muhammad Hayaat as-Sindi and Muhammad al-Majmu'i. It would also contradict his other statements that say the exact opposite! One must not look at a statement in isolation, but rather in a fuller context and indepth reading. Who he is refering to are those who, at the start of his seeking knowledge, were engrossed in Shirk and innovation, and they themselves didnt realise it.<br /><br />Much more can be said, but I hope this suffices. I will post other statements from the Sheikh in clarification and refutation of many doubts spread about him. Along with his innocence from the crime of wrongful takfir he has been charged with. May Allah grant us all beneficial knowledge, ameen.<br /><br />For more informarion, please read the following:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.al-jasem.com/archives/2262">http://www.al-jasem.com/archives/2262</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.al-jasem.com/archives/2236">http://www.al-jasem.com/archives/2236</a><!-- m --><br /><br />-AbuAbdillah Ehsan<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46547">AbuAbdillah</a> — Thu Jul 02, 2020 6:20 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Issues of Takfeer</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Question: Is it upon everyone to unrestrictedly apply these rulings (i.e. regarding the issue of Ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed) or should this affair be referred back to its people (i.e. the scholars)?</em><br /><br />ash-Shaikh ‘Abdul Aziz Rajihee حفظه الله:»<br /><br />These matters should be returned back to the scholars for they are ones who will study them and reflect on them. The common folk and the students should refer to the scholars in this regard and it is not for them to issue rulings in these matters because they have not completed the time span of their studies. As for the common folk, then they are not qualified for this. And as for the students (of knowledge), then they too must reference the scholars and not issue rulings, making takfeer based on vain desires. Perhaps a person may get little knowledge, memorizing the Qur’aan and such, then he starts to issue rulings making takfeer of people. This is not for him – he must return it back to the scholars. This is because he may think something to be disbelief when in fact it is not and this is due to his minimal knowledge, little insight and hastiness in issuing rulings. <br /><br />[An Explanation of The Nullifiers of Islam by Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab explained by ash-Shaikh al-‘Allammah ‘Abdul Aziz Rajihee حفظه الله]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 1:32 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Blame Ourselves or Blame the Rulers</span></strong><br />Imaam Ibnul Qayyim / Dr Saleh as Saleh<br /><br />Listen / Download Mp3 Here (Time 10:04)<br />[audio <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/blame-on-us-or-blame-on-rulers-imaam-ibnul-qayyim-saleh-as-saleh.mp3">https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com ... -saleh.mp3</a><!-- m -->]<br /><br />Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) talked about what people think is the fitnah of “our times”, i.e. meaning his own times, but this applies just as well to the contemporary fitnah of our own times. About the ways of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) in this creation vis-a-vis the rulers and the ruled, he said :<br /><br />“And contemplate Allaah’s (Azza wa Jal) Wisdom when He made people of authority, making them a reflection of the ruled. It is as if the deeds of the ruled appear in the form and deeds of their rulers :<br /><br /><ul>    if the ruled are upright, then their rulers will be upright<br /><br />    if the ruled incline away from uprightness, then their rulers will do the same to them<br /><br />    if the ruled transgress and oppress, then their rulers will do the same to them<br /><br />    if there appears deception and plotting from the ruled, then it will be the same from their rulers<br /><br />    if the ruled take away the rights of the people and become miser as to the rights of others, then their rulers will do the same to them and deprive them of their rights<br /><br />    if the ruled take away from the oppressed /weak among them that which they deserve not to take in their transactions with them, then their rulers will do that towards the ruled’s wealth and take what they deserve not, and impose on the ruled taxes and assignments<br /><br />    and whenever the ruled take from the oppressed and weak unjustly, then their rulers will do the same to them and take it by force<br /><br />    so the actions of the ruled appear in the actions of the rulers and it is not in the Divine Wisdom that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) assigns authority over the wicked and evils ones, EXCEPT to the ones who are of their own kind<br /><br />    Since the first generation was of the best generation and of the most righteous, … so were their leaders righteous<br /><br />    It is not befitting Allaah’s Wisdom that in “our times” (Ibnul Qayyim’s times) that those assigned to authority over us be the like of Muawwiya and ‘Umar bin ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, not to mention Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. The leaders of those before us were in accordance with their own conditions and ranks. Our leaders are in accordance with our own condition and rank. In both cases, this is entailed by the Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal).”</ul><br />Such is the conclusion of Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullah) concerning his times, i.e. the 8th century A.H., so what do you think about our own times?<br /><br />The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) pertains to His Attributes. He puts things in accordance with His Hikmah and puts them in their proper places with what fits. The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has a noble and most perfect objective.<br /><br />As for those who hasten in making these roads for “deliverance” and see getting rid of the rulers as the solution to their problems, they confuse symptoms and disease.<br /><br />The rulers are seen as being the causes when in reality they are only the symptoms. The true illness is within the ruled. Therefore, all endeavors towards finding a solution should focus on the ruled themselves.<br /><br />The deeds of the ruled are reflected in the deeds of the people having authority over them. When the people are not ready and are away from the deen of Allaah, who would you expect them to deserve as rulers?<br /><br />Contemplate this very carefully!<br /><br />Dr Saleh As-Saleh(rahimahullaah)<br /><br />Posted from : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://understand-islam.net/site/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=110">http://understand-islam.net/site/index. ...

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Advising The Rulers Is In Conformity With The Shareeaah</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Allaamah Dr. Saalih al-Fawzaan</span></strong> was asked,<em> &quot;You and your brothers from the ulemaa in this country are Salafiyoon, and all praise is due to Allaah, and your way in advising the rulers in is conformity with the Shareeaah as the Messenger (sallallaahualaihi wasallam) has clarified, and we do not purify anyone above Allaah. And there are some people who criticise you for not publicly rejecting the mistakes, which occur (from the rulers). And others excuse you and say that you are under pressure from the state. So do you have something to say by way of guidance and clarification for these people?&quot;</em> <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh replied</span></strong>, &quot;There is no doubt that the rulers, like other than them from mankind, are not infallible from error, so advising them is obligatory. However trying to reach out to them from the gatherings and the pulpits is considered to be the impermissible backbiting and it is a greater evil than the evil which emanates from the rulers because it is backbiting, and due to the fact that it implants fitnah and splitting of the ranks and it impacts the spreading of the dawah. <br /><br />So it is obligatory to convey the advice to them by reliable means, not by exposition and spreading. As for attacking the ulemaa of this land by saying that they do not advise or that they are suppressed, then this is a false accusation by which the separation between the ulemaa and the people and the society is intended such that is easy for the one who intends corruption to implant his evil. This is because when bad thoughts about the ulemaa are spread, then the confidence in the ulemaa is lost and there arises an opportunity for those who have desires and intentions to spread their poison. <br /><br /><em>source: Al-Ijaabaat al-Muhimmah fee Mashaakil il-Mudlahimmah</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2017 2:21 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Solution For This Ummah Is Not By Simply Changing The Rulers</span></strong><br /><br />We have an example in Barak Obama, the president of United States of America. The guy who received the Noble peace prize in the very first year of his being elected but could not do anything about gun control and violence in his own country. The guy who is himself a black, but could not do much to remove the racial hatred towards the blacks and other races in his own country. The guy whose party slogan was “Yes we can” (bring about the changes), but what happened? The only change we see is towards the worse as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<br /><br /><em><ul>❝No time will come upon you but the time following it will be worse than it.❞</ul></em><br /><br />When people went to Anas رضي الله عنه complaining about the wrong they were suffering at the hands of al-Hajjaaj, this when Anas رضي الله عنه narrated to them that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ❝Be patient…❞ (and the rest of the Hadeeth is as mentioned above) [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (7068)]<br /><br />Change does not come by changing the rulers. Change comes when we change ourselves for the better, as Allaah تعالى said:<br /><br /><em><ul>إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ ۗ وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّـهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَالٍ<br /><br />❝{Verily! Allaah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allaah wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector}❞ [Surah al-Ra`d (13): 11]</ul></em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">What we learn here is:</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>1) The good state of the people will not change as long as they are righteous and pious.<br /><br />2) When they turn towards the evil and disobedience, their state changes towards the worse and the blessings of Allaah is taken from them.<br /><br />3) Our sins are our own worst enemies.<br /><br />4) We cannot expect the rulers to be pious while we are ourselves sinning.<br /><br />5) When Allaah decrees His punishment, then there is no turning it back.<br /><br />6) None can benefit us against Allaah, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had said: ❝And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allaah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allaah had already prescribed against you.❞<br /><br />7) Don’t rely on your strength for the desired change, become righteous and ask Allaah for it, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ❝If you ask, then ask Allaah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allaah [alone].❞<br /><br />8) If there is something in the rulers which is not to our likings, then we should be patient and supplicate to Allaah that He guides them or deals with them.</ul><br />Ibn Khaldoon (d. 808 H) mentioned in his Taareekh: “The first one to pray for the Khaleefah on the Minbar was Ibn `Abbaas رضي الله عنهما; he prayed for `Alee رضي الله عنه in his Khutbah while he was in Basrah working as a dignitary for `Alee. He said: “O Allaah! Assist `Alee to be firm upon the truth and make his actions based upon that.” [Taareekh Ibn Khaldoon (1/332)]]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Through your prayers Allaah تعالى will bring about the changes which your swords cannot accomplish.</span></strong><br /><br />- Mu'adh Bin Farooq<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2017 2:18 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Advice of Imam Wahab ibn Munabih To a Man Affected by the Thought of the Khawarij</span></strong><br /><em>By Imam Wahab ibn Munabih</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Researched By Shaykh ‘Abdus Salaam bin Burjis Aal‘AbdulKareem May Allaah have mercy upon him</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Contents:</span></strong><br /><br /><ul> - Introduction<br /> - The Biography of the Imam Wahab ibn Munabih<br /> - Advice to the Khawarij</ul><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Introduction</span></strong><br /><br />All praise belongs to Allaah, may the peace and prayers of Allaah be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">To Proceed:</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed the Khawarij are an evil people, inviters to Fitnah and a flag of separation. The affairs of the Muslims have never been in order and together except that the task of the Khawarij has been to tear this order apart and corrupt what has been rectified.<br /><br />The presence of the Khawarij has been continuous since they first appeared. There has never been a period of time that has seen their absence until such time as the last of the Khawarij will rebel along with the Dajjal.<br /><br />There are many recurring ahadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- warning against them and clarifying their characteristics and Allaah’s ruling regarding them. This is why the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – fought against them, as did the rulers who came after them, throughout all periods of Islamic history.<br /><br />Even Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Uthmaan bin Affan was not saved from their attacks and evil plots, neither was Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib nor was Ameer ul-Mumineen Muawiyyah bin Abee Sufyaan – RadhiAllaahu anhum ajmaeen. The Khalifah Umar bin Abdul Azeez -Rahimullaah- was not saved from them, they rebelled against him…… so in reality they are the enemies of the people of Islaam and they are not pleased with any one of the Muslims ruling, no matter how good he is.<br /><br />Even the Messenger of Allaah – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was not saved from their attacks, to the extent that their leader Dhul-Khawaysira said to him: ‘Be just O Muhammad’ whereby he attacked the character of Allaah’s Messenger – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.<br /><br />The Khawarij in every time and place have a similarity in resemblance, so their hearts, their tongues and their actions are similar.<br /><br />This booklet, which I have extracted from the biography of the Imaam Wahab ibn Munabih -Rahimullaah, clearly explains their description as, in that time, the Khawarij exhibited the issues for which they have become well-known:<br /><br /><ul>a) Their view of the impermissibility of paying Zakat to the rulers of the Muslims; this was due to their declaration of Takfeer on the Muslim ruler and their claim that the Muslim rulers did not spend the Zakat in its proper place.</ul><br /><ul>b) Their not seeking forgiveness for the one who does not hold their views because they hold such a person to be a disbeliever in Allaah The Great.</ul><br />So those affected by these false claims were those who had little knowledge such that they were deceived by the Zuhud (abstention from loving worldly things), worship and severity in Deen of the Khawarij.<br /><br />From amongst those affected by the Khawarij was an elderly and wealthy man from the people of Yemen, but when Allaah Ta’ala intended good for him, He led him to the Imaam Wahab ibn Munabih –Rahimullaah. Imaam Wahab informed this man of their condition and warned him about their corrupt ideas and their danger to a man’s religious and worldly affairs. He did all this in a clear way, supported by evidences, which are easily understood by those of sound comprehension.<br /><br />If you reflect upon what the Khawarij used to propagate during that period and also at this time, the saying of Allaah Ta’ala springs to mind:<br /><ul>تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا الآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Their hearts are alike; We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:118]</ul><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Biography of the Imam Wahab ibn Munabih</span></strong><br /><br />He is: Wahab ibn Munabih bin Kaamil bin Seej bin Dhi Kibaar Abu Abdullaah al-Yamaani as-Sanaani. His father came to Yemen from Khurasaan from Haraat.<br /><br />Wahab was born in the year 34 A.H. during the Khilafah of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan – radiAllaahu anhu.<br /><br />Wahab narrated on the authority of a group of the Companions, including Anas bin Maalik, Jaabir bin Abdullaah, Abdullaah bin ‘Abbas, Abdullaah ibn Umar, Abu Huraira and Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri.<br /><br />He also narrated on the authority of: Tawoos bin Kaysaan, ‘Amroo bin Dinaar, ‘Amroo bin Shuaib, his own brother Hamaam bin Munabih and others.<br /><br />Imaam Ahmad said: ‘He was from the children of Persia.’ Then he said: ‘Everyone from the people of Yemen who had the word ‘Dhi’ in his name was from the Shareef (from Bani Hashim), it is said: so-and-so has ‘Dhi’, and so and so has no ‘Dhi’.’[2]<br /><br />Al-Ijaali said: He was a Tabi’ee (a successor of the Companions), trustworthy and he used to be a judge in Sana’.[3]<br /><br />Abu Zurah, an-Nisaee and others regarded him as trustworthy.<br /><br />He was a judge for Umar bin AbdulAzeez –Rahimullaah- in Sana’[4] and his hadeeth are to be found in Bukhari and Muslim. He had much knowledge of the People of the Book and he is counted as being from amongst the Zuhaad (those who abstain from loving worldly things) and the people of piety who would worship plentifully.<br /><br />He died in the year 110 A.H. in Sana’ at the beginning of the Khilafah of Hisham bin Abdul Malik. It has been said that he died in the year 114 A.H. and Yaqoot deems this to be the stronger opinion in ‘Mu’ajam al-Udaba’.[5]<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Abdus Salaam bin Burjis Aal ‘AbdulKareem<br />6/6/1418 A.H.</span></em></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Advice to the Khawarij</span></span></strong><br /><br />‘Alee bin al-Madinee said: Hisham bin Yusuf as-Sanaani Abu AbdurRahmaan the Qaadi of Sana’ narrated to us, that he said I was told by Daawood bin Qays that he said:<br /><br />I had a friend from the house of Kholaan from the city of Hadoor, who was called Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan.<br /><br />I left Sana’ heading towards his village, as I came closer to his village I found a book which had stamped on its back: To Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan.<br /><br />When I reached him, I found him disturbed and saddened, so I asked him why, he said: A messenger came from Sana’ and mentioned that some friends of mine wrote a book and sent it to me and the messenger lost it. So I sent one of my slaves with him to search for it between my village and Sana’ and they did not find it, so I was concerned about it.<br /><br />I said: Here is the book, I have just found it.<br /><br />He said: ‘Praise be to Allaah who has made you find it.’ He opened it and began to read.<br /><br />I said: Read it to me.<br /><br />He said: Indeed I am younger than you in age.<br /><br />I said: What is it?<br /><br />He said: It is about striking necks.<br /><br />I said: Perhaps those who wrote it are the people of al-Haroora who wrote regarding the Zakat (obligatory charity) of the ruler?<br /><br />He said: From where do you know them?<br /><br />I said: I and my friends sit with Wahab bin Munabih and he tells us: ‘Keep away from these gullible youth, these people of al-Haroora. You should take the opinion that opposes them, because they are the shameful ones of this Ummah.’<br /><br />He pushed the book towards me, so I read and found it said:<br /><br />Bismillah ar-Rahmanir – Raheem<br /><br />To Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan<br /><br />Peace be upon you.<br /><br />Indeed, we praise Allaah before you. There is no God except Him and we advise you with Taqwa of Allaah Alone, Who has no partner. Indeed the Deen of Allaah is guidance and the correct path in this world and it is salvation and success in the Hereafter. Indeed the Deen of Allaah is obedience to Allaah and it is opposition of that which goes against His Sharia’ and the Sunnah of His Prophet. So if this book of ours reaches you – if Allaah wills – then see to it that you give Allaah His right in what He has obligated upon you (Zakat). Give it to those who deserve the rule of Allaah and the rule of His ‘Aawliyaa (His close friends).<br /><br />And peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah.<br /><br />Then I said to him: Indeed, I warn you against them.<br /><br />He said: How can I follow what you say and leave the saying of the one who is older than you are?<br /><br />I said: Would you like me to take you to Wahaab bin Munabih, so that you can listen to what he has to say and he will tell you about them.<br /><br />He said: Yes.<br /><br />So I went to Sana’ and he came with me, then we proceeded until I took him to see Wahab bin Munabih. Masood bin ‘Auf was the ruler over Yemen appointed by Urwa bin Muhammad. ‘Alee bin al-Madini said: he is Urwa bin Muhammad bin ‘Ateeyah as-Saadi and he was preceded by Saad bin Bakr bin Hoowazin.<br /><br />We found a group of people who usually attended his gatherings, sitting with Wahab and some of them said to me: ‘Who is this Shaykh?’ I said: this is Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan from the people of Hadoor and he has need of Abu Abdullaah.<br /><br />They said: why don’t you mention it?<br /><br />I said: Indeed, he wants to consult him regarding a private matter.<br /><br />So the people left.<br /><br />Wahab said: ‘What is your need O Dhu-Kholaan?’<br /><br />Dhu-Kholaan began to speak but he mixed up his words and became scared to speak.<br /><br />Wahaab said to me: ‘Speak on behalf of your Shaykh.’<br /><br />So I said: Yes O Abu Abdullaah, verily Dhu-Kholaan is from the people of the Qur’aan and the people of righteousness, from what we know and Allaah is more knowledgeable about his personal affairs. He has informed me, that he came across a group of people from Sana’ who are from the people of Haroora and that they said to him: The Zakat that you give to the rulers is not compensated by Allaah as reward for you because the rulers do not spend it in its rightful place. So, you should give it to us, verily we will spend it in its rightful place – we will divide it amongst the poor Muslims and we will implement the Islamic punishments.<br /><br />I thought that your speech O Abu Abdullaah would be more satisfactory to him than mine. He has mentioned to me that he gives them the harvests of one hundred Firqan (a quantity) on his riding animals and he sends it with his slave.<br /><br />So, Wahab said to him: O Dhu-Kholaan do you wish to become a Harooreey now you have become old and ascribe misguidance to one who is better than you? What will you say to Allaah tomorrow when you stand in front of Him?<br /><br />The one you testify against, Allaah testifies that he has Emaan while you testify that he has committed kufr. Allaah testifies that he is guided while you testify that he is misguided? So where will you be if your opinion is opposed by the command of Allaah and your testification is opposed by the testification of Allaah.<br /><br />Tell me O Dhu-Kholaan what do they say to you?<br /><br />So Dhu-Kholaan then spoke and he said to Wahab: They order me not to give Sadaqa (charity) except to those who hold their opinion and not to seek forgiveness except for them.<br /><br />Wahab said: you have spoken the truth, this is their false love.<br /><br />As for their statement about charity then indeed it has reached me that the Messenger of Allaah – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – mentioned a woman from the people of Yemen who entered the Fire due to her keeping a cat tied up, she neither fed it nor set it free to eat from the insects of the land.[6] So, is a person who worships Allaah, says that Allaah is Alone and does not associate anything with Him, more beloved to Allaah and worthier of being fed due to hunger or a cat?<br /><br />And Allaah says in His Book:<br /><br /><ul>وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَاء وَلَا شُكُوراً إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً<br /><br />&lt;&lt; And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to Miskin (poor), the orphan, and the captive, (Saying): ‘We feed you seeking Allaah’s Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you. Verily, we fear from our Lord a Day, hard and distressful, that will make the faces look horrible (from extreme aversion to it).’ &gt;&gt; [al-Insaan: 8-10]</ul><br />He also mentions a difficult and angry day for the sinners due to Allaah’s wrath upon them.<br /><br /><ul>فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً وَجَزَاهُم بِمَا صَبَرُوا جَنَّةً وَحَرِيراً مُتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ لَا يَرَوْنَ فِيهَا شَمْساً وَلَا زَمْهَرِيراً وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَالُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً وَيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِم بِآنِيَةٍ مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَأَكْوَابٍ كَانَتْ قَوَارِيرَا قَوَارِيرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ قَدَّرُوهَا تَقْدِيراً وَيُسْقَوْنَ فِيهَا كَأْساً كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنجَبِيلاً عَيْناً فِيهَا تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلاً وَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَانٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ إِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ حَسِبْتَهُمْ لُؤْلُؤاً مَّنثُوراً وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيماً وَمُلْكاً كَبِيراً عَالِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ وَحُلُّوا أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ وَسَقَاهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَاباً طَهُوراً إِنَّ هَذَا كَانَ لَكُمْ جَزَاء وَكَانَ سَعْيُكُم مَّشْكُوراً<br /><br />&lt;&lt; So Allaah saved them from the evil of that Day and gave them Nadratan (a light of beauty) and joy. And their recompense shall be Paradise and silken garments, because they were patient. Reclining therein on raised thrones, they will see there neither the excessive heat of the sun, nor the excessive bitter cold, (as in Paradise there is no sun and no moon). And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach. And amongst them will be passed around vessels of silver and cups of crystal, Crystal-clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof according to their wishes. And they will be given to drink there a cup (of wine) mixed with Zanjabîl (ginger, etc.). A spring there, called Salsabîl. And round about them will (serve) boys of everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls. And when you look there (in Paradise), you will see a delight (that cannot be imagined) and a great dominion. Their garments will be of fine green silk and gold embroidery. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their Lord will give them a pure drink. (And it will be said to them): ‘Verily, this is a reward for you and your endeavour has been accepted.’&gt;&gt; [al-Insaan: 11-22]</ul><br />Then Wahab said: Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala continuously describes what He has prepared for them of the blessings of Paradise.<br /><br />Then he said: As for their saying: ‘Forgiveness is not to be sought except for the one who holds their opinion.’ Are they better than the Angels?<br /><br />And Allaah Ta’ala says in the Soorah of &lt;&lt;Ha-Mim, Ayeen, Seen, Qaaf&gt;&gt;:<br /><br /><ul>وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ<br /><br />&lt;&lt; The angels glorify the praises of their Lord and ask for forgiveness for those on the earth&gt;&gt; [Shuraa’: 5]</ul><br />And I swear by Allaah that the Angels could not do this by themselves nor could they do this unless they were ordered because Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;They speak not until He has spoken and they act on His Command&gt;&gt;<br /><br />[Al-Anbiyya: 27]</ul><br />Allaah has affirmed this Ayaat in Soorah &lt;&lt; Ha mim…. &gt;&gt;[Shuraa’]<br /><br />and it is explained in the major Soorah &lt;&lt; Ha mim &gt;&gt;[Ghafir] where He said:<br /><br /><ul>الَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ الْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe&gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 7]</ul><br />Do you not see O Dhu-Kholaan that I lived at the beginning times of Islaam and I swear by Allaah that the Khawarij did not have a group except that Allaah divided them because of their evil condition. Not one of the Khawarij came out with this opinion except that Allaah struck his neck and none of the Ummah ever gathered together under one man of the Khawarij.<br /><br />If Allaah had given the Khawarij strength in their opinion, the world would have become corrupt and the highways would have been cut off, Hajj to the House of Allaah the Haraam would have stopped and the matter of Islaam would have returned to Jahileeyah, so much so that the people would seek help from mountain peaks as they used to in Jahileeyah.<br /><br />Then there would stand more than ten or twenty men and there would not be a single one from amongst them except that he would call for Khilaafah for himself. With every one of these men there would be more than 10,000 people fighting each other, each group would testify to the disbelief of the other group until a believing man would become fearful for his self, his religion, his blood, his family and his wealth, he would not know which way to go, nor would he know whom he should be with.<br /><br />However, Allaah has decided for this Ummah with His command, knowledge and mercy and He makes the best decision for them. He united them and placed love in their hearts for one man who was not from the Khawarij.<br /><br />So Allaah protected their blood through him, covered up their and their offspring’s shortcomings and gathered all their different factions together through this one man. He made their highways safe and fought the enemy through this man even if it was only for the sake of the Muslims’ honour. He established the Islaamic punishments by way of him, justly judged the oppressed and strove against the oppressors. This man was a mercy from Allaah and he had mercy upon them due to the Mercy of Allaah.<br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala said in His Book:<br /><br /><ul>وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ اللّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَّفَسَدَتِ الأَرْضُ وَلَـكِنَّ اللّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt; And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of Bounty to all that exists &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 251]</ul><br /><ul>وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعاً وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَاناً وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah and be not divided among yourselves. And remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together so that, by His Grace, you became brethren and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire and He saved you from it. Thus Allaah makes His Ayaat clear to you, that you may be guided. &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan:103]</ul><br />And Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْأَشْهَادُ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world’s life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, (i.e. Day of Resurrection)&gt;&gt;<br />[Ghafir: 51]</ul><br />So where do they stand from the point of view of these Ayaat? If they were believers they would have been made victorious.<br /><br />And He Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَالِبُونَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our slaves, the Messengers, that they verily would be made triumphant and that Our hosts, they verily would be the victors. &gt;&gt;<br />[Saffat 171-173]</ul><br />So if they were the soldiers of Allaah they would have had victory in Islaam even if it was just once.<br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ رُسُلاً إِلَى قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَاؤُوهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنَ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا وَكَانَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;And indeed We did send Messengers before you to their own people. They came to them with clear proofs, then We took vengeance on those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with Allaah, sins, etc.) and (as for) the believers it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). &gt;&gt;<br />[Room :47]</ul><br />So if they were believers they would have been made victorious.<br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُم فِي الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُم مِّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئاً<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds that He will certainly grant them succession in the earth as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after fear, provided they worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. &gt;&gt;<br />[Noor: 55]</ul><br />So where do they stand in this regard? Are any one of them better informed about the Islaam from the days of Umar bin al-Khattab, when they are without a Khalifah or Jamaah and are without insight?<br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it superior over all religions &gt;&gt; [ Taubah: 33]</ul><br />I testify that Allaah has fulfilled what He had promised the ahl-us-Sunnah giving them aid, strength and victory over their enemies and those who oppose the opinion of their Jamaah.<br /><br />Wahab said: Has not what sufficed Ahl-ul-Tawheed, Ahl-ul-Qibla and the people who have accepted the rulings of Islaam – the Sunnan practices and obligations of Islaam – sufficed you O Dhu-Kholaan? that which sufficed the Prophet of Allaah Nuh in response to the idol-worshippers and Kuffar, when his people said to him:<br /><br /><ul>قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ لَكَ وَاتَّبَعَكَ الْأَرْذَلُونَ قَالَ وَمَا عِلْمِي بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ إِنْ حِسَابُهُمْ إِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّي لَوْ تَشْعُرُون<br /><br />&lt;&lt;They said: “Shall we believe in you, when the meanest (of the people) follow you?” He said: “And what knowledge have I of what they used to do?” Their account is only with my Lord, if you could (but) know. &gt;&gt; [Shu’araa 111-113]</ul><br />Are you not satisfied with what sufficed Allaah’s Prophet and friend Ibraheem in replying to the worshippers of idols, when he said:<br /><br /><ul>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِناً وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ النَّاسِ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ<br /><br />&lt;&lt;And (remember) when Ibraheem said: “O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me and whoso disobeys me, – still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” &gt;&gt; [Ibraheem :35 -36]</ul><br />Does not what sufficed Prophet Isa’ with the Kuffar – who took him as a god other than Allaah – suffice you O Dhu-Kholaan? Verily Allaah is pleased, until the Day of Judgement, with the sayings of Nuh, Ibraheem and Isa’ which the believers and those who come after them follow, by which I mean:<br /><br /><ul>إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ<br /><br />&lt;&lt; “If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily You, only You are The All­-Mighty, The All-­Wise.” &gt;&gt; [Maida: 118]</ul><br />They (the believers) do not oppose the sayings of the Prophets of Allaah with their opinion, so whom will you follow, if you do not follow the Book of Allaah and the sayings and opinions of His Prophets?<br /><br />Know, that your coming to see me is mercy for you if you have heard my speech and have accepted my advice to you. This is evidence against you tomorrow, when you meet Allaah, if you leave the Book of Allaah and return to the opinion of the Huroora.<br /><br />Dhu-Kholaan said: So what do you command me to do?<br /><br />Wahab said: As for your obligatory Zakat, then give it to the one whom Allaah has placed as a ruler over the affairs of this Ummah, and has gathered the people with him.<br /><br />This is because the Dominion, indeed, is from Allaah Alone and it is in His Hand, He gives it to whom He wills and He takes it away from whom He wills. So he to whom Allaah gives rulership, none has the ability to take it away from him.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Advice About Rulers &amp; Ruling</span></strong><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1 – The desire for leadership</span></strong><br /><br />Al-Muhalab said:<br /><br />‘Desiring leadership is the reason for people to fight over leadership. So much so that blood is spilt and peoples’ wealth &amp; chastity is regarded lawful for taking and evil and corruption is prevalent.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Fath al-Bari’ by Ibn Hajr 13/135]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 – Rebellions Begin by Criticizing the Rulers</span></strong><br /><br />It is mentioned in ‘Tareekh At-Tabari’ (4/341) that the Jew Abdullaah ibn Saba used to say:<br /><br />‘Begin by criticizing and attacking your leaders.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Scholars are Pressurised by the Rulers</span></strong><br /><em><br />Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan bin Abdullaah al-Fawzan was asked:<br /><br />‘Dear respected Shaykh, you and your brothers, the scholars of this country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) are Salafis, and praise belongs to Allaah- and your way of advising the rulers is according to the Sharia’, just as the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– explained – and we do not give anyone a status over and above the status that Allaah gives him. There are those who view, as a defect on your part, that you do not openly criticise violations that occur and there are those who make excuses for you and they say that indeed you are pressurised by the government. So do you have clarification and advice for these people?<br /><br />The Shaykh answered:<br /><br />‘There is no doubt that the rulers are like other humans, they are not infallible.  Advising them is an obligation however talking about them in gatherings and upon the Mimbar is regarded as prohibited backbiting.  This evil is greater than the evil that occurs from the rulers, because it is backbiting.<br /><br />This is also planting the seeds of Fitna, it causes disunity and it affects the path of Dawa’.<br /><br />Therefore, it is obligatory to convey advice to them in a reliable way, and not by publically defaming and spreading rumours.<br /><br />As for attacking the scholars of this country, that they do not advise the rulers or that they are helpless regarding what the rulers do, those people do this with the intent of separating the scholars from the youth and the society, by which they lay a path where the evil person can plant his evil. This is because if there is bad opinion of the scholars, trust in them may be lost and this presents an opportunity for partisan people to spread their poison.<br /><br />I believe that this scheming ideology has been introduced into this land and its people with foreign helpers, therefore it is obligatory for the Muslims to be wary of it.’<br /><br />[From: ‘Al-Ajwibah al-Mawfeedah’ (112)]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/the-scholars-are-pressurised-by-the-rulers/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... he-rulers/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 02, 2017 12:14 am</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=1042&amp;p=1101#p1101"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Khawaarij are the Murji‘ah</span></strong><br /><em>By Aboo ’Umar Usaamah al-’Utaybee</em><br /><br />Translation by Maaz Qureshi[1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE ORIGIN OF THE STATEMENT:</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed, statements have been mentioned from the Salafus-Saalih describing the Khawaarij as Murji‘ah, and conversely describing the Murji‘ah as Khawaarij. Rather, all of the people of innovation have been described as Khawaarij.<br /><br />Stated Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H) – rahimahullaah, “As for the Khawaarij, then they have named Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah as ‘Murji‘ah.’ And the Khawaarij have lied in their statement. Rather, they themselves are the Murji‘ah. They claim that they are upon eemaan and truth, to the exclusion of the rest of the people, and they declared whosoever opposed them as disbelievers.”[2]<br /><br />And Imaam Ahmad – rahimahullaah – also said, “Indeed, the Khawaarij are the Murji‘ah.”[3]<br /><br />And it was said to the Imaam, the Haafidh, ’Abdullaah Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H), “Do you hold the view of al-Irjaa‘?” So Ibnul-Mubaarak – rahimahullaah – replied, “How could I be a Murji‘ when I do not hold the sword?!”[4]<br /><br />And Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) – rahimahullaah – used to refer to all of the people of innovation as Khawaarij. He used to say, “The Khawaarij differ in name, but they are agreed upon the sword.”[5]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">WHAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THE BOOKS OF SECTS:</span></strong><br /><br />Stated Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) – rahimahullaah, “And from amongst them – that is, from amongst the Khawaarij – was a sect called the Shabeebiyyah. And that was because Shabeeb stopped with regards to Saalih and with regards to ar-Raaji’ah. So they said, ‘We do not know if what Saalih ruled was the truth, or if it was transgression. And we do not know if what ar-Raaji’ah testified to was the truth, or if it was transgression.’ So the Khawaarij freed themselves from these people and called them: Murji‘atul-Khawaarij.”[6]<br /><br />And ash-Shahrastaanee said, “And al-Yamaan mentioned that the Shabeebiyyah were called the Murji‘atul-Khawaarij when they came to a standstill with regards to the affair of Saalih. And this Saalih was Ibn Musrih, one of the heads of the Khawaarij.”[7]<br /><br />And ash-Shahrastaanee also stated, “And the Murji‘ah consist of four groups: <br /><em><ul>[i] Murji‘atul-Khawaarij; <br />[ii] Murji‘atul-Qadariyyah; <br />[iii] Murji‘atul-Jabariyyah; <br />[iv] Murji‘atul-Khaalisah.”[8]</ul></em><br /><br />Stated al-Isfaraayeenee (d.406H) – rahimahullaah, “There are three sects that make up the Murji‘ah. One sect from amongst them has combined between al-Irjaa‘ in eemaan and speaking of al-Qadr (divine pre-Decree), such as Abee Shimr, Muhammad Ibn Shabeeb al-Basree and al-Khaalidiyyah. So these are the Murji‘oon Qadariyyoon.”[9]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE BASIS FOR DESCRIBING THE KHAWAARIJJ WITH IRJAA‘:</span></strong><br /><br />Indeed, the Scholars of the past and present have mentioned the points due to which, the Khawaarij are described with al-Irjaa‘, from amongst them:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[1]:</span></strong> The Khawaarij have been described as Murji‘ah because they testify for themselves that they are upon complete eemaan and the whole truth. And they claim that whosoever opposes them, then he is a disbeliever void of eemaan and truth.<br /><br />Stated Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal – rahimahullaah – in explanation of the description of the Khawaarij with al-Irjaa‘, “They claim that they are upon eemaan and truth, to the exclusion of the rest of the people. And whosoever opposes them is declared a<br /><br />disbeliever.”[10] And it is well known that the person who says that he is a believer in truth, then he is an innovator. So this is from the statements of the Murji‘ah.<br /><br />Stated Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) – rahimahullaah, “Indeed, he detested that which was detested by the rest of the Scholars from the statement of the Murji‘ah when they said, that eemaan is the same amongst all the people who possess it, just as every person possesses a head. So one of them would say: I am a believer in truth, and I am a believer according to Allaah.”[11]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[2]:</span></strong> From the reasons due to which, the Khawaarij are described with al-Irjaa‘ is that they agree with the Murji‘ah in that eemaan is a single indivisible entity. It cannot be divided into parts, nor does it increase amongst those who possess it. So if some of it departs, then all of it has departed. This is from amongst the issues upon which the Khawaarij and the Murji‘ah have agreed. However, they differed with regards to the appellation of eemaan, what decreases it, increases it, causes a deficiency in it and what causes exclusion in it. So this point has already been clarified in that which has proceeded in the first point.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[3]:</span></strong> Some of the Khawaarij have been described with irjaa‘ (deferring, postponing) with regards to some of their opponents. So they do not rule upon them with eemaan, nor disbelief. They only defer (yarji‘oon) their affair, as has proceeded in the quotations from the books of sects with regards to theMurji‘ah and the Khawaarij.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[4]:</span></strong> And the Khawaarij of our times have been described with irjaa‘. Rather, they have been described with extremism (ghuluww) in it, due to their performing irjaa‘ with regards to those who are similar to them from amongst the innovators who agree with them in their takfeer of those who do not judge by what Allaah revealed. So you will find them performing takfeer upon some people due to major sins if this occurs amongst the common folk. However, when this happens amongst some of those whom they glorify, then they do not perform takfeer of them. Rather, they bear witness for their precedence, lofty rank and they make them examples!! So they glorify Sayyid Qutb (k.1966CE),[12] despite the fact that he fell into irjaa‘, cursing the Companions and performing takfeer upon some of them. He also spoke of hulool (belief that Allaah is everywhere) and al-jabr (believing that the creatures have no free will). So despite that, they consider him from amongst the major Scholars, they glorify him and describe him with that which obligates Paradise! Indeed, that is martyrdom!!<br /><br />Stated Shaykh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee – hafidhahullaahu wa ra’aahu – in speaking about the modern-day Khawaarij, “So indeed, they have opposed the Salaf in many important foundations, from them: …<br /><br />And from this opposition is their alliance with many of the people of innovation and their acceptance of their corrupted methodologies, and their books which are written with misguidance, yet they still spread them and defend them. And they drive the youth to drink from that, which has the most evil effects upon the Ummah and its youth; from takfeer, destruction, continued wars, spilling blood and abuse of the limbs.<br /><br />And from this opposition is that they use their desires to hurl themselves into the abyss of extreme irjaa‘ which takes one from mere negligence to larger innovations, then to that which reaches disbelieving innovations which lack any sense of Salafiyyah, nor any sense of honour for the Religion of Allaah and those who carried it from the noble Companions and those who followed them in goodness. Rather, it takes them to the level of cursing some of the Prophets.” And then he concluded, “And in conclusion, it is befitting that we describe these people as the extremist Murji‘ah of the era before we describe them as the<br />Khawaarij of the era.”[13]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[5]:</span></strong> Indeed, the Khawaarij fell into irjaa‘. So they performed takfeer upon the one who committed a major sin, or they held the view of revolting against the oppressive rulers and they believed that actions are outside the appellation of eemaan. So Sayyid Qutb was a Takfeeree, yet along with that he defined eemaan with the definition of the Murji‘ah.<br /><br />It is due to this that the Scholars of the Salaf – rahimahumullaah – made the following statements:<br /><br />Stated Aboo Qilaabah (d.104H) – rahimahullaah, “No man innovates an innovation, except that he makes the sword lawful.[14]”<br /><br />And Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) used to call all of the people of innovation: Khawaarij. And he used to say, “The Khawaarij differed in name, but they were united upon the sword.”[15]<br /><br />And ’Abdullaah Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) – rahimahullaah – said, “How can I be a Murji‘ when I do not hold the view of the sword?!”[16]<br /><br />So in that which has proceeded is a clarification that the Khawaarij are to be described with al-Irjaa‘. Likewise, the Murji‘ah are described as Khawaarij, because they were united in testifying for themselves that they had complete and perfect eemaan. And they believed that eemaan was a single entity, which could not be divided into parts, nor could one possess some of it and not the rest of it. They also held the view of rebellion with the sword against the oppressive rulers. And Allaah knows best and may the greetings and salutations of Allaah be upon our Prophet, Muhammad.<br /><br /><em>Written by: Aboo ’Umar Usaamah al-’Utaybee</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes: </span></strong><br /><br />[1] The following is a translation of the essay entitled, al-Khawaarij Humul-Murji‘ah by Aboo ’Umar Usaamah al-’Utaybee, who is a student of knowledge originally from Jordan. He has graduated from the Islaamic University of al-Madeenah, from the Faculty of Hadeeth. He has studied, amongst others, with Imaam Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-’Uthaymeen and al-’Allaamah Rabee’ Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee. Amongst his other accomplishments is participating in the Jihaad in Afghanistan. However, he left dismayed after the assassination of Shaykh Jameelur-Rahmaan at the hands of one of Hikmatyar’s henchmen.<br /><br />[2] Refer to the Risaalah of al-Istakhree, as is found in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/36). Note: There is some speculation concerning the narration of al-Istakhree. However, this particular statement was followed up by al-Istakhree, as shall follow.<br /><br />[3] Refer to as-Sunnah (p. 74) of Aboo Bakr al-Khallaal.<br /><br />[4] Refer to al-Kitaabul-Lateef (p. 17) of Ibn Shaaheen.<br /><br />[5] Refer to ash-Sharee’ah (no. 2057) of al-Aajurree.<br /><br />[6] Refer to Maqaalaatul-Islaamiyyeen (1/202) of Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree.<br /><br />[7] Refer to al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/148) of ash-Shahrastaanee.<br /><br />[8] Refer to al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/162).<br /><br />[9] Refer to at-Tabseer fid-Deen (p. 24) of Aboo Haamid al-Isfaraayeenee.<br /><br />[10] Refer to the Risaalah of al-Istakhree, as occurs in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/36).<br /><br />[11] Refer to Majmoo’ul-Fataawaa (7/375) of Ibn Taymiyyah.<br /><br />[12] Sayyid Qutb: He was mentioned by Shaykh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in Jamaa’ah Waahidah (p. 76, 129, 131, 138, 152, 154, 165-167). And Shaykh Rabee’ commented (p. 159) about Qutb’s books: Fee Dhilaalil-Qur‘aan, al-’Adaalatul-Ijtimaa’iyyah and Ma’aalim fit-Tareeq, “They are filled with takfeer.” And he said (p. 160), “They – the people of innovations and misguidance – have endeavoured to make lawful the manhaj of Sayyid Qutb, the ignorant takfeeree, under the titles: the new manhaj of as-Salafiyyah, confrontational Salafiyyah, the Salafiyyah of belief and modern confrontation in place of this magnificent Salafee manhaj.” And he said about his manhaj (p. 171), “He has gathered together great misguidance and innovations.” And he said (p. 173), “The books of Sayyid Qutb are takfeeriyyah.” And Shaykh Rabee’ also mentioned him (p.170, 173, 187). And Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee mentioned him in the introduction to an-Nasrul-’Azeez ’alar-Raddil-Wajeez (p. 21, 24), and Shaykh Rabee’ mentioned him in the same book in a number of places, (p. 83, 88-89, 102, 104, 120, 122, 166-167, 190, 193, 198). And him and his followers were mentioned by Shaykh Rabee’ in Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah fin-Naqd (p. 63). And Shaykh Rabee’ said about him in al-Haddul-Faasil (p. 5), “A great misguided individual.” And Shaykh Mqubil stated in Fadaa‘ih wa Nasaa‘ih (p. 64), “He was considered a writer and not a mufassir.” And he said (p. 65), “And I ask Allaah the Magnificent to to preserve our brother Rabee’ Ibn Haadee since he has clarified the beliefs of Sayyid Qutb and whatever he has of deviation.” And he said (p. 66), “So the one who inclines towards adh-Dhilaal, then it is feared that he will fall into ad-dalaal (misguidance). So if you absolutely must read adh-Dhilaal, then I advise you to read that which was written by the brother ’Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad ad-Duwaysh and that which was written by Shaykh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee – hafidhahullaah.” And Shaykh Muqbil said about him (p. 161), “The themes within the books of Sayyid Qutb are the wheels for the rest of the books of misguidance.” Refer also to Fadaa‘ih wa Nasaa‘ih (p. 147, 152). And Shaykh Muqbil stated in Fadaa‘ih wa Nasaa‘ih (p. 148), “I read what the brother Rabee’ Ibn Haadee – hafidhahullaah - wrote about the affair of Sayyid Qutb, his belief of Hulooliyyah (oneness of Allaah with His creation), such that he is Huloolee, his curses upon ’Uthmaan and I read about the Takfeeree tendencies in the books of Sayyid Qutb. Indeed, many from amongst Jamaa’atut-Takfeer use the statements of Sayyid Qutb as evidence.” And Shaykh Muqbil said (p. 151), “He is from the imaams of the people of innovation.” And he said (p. 152), “And he is an imaam from amongst the imaams of the people of innovation.” Shaykh ’Ubayd al-Jaabiree stated in the audiotape, ad-Dawaabit (side 1), “It is not Fee Dhilaalil-Qur‘aan (In the Shade of the Qur‘aan), rather it is Fee Dhilaalish-Shaytaan (In the Shade of the Shaytaan).” He was mentioned by Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee in al-Mawridul-’Adhabiz-Zilaal (p. 189, 248). For further elaboration upon the affair of Sayyid Qutb, refer to the following books by Shaykh Rabee’: al-’Awaasim mimmaa fee Kutub Sayyid Qutb minal-Qawaasim, Nadharaat fil-Kitaab at-Tasweerul-Fannee fil-Qur‘aan, Adwaa‘ ’alaa ’Aqeedah Sayyid Qutb and Mataa’in Sayyid Qutb fis-Sahaabah.<br /><br />[13] Refer to the al-Asaalah magazine (issue 24/p. 88-89).<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sunnahpublishing.net/">http://sunnahpublishing.net/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Jan 28, 2017 11:19 pm</p><hr />
