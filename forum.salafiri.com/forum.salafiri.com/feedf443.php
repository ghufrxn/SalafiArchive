<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Issues of Takfeer</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Question: Is it upon everyone to unrestrictedly apply these rulings (i.e. regarding the issue of Ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed) or should this affair be referred back to its people (i.e. the scholars)?</em><br /><br />ash-Shaikh ‘Abdul Aziz Rajihee حفظه الله:»<br /><br />These matters should be returned back to the scholars for they are ones who will study them and reflect on them. The common folk and the students should refer to the scholars in this regard and it is not for them to issue rulings in these matters because they have not completed the time span of their studies. As for the common folk, then they are not qualified for this. And as for the students (of knowledge), then they too must reference the scholars and not issue rulings, making takfeer based on vain desires. Perhaps a person may get little knowledge, memorizing the Qur’aan and such, then he starts to issue rulings making takfeer of people. This is not for him – he must return it back to the scholars. This is because he may think something to be disbelief when in fact it is not and this is due to his minimal knowledge, little insight and hastiness in issuing rulings. <br /><br />[An Explanation of The Nullifiers of Islam by Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab explained by ash-Shaikh al-‘Allammah ‘Abdul Aziz Rajihee حفظه الله]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 1:32 am</p><hr />
