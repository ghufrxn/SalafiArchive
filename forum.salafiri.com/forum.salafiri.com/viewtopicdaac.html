He did not urinate except sitting.’ (At-Tirmithi no.12 and an-Nisaa’i no. 29) at-Tirmithi said: ‘This is the best and most correct saying in this matter – also because it is better to guard and protect him from being splashed with his own urine.’<br /><br />Permanent Committee for Research and Verdicts<br /><br /><em>Fatawa Islamiyah, Vol. 2, p36-37, DARUSSALAM.</em></div>
