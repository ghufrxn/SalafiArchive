				<h3>Judging by Other than what Allaah has Revealed</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Are the rulers; who rule by other than what Allaah has revealed considered to be disbelievers, and what if we were to say that they are Muslims. Then what would we say regarding Allaah’s saying:<br /><br /><em>{And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the disbelievers}</em> [1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> The rulers who rule by other than what Allaah has revealed are of many different ranks. To pass a verdict regarding them differs according to their beliefs and actions.<br /><br />1) Hence he who rules by other than what Allaah has revealed and believes it to be better then the revealed law of Allaah, then that person is considered a disbeliever according to all the Muslims.<br /><br />2) Also, the one who rules by man-made laws instead of the law of Allaah, and considers it to be permissible, even if he were to say:<br /><br /><em>‘‘without doubt to rule by the revealed law of Allaah is far more better,’’</em><br /><br />…then even in this case he is still considered a disbeliever because of him trying to be the one to legitimatize that which Allaah has ordained as unlawful.<br /><br />3) As for the one who rules by other than what Allaah has revealed because of following his whims, or corruption, or having enmity between himself and the one being judged upon, or for any other numerous reasons, and he knows that undoubtedly he is being disobedient to Allaah by ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed and what is incumbent upon him is to rule by the revealed law of Allaah, then he will be regarded as being from amongst the disobedient people and those who commit major sins.<br /><br />Furthermore, he will also be regarded as having committed minor disbelief [2] , minor oppression, and minor transgression. For this is the meaning that has been reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas [3] , [and his student] Tawoos [4] , and a group amongst the pious predecessors [5] [with regards to his condition] and this type of verdict [regarding him] is something which is well known by the people of knowledge. And Allaah is the possessor of all prosperity &amp; success.<br /><br /><em>Reference: Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz: 3/990-991</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Surah Alma’idaah Ayah no.44.<br /><br />[2] In explanation of what is minor disbelief. It has been narrated on the authority of Sufyaan bin Uyainaah who narrated from Hisham bin Hujair from Ta’woos from Ibn ‘Abbbas who said regarding the disbelief of the aforestated Ayah: It is not like the disbelief which expels you from the fold of Islaam. Reported by Imam Albayhaqee 20/8, Ibn Abee Haatim in his Tafseer 4/1143/6424 printed by Albaaz, Alhakim 2/312 and he graded it Saheeh and Addahabi agreed with him. Al ‘Allaamah Albani in Silsilaah-Assaheehah 113/6 who graded it Saheeh and added that it is Saheeh according to the conditions of Imam Bukhari &amp; and his student Imam Muslim. [TN]<br /><br />[3] He is Abdullah bin ‘Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib bin Hishaam bin Abde-Mannaf Alqurshi Alhashimi. Born three years before Hijrah whilst the Prophet and his family were residing at a valley between two mountains of Makkah. He died in the year 68 A.H at Taif at the age of 70 years old. Refer to Taqreebut-Atahdheeb: 3431, page 518 checking of Abu Ashbaal. [TN]<br /><br />[4] He is Tawoos bin Kaisaan Alyamaani. One of the famous students of Abdullah Ibn ‘Abbas. It has been said that his name was Dhakwaan and Ta’woos was his nickname. Died in the year 106 A.H. or it has been said after that. Refer to Taqreebut-Atahdheeb: 3026, page 462, checking of Abu Ashbaal. [TN]<br /><br />[5] The following are some references as indicated by Allamah bin Baaz. Reported by Imam Attabari in his tafseer 6/166-167. Imam Abu Muzzafar Assam’aani (426-489 A.H.) in his tafseer volume 2/42. Imam Bhagawi in Ma’aalimut-Attanzeel volume 3/61. AlHakim in Mustadrak 2/393 and Addahabi agreed with him. Ibn Kathir in Tafseerul-Qur’aanil-Azeem 2/64. Ibn Abdil-Bur in Attamheed 4/237. AlQurtubi in Aljaami-lil-Ahkaamil-Qur’aan 6/190, Abu Bakr Ibnil-AlArabi in Ahkaamul-Qur’aan 2/624-625. Abu Abdillah bin Battah in AlIbaanah 2/723.
