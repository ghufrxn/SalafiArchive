And certainly, Allâh is never unjust to (His) slaves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Anfal (8):51</span></strong><br />&quot;This is because of that which your hands had forwarded. And verily, Allâh is not unjust to His slaves.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Hajj (22):10</span></strong><br />That is because of what your hands have sent forth, and verily, Allâh is not unjust to (His) slaves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fussilat (41):46</span></strong><br />Whosoever does righteous good deed it is for (the benefit of) his ownself, and whosoever does evil, it is against his ownself, and your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Qaf (50):29</span></strong><br />The Sentence that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust (to the least) to the slaves.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Yunus (10):44</span></strong><br />Truly! Allâh wrongs not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">An-Nahl (16):33</span></strong><br />Do they (the disbelievers and polytheists) await but that the angels should come to them [to take away their souls (at death)], or there should come the command (i.e. the torment or the Day of Resurrection) of your Lord? Thus did those before them. And Allâh wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">An-Nahl (16):118</span></strong><br />And unto those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you (O Muhammad SAW) before [in Sûrat-Al-An'am, (The Cattle), see Verse 6:146]. And We wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ar-Rum (30):9</span></strong><br />Do they not travel in the land, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength, and they tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these (pagans) have done, and there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs. Surely, Allâh wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Hud (11):101</span></strong><br />We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. So their âliha (gods), other than Allâh, whom they invoked, profited them naught when there came the Command of your Lord, nor did they add aught (to their lot) but destruction.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thenoblequran.com/">http://www.thenoblequran.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
