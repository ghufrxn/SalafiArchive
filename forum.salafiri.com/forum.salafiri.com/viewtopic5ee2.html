				<h3>{1} The importance and benefit in refuting not only the innovation but also the innovator.</h3>

				<div class="content">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah commented:<br /><br />“Some of the people said to Imaam Ahmad that ‘I find it difficult to critisize (narrators in the chain of narrations) that they have some problems and are like so and so? Imaam Ahmad replied, ‘if you and I remain silent, then how will the ignorant one know the authentic from the unauthentic narration?” (Majmoo al-Fataawa 28/231)<br /><br />All praise is to Allah! Pay attention to how these few words of the salaf sum up the necessity to clarify the aqeedah and manhaj of those that have erred concerning it. For the one who ponders upon the words of Imam Ibn Tyamiyyah carefully will come to realise that this was said concerning a narrator who may have a weak memory or some other minor defect in narrating hadeeth, then what about the one who openly corrupts the Aqeedah and Manhaj, lying on Allaah (like the various callers to shirk and bidah from the various sects today) and our noble prophet? The one whom Allah has blessed will see that it is far more urgent and necessary to clarify the condition of this one!<br /><br />Further, the intellectual one is required to take one step further and he will realise that Imaam Ibn Tyamiyyah through the words of Imam Ahmad “how will the ignorant one know” is informing us that the basis of having the correct deen is to take it from those who are ahl us sunnah {the trustworthy ones} and not Ahlul Bidah {those that have sold their deen being the disparaged ones} for they will only spread knowledge which is corrupt and vain, thus leaving the ignorant as an ignorant one.<br /><br />So noble reader know that it was due to the foresight bestowed upon Ibn Taymiyyah by Allah that he concluded this discussion by saying:<br /><br />“Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted and this corruption is far greater than that being caused when during war the people are conquered. Verily, when they take over a country they do not corrupt and take over the heart and that which is in it related to the deen, but they do it over a long period. On the other hand, the people of Bidah they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmoo al Fataawa 28/232)<br /><br />So it is clear to see that the Ahlul Bidah are like the serpent whose venom is deadly and at the same time instant in that they will affect and perverse the heart of the salafee. How much of a calamity is it that the person of innovation be allowed to take a place in our hearts and masaajid yet we know full well the venom of him and his innovation! Allah is the protector and his aid is sought!<br /><br />Furthermore, it is not difficult to deduce from the words of Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah that “Had Allah not made the upright repel the evil ones {Ahlul Bidah} harm, the religion would be corrupted” that this no doubt shows the superiority and status of the scholar, but most particularly the one who clarifies the affairs of the aqeedah and manhaj .<br /><br />It is from the great blessing of Allah that in every time he sends scholars who ‘remove the hair from the flour’ and clarify the affairs. In current times where would we be had we not had the likes of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, Shaikh Albaanee, Shaikh Uthaymeen and currently Shaykh Rabee May Allah bless them all and have mercy on them. Ameen.<br /><br />Yet the calamity has struck those who belittle the dawah of these scholars past and present being affected and infected by the false principles around them and Ahlul Ahwaa. The irony of it, they “refute” those from amongst these scholars who they say they do nothing but to “refute”! May allah guide us all!<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not-drink-o-salafi-from-the-well-in-which-their-is-impurity/">http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not ... -impurity/</a><!-- m --></div>
