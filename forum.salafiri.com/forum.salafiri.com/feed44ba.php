<em><strong>Beware of Riyaa, which is doing a deed for the sake of being seen or heard.</strong></em><br /><br />An example of this when someone goes to Hajj so that it can be said of him “Hajji so and so.” The title Hajji (or Al-Hajj in Arabic) was not a term that was known to the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), so we cannot hear from any of them that he said about his brother “Hajji so and so.” Rather, this is from the innovations of those in recent times. So have sincerity in your Hajj and say as Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“O Allaah, (this is) a Hajj with no riyaa or sam’ah in it.” [2]<br /><br />[2] Translator’s Note: Riyaa means doing deeds to be seen and Sam’ah means doing deeds to be heard.<br /><br /><strong>Source: Advice and Guidelines for those Performing Hajj – Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo, Translator: isma’eel alarcon</strong><br /><br />Taken from: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/07/27/adding-the-title-hajji-to-the-name-after-completing-the-hajj/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2015/07/27/adding-the-title-hajji-to-the-name-after-completing-the-hajj/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 10:13 pm</p><hr />
