				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Adhaan for Rain And Cold Weather</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Prepared by the Sunnah Publishing Editorial Staff</em><br /><br />Ibn ’Abbaas (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said to the mu‘adhdhin on a rainy day, “When you say, ‘Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullaah,’ do not say, ‘Hayya ’alas-salaah,’ but say, ‘Salloo fee buyootikum (Pray in your houses).’ Then people objected to this, so he said, “One who is better than me did this. Friday is a day of honour, and I hated for you to go through the hardship of walking through the mud and grime.”[1]<br /><br />Naafi’ said, ‘Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhumaa) called the adhaan on a night at Dhajnaan (a mountain near Makkah), then he said, “Salloo fir-rihaal (Pray at the riding animals).” He told us that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) would command the mu‘adhdhin to call the adhaan, then to say at the end of it, “Pray at your rihaal,” during the<br />cold nights or rain whilst travelling.’[2]<br /><br />Usaamah Ibn ’Umayr (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said: We were with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) at al-Hudaybiyyah and a rain that did not even wet the bottoms of our shoes fell upon us, so the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) called out, “Pray at your rihaal.”[3]<br /><br />One severely cold night, Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhumaa) called to those who were with him, “Pray at your rihaal.” And he said: When it was like this, I saw the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) command the people, “Pray at your rihaal.”[4]<br /><br />Jaabir Ibn ’Abdullaah (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said: We were travelling with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). It rained, so he said, “Whosoever amongst you wishes, he may pray in his rihaal.”[5]<br /><br />After mentioning some of the preceding ahaadeeth, Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.671H) said, “It shows the permission to refrain from the congregation due to the hardship that results rain, wind and cold. Included in that meaning are the hardships that effect one whilst he is a resident or upon a journey.”[6]<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes: </strong><br /><br />[1] Related by al-Bukhaaree (no. 850) and Muslim (no. 1128).<br /><br />[2] Related by al-Bukhaaree (no. 596) and Muslim (no. 1126).<br /><br />[3] Related by Ahmad (5/74-75), Aboo Daawood (no. 1057), Ibn Khuzaymah (no. 1758) and Ibn Hibbaan (no. 2083).<br /><br />[4] Related by Ibn Hibaan in his Saheeh (no. 2076).<br /><br />[5] Related by Muslim (no. 1127).<br /><br />[6] Refer to Tarhut-Tathreeb (2/318) of al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sunnahpublishing.net/">http://sunnahpublishing.net/</a><!-- m --></div>
