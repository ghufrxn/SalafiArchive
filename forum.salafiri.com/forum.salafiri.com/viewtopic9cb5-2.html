				<div class="content">The second question of Fatwa no. 16502<br />Q 2: What is the ruling on anyone who ridicules the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) with the intention of only annoying another person? Is this Haram (prohibited)?<br />A: Ridiculing the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is an act of Kufr (disbelief) and apostasy from Islam, even if the person is joking or intending to annoy someone else. Allah (Exalted be He) says, If you ask them (about this), they declare: &quot;We were only talking idly and joking.&quot; Say: &quot;Was it at Allâh (عز وجل), and His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?&quot; Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.<br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta'<br /><br />Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd <br />Shaykh Abdul-`Aziz Al Al-Shaykh <br />Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan 	<br />Shaykh Abdullah ibn Ghudayyan 	<br />Shaykh Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</div>
