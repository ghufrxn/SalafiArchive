(3) False Interpretations<br /><br />Ibn ul-Qayyim (rahimahullāh) states:<br />“To sum up: The splitting of the People of the Book and of this Ummah into 73 sects is only understood via their interpretations.” (Ilaamul Muwaqi’een 4/317)<br /><br />Ibn Abi’l-’Izz al-Hanafī (rahimahullāh) states:<br />“Did the Khawārij revolt, or the Mu’tazilah depart or the Rawāfid reject and the Ummah split into 73 sects due to anything except corrupt and false interpretations? (Sharh Aqeedah Tahawiyyah pg. 89)<br /><br />Once the dawah has been clouded and clarity diminishes then the floodgates open for all the watering down, false interpretations, accommodations of all the opinions ever held by the people. It is at this time that the dawah becomes something which is strange only adhered to by those who seen as strangers! So one of the most important ways to remove such blemishes and confusions concerning the dawah is to be clear upon the prophetic Aqeedah, Manhaj and stopping where the salaf stopped. This one is the true salafee and sunni.<br /><br />Pay heed, as salafees we must not allow any false interpretations of anyone, no matter how many degrees they may have, how brilliant their courses are, how filled their seminar rooms become and so on to alter the dawah ‘through the back door’, the saying of the arabs is to be noted “the shade of the stick will never straighten up until the stick itself is crooked”.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 12:07 am</p><hr />
