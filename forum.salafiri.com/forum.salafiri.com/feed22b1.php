<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Big Bang Theory Repudiated!</span></span></strong><br /><br />The second theory; is the big bang theory. In summary –and I will try to clearly explain it—this theory states: The origin of creation was a simple ball comprised of a single cell. And it was tiny like the head of a pin. It was floating in time and space then it exploded fifteen billion years ago. Thus the result of this explosion was the gradual evolution of the universe. Thus the origin of this entire universe was a pinhead!<br /><br />So the question which remains as a whip to lash the backs of these atheists is:<br /><br />Where did this pinhead come from?! They have no answer for this.<br /><br />And then; why was this ball stagnant and then suddenly it decided to explode?! And what was special about this exact moment that it exploded that separate it from other moments?! How did this explosion result in astonishing order? Do explosions equate with order? How did a speck of lifelessness produce living organisms with intellects and sensibility?  The atheist will respond that reactions occurred which produced cells which formed after the explosion giving magnificent order to everything.<br /><br />If the atheist is asked: How did this forming of cells occur? And how did life appear from inanimate objects? The atheist will respond: This happens automatically, by coincidence!<br /><br />Coincidence according to the atheist in reality is the Lord of all that exist, the fashioner of the creation! This is because according to them every phenomenon is connected to it. So coincidence brought the heavens into existence and it causes the atmosphere, and the atmospheric pressure, and the gases, it causes the clouds and the land suitable for life, it causes the rivers, the oceans and the fish; it brought about mankind with bones suitable for his needs, it caused hearing and sight, it caused a heart that beats, it caused red blood cells and white blood cells with the appropriate blood cell count and above all this it caused intellect and perception. All of this according to the atheist happened by coincidence!<br /><br />Allow us to place letters in a box. Then we will shake the box with a forceful shaking, and then open it. Would anyone believe that when we opened it we will find a great passionate speech?!<br /><br />Or allow us to throw bricks behind our backs, one by one, and then when we look, we will be shocked by a beautiful home?!<br /><br />All of this happens by coincidence?! Is this sensible?!<br /><br />Reflect with me over the previous example of throwing the bricks: If we change from bricks and threw eggs—for example—would our throwing result in a house? The answer is a resounding: No.<br /><br />Thus it is a must that there is design and wisdom. Like this was the atoms of the universe; they were only joined together with wisdom. So if the atoms joined in this manner they became gold, and if the joined together in a certain manner they became water, and so on. Therefore ‘chance’ or ‘coincidence’ is not sufficient to accept what they say, rather there must be wisdom, and desire, and design.<br /><br />In contrast to this philosophy we find the Quran explains this reality is a few words.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><strong>أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بَل لَا يُوقِنُونَ</strong></span><br /><br />Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. (Soorah At Tur 52: 35-36)<br /><br />This was understood by a Bedouin Arab, and he did not hold a degree in mathematics nor did he study the theories of Nietzsche, or Lavoisier, or Darwin or other than them. Rather it was only his upright natural disposition when he said: Dung is evidence of a camel, and footsteps are evidence of a passerby, thus the heavens with its great stars, and the oceans with its waves, are they not proof of the All-Knowing the All-Powerful (Creator)?!<br /><br />But Atheism makes people from the most foolish of the creation, without exception.<br /><br />From the Upcoming Publication: Atheism: Its Causes, Dangers and ways to Confront it<br /><br /><em>By Doctor Saalih ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Uthman Sindee</em><br /><em>Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-big-bang-theory-repudiated-by-dr-shaykh-salih-sindee">http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-big-bang- ... lih-sindee</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2016 11:25 pm</p><hr />
