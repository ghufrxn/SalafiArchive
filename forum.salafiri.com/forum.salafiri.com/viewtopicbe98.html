				<div class="content">We read and hear about the Fuqahaa Murji’ah, I request clarity (about them)? Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000BF">Q: May Allah be kind to you Noble Shaykh, this questioner says: We read and hear about the Fuqahaa Murji’ah, I request clarity (about them)?</span></strong><br /><br />A: The Fuqahaa Murji’ah or the Ahlus Sunnah Murji’ah, they are the Hanifiyyah, because with them Faith is a statement by the tongue and belief in the heart, as for actions they say it does not enter into the essence of Eeman (faith). So due to this they were named Murji’ah, because they remove actions from being called Eemaan, and they have been called the Fuqahaa Murji’ah or the Ahlis Sunnah Murji’ah. And theres no doubt that this is incorrect, whats important is that their type of Irjaa is of a lesser degree. As for the Murji’ah then they are of four types:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">First category:</span> The worst type and the most wicked are the Jahmiyyah who say that Faith is just by knowing (something) in the heart even if one doesn’t believe in it. This is the worst type of Irjaa.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Second category:</span> They are those who say faith is only a belief in the heart without expressing it on the tongue, and this is the statement of the Ashaairah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Third category:</span> They are the individuals who say faith is a statement on the tongue even if one doesn’t believe it in the heart, and this is the statement of the Karaamiyah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The fourth category:</span> They say faith is a belief in the heart and a statement on the tongue and they are the Hanifiyyah.<br /><br /><em>Source: Sharh Rasaail Al-Imaam Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhab Explained by Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzaan, Q&amp;A pg.116</em><br /><br />Translator: Muhammad Ibn Adnaan Abouharb<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://albinaapublishing.com/we-read-and-hear-about-the-fuqahaa-murjiah-i-request-clarity-about-them-shaykh-saalih-al-fawzan/">http://albinaapublishing.com/we-read-an ... al-fawzan/</a><!-- m --></div>
