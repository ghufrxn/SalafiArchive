<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Imam Abdur-Rahman As-Sa’di attends the tea party</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>Narrated by Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al Badr</em><br /><br />The following is a summary translation<br /><br />Shaykh Abdur Razzaq Al Badr: If the person sees his daughters or his little ones playing with toys, he should sit with them sometimes.<br /><br />Shaykh Abdur Rahman As Sa’di—may Allah have mercy upon him; once his young daughter—young at that time—and her friend who was her age, were in the courtyard of the home. And he was a major scholar, and judge, and Imam and lecturer. He was going to leave from the home and there was his daughter and a young girl her age playing with these toys. And they had made up a skit as though they were in a room, pretending that some things were tea and coffee and they sat playing as girls play. When he wanted to leave the other young girl—not the daughter of the Shaykh—said to him: ‘Why don’t you visit us?’ He replied: ‘Tomorrow inshaAllah I will visit you.’<br /><br />So when he wanted to exit he came to the house and stood at the door and knocked on the door and he called his daughter’s friend by her name. She opened the door and said: ‘Please enter.’ So he came and sat with them in their spot. They sat and pretended to give him coffee and they spoke with him and told him about their toys, and then he stood.<br /><br />When he wanted to stand his daughter said to him: ‘You have not been my guest.’ He replied: ‘Tomorrow I will be your guest.’ The next day he came and knocked on the door and he called his daughter by her name and she opened the door and said: ‘Please enter.’ He entered this room and sat with them and he humored them and he conversed with them.<br /><br />This doesn’t take more than three or four minutes from a person. And his daughter cheerfully narrates this now in one of the books, and she is an adult now. <em>This occurred once in her youth but it brought about tremendous happiness for her</em>.<br /><br />Thus a person should not be neglectful of these affairs. When he sees his daughters he gives them some of his time; four minutes, five minutes, at most ten minutes; but it will do a lot in the heart of the young one.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source (please view to listen to the audio)</span></strong>: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/imam-abdur-rahman-as-sadi-attends-the-tea-party">http://mtws.posthaven.com/imam-abdur-ra ... -tea-party</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2016 11:13 pm</p><hr />
