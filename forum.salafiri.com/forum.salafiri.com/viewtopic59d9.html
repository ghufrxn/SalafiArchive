				<h3>Ruling On A Man Delivering A Child For A Woman- Shaykh Al-Albani [1420H]</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> What is the ruling on a man delivering a child for a woman?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> The aspect of bringing a woman into a hospital in order for her to deliver her child should not bring about an opinion for its absolute allowance. Rather there must be some limitations and restrictions set to it.<br /><br />So if a female doctor sees, with her knowledge and experience, that this pregnant woman will not be able to undergo a natural birth, and that she will require an operation or surgery. Then in this situation, she should be transported to the hospital. But in the case where the birth is natural, it is not permissible for her to leave her house to be admitted into a hospital just to deliver a baby that can be delivered naturally. But if this woman is forced to enter the hospital, a male doctor must not be put in the supervision of delivering her baby. But in the case that a female doctor is not found, there is no harm in a male doctor (seeing her), for that is from the aspects of extreme necessity. Rather, if a female doctor is not present, it is obligatory for a male doctor to deliver her child, if the pregnant woman is in a situation in which there is danger.<br /><br />This answer is derived from two principles from the principles of Usool-ul-Fiqh, which are:<br /><br /><ul>1. Cases of necessity make the forbidden allowable, and<br />2. A necessity is determined according to its extent</ul><br />So the general rule is that a woman is not permitted to leave her home except in the case of a necessity. This is stated in <em>Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</em>. When Allaahâ€™s saying was revealed:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And remain in your homes and do not display yourselves like the evil displaying of the first Days of Ignorance&quot;</span></strong>, the Prophet, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Allaah has permitted you (women) to go out (from your homes) for your necessities.&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />[<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Asaalah</span></strong>, Issue #3]</div>
