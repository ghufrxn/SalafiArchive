And it is [also] not permissible for him to narrate a hadeeth whilst he knows it to be weak. However, if he narrates a weak hadeeth to reveal it’s weakness and warn the people from it, then that is obligatory.<br /><br />Likewise, he should not narrate stories which he assumes are worthy [of being narrated] without checking [their authenticity], and he should not narrate stories which he knows are fabricated, because that is being dishonest and deceiving the people.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwa-online.com/narrating-unverified-stories-in-the-path-of-dawah/">http://www.fatwa-online.com/narrating-u ... -of-dawah/</a><!-- m --></div>
