<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Correct Creed is the Basis of the Religion Islam</span></span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allah, and may exaltation and safety be granted to Muhammad, his family, his companions, and those who aid them.<br /><br />To proceed:<br /><br />Imaam ‘Abdul-’Azeez Ibn Baaz [d. 1420 A.H.], may Allah have mercy on him, said:<br /><br />Since the correct creed is the foundation and basis of the religion of Islam, I thought that this should be the topic of the lesson. It is well-known by way of legislative proofs from the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that actions and statements are only accepted if they are performed by a person with sound creed. If a person’s creed is not sound, that which emanates from him from statements and actions will be rendered vein.<br /><br />Allah, The Most High, says: “And whoever denies the faith – his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.”  [Soorah al-Maa’idah (5): 5]<br /><br />And He, The Most High, says: “And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” [Soorah az-Zumar (39): 65] – And there are many ayaat that carry this meaning.
