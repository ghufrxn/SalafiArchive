The four things are: الشكر (Shukr - thankfulness), الإيمان (Imaan - Faith), الدعاء (al-Du`aa’ - supplication) and الاستغفار (al-Istighfaar - seeking forgiveness). Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{ما يفعل الله بعذابكم إن شكرتم وآمنتم}<br /><br />{Why should Allaah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him?} <br /></span>[Surah al-Nisaa' (4): 147]<br /><br />And Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{وما كان الله ليعذبهم وأنت فيهم وما كان الله معذبهم وهم يستغفرون}<br /><br />{And Allaah would not punish them while you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are amongst them, nor will He punish them while they seek (Allaah's) forgiveness.} <br /></span>[Surah al-Anfaal (8): 33]<br /><br />And Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{قل ما يعبأ بكم ربي لولا دعاؤكم} <br /><br />{Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to the disbelievers): “My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him.

So the torment will be yours forever (inseparable, permanent punishment).”}</span> <br />[Surah al-Furqaan (25): 77]<br /><br />As for the three, then they are the following: المكر (al-Makar – slyness/evil plotting), البغي (al-Baghi - transgression), النكث (al-Nakath – breaking the commitments). Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{فمن نكث فإنما ينكث على نفسه} <br /><br />{Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm}</span> <br />[Surah al-Fath (48): 10]<br /><br />And Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{ولا يحيق المكر السيئ إلا بأهله} <br /><br />{But the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it.} </span><br />[Surah al-Faatir (35): 43]<br /><br />And Allaah تعالى says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">{إنما بغيكم على أنفسكم} <br /><br />{O mankind!

Verily, Satan does not enter a house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited. Does this refer to reciting Surah Al-Baqarah only once when a person buys a new house, or each year, or each night?

It also indicates that Satan does not approach the houses in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited. Furthermore, not fixing a certain number of times for reciting this Surah signifies the desirability of reciting it frequently so as to ward off Satan and seek the great reward associated with that, as you will earn a good deed for every letter you recite, and a good deed gets a tenfold reward, as mentioned in another Hadith.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Qur’aan on Following the Sunnah</span></strong><br /><em>Prepared by Aboo Shaybah</em><br /><br />A collection of aayaat from the Qur’aan which command obeying the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) and outline the rewards entailed from doing so, as well as aayaat which warn against following a course other than that of the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) and outline the adverse outcome of doing so. Some aayaat also explain that the Messenger’s (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) teachings are revelation from Allaah, and that following him amounts to obeying Allaah.<br /><br />The interested reader is advised to refer to the Tafseer of these aayaat for further edification.<br /><br />“Say: If you love Allaah, then follow me. If you do so, Allaah will love you and forgive your sins for you. And Allaah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):31]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: Obey Allaah and the Messenger. But if they turn away, then Allaah does not love the ungrateful disbelievers.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):32]</ul><br />“And obey Allaah and the Messenger so that you may be granted mercy.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):132]<br /><br /><ul>“Those are the bounds set by Allaah. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted to jannaat under which rivers flow to dwell there eternally, and that is the supreme success. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and transgresses His bounds shall be placed in the hellfire to dwell there eternally, and he shall have a humiliating punishment.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):13-14]</ul><br />“O you who have eemaan! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. If you differ over anything, refer it to Allaah and the Messenger if you truly have eemaan in Allaah and the Last Day. That is best and most suitable for settlement. Have you not seen those who claim to have eemaan in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They desire to refer judgement to false judges although they were ordered to reject them; and shaytaan wishes to lead them far astray.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):59-60]<br /><br /><ul>“Therefore, no! By your Lord, they cannot have eemaan until they appoint you as judge in all<br />which they dispute, then not find any objection within themselves to what you decide, and they accept it with full submission.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):65]</ul><br />“And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger, they shall be in the company of those upon whom Allaah has bestowed His favour – among the Prophets, the steadfast upon the truth, the martyrs, and the righteous – and what excellent company they are.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):69]<br /><br /><ul>“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the people of eemaan, We shall leave him on what he has chosen, and We will make him taste hell – an evil destination indeed.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):115]</ul><br />“Whatever good reaches you is from Allaah, and whatever evil afflicts you is from yourself. And We have sent you to mankind as a Messenger, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. And whoever obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed Allaah; but as for those who turn away, We have not sent you over them as a guardian.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):79-80]<br /><br /><ul>“And obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, but be warned. And if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to clearly convey the message.” [al-Maa’idah (5):92]</ul><br />“And this is My straight path, so follow it; and do not follow the other paths because they will separate you from His path. That is what He has ordained for you in order for you to attain taqwaa.” [al-An‘aam (6):153]<br /><br /><ul>“O you who have eemaan! Answer Allaah and His Messenger when he calls you to what gives you life. And know that Allaah intervenes between and man and his heart, and that to Him you shall be gathered.” [al-Anfaal (8):24]</ul><br />“And obey Allaah and His Messenger, and do not dispute with each other lest you meet failure and your strength depart. And patiently persevere; indeed, Allaah is with those who patiently persevere.” [al-Anfaal (8):46]<br /><br /><ul>“The people of eemaan – men and women alike – are allies to one another. They command the good, forbid the evil, establish the prayer, pay the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. It is they whom Allaah will grant His mercy. Indeed, Allaah is Almighty, All-Wise.” [at-Tawbah (9):71]</ul><br />“With clear signs and revealed books. And We revealed to you the thikr so that you clearly explain to people what has been sent down to them, and that they might contemplate.” [an-Nahl (16):44]<br /><br /><ul>“And they say, ‘We have eemaan in Allaah and the Messenger, and we obey,” but then a group of them turn away afterwards. Those are not people of eemaan.” [an-Noor (24):47]</ul><br />“The statement of the people of eemaan, when they are called to Allaah and His Messenger, is only that they say, ‘We hear and we obey.’ They are the successful ones. And anyone who obeys Allaah and His Messenger, fears Allaah, and observes taqwaa of Him – those are the victorious.” [an-Noor (24): 51-52]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: obey Allaah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for the duty given to him, and you are only responsible for the duty given to you. And if you obey him, you shall be guided. And the Messenger has no duty except to clearly convey the message.” [an-Noor (24):54]</ul><br />“Do not call out to the Messenger the way you call out each other. Allaah already knows which of you slips away concealed by others. Thus, let those who oppose his command beware lest strife befall them or they are afflicted by an excruciating punishment.” [an-Noor (24):63]<br /><br /><ul>“And the day when the oppressor shall bite at his hands he will say, ‘If I had only taken a path with the Messenger.’” [al-Furqaan (25):27]</ul><br />“It is not fit for someone of eemaan – man or woman – to exercise their own choice when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.” [al-Ahzaab (33):36]<br /><br /><ul>“Verily, those who abuse Allaah and His Messenger, Allaah has cursed them in this world and the hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating torment.” [al-Ahzaab (33):57]</ul><br />“On the day when their faces will be turned about in the hellfire they will say, ‘If we had only obeyed Allaah and obeyed the Messenger.’”[al-Ahzaab (33):66]<br /><br /><ul>“O you who have eemaan! Observe taqwaa of Allaah and speak what is correct. If you do so, He will rectify your deeds and forgive your sins for you. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has achieved a tremendous accomplishment.” [al-Ahzaab (33):70-71]</ul><br />“O you who have eemaan! Do not put anything before Allaah and His Messenger. And observe taqwaa of Allaah. Indeed, Allaah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.” [al-Hujuraat (49):1]<br /><br /><ul>“Your companion has neither strayed nor erred. And he does not speak of his own desire; it is nothing other than revelation revealed to him.” [an-Najm (53):2-4]</ul><br />“Whatever spoils taken from the inhabitants of the villages without combat that are granted by Allaah to His Messenger – they are for Allaah, His Messenger and relatives, the orphans, the needy, and the stranded wayfarer, so that it would not become wealth distributed between the rich among you. And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids you from, refrain. And Observe taqwaa of Allaah. Indeed, Allaah is severe in punishment.” [al-Hashr (59):7]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: none can ever protect me from Allaah, and I can never find refuge in other than Him; I merely notify on behalf of Allaah and convey His messages. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger shall surely have the fire of hell, dwelling there eternally.” [al-Jinn (72):22-24]</ul><br />Source &amp; Arabic: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 07, 2017 12:49 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Brief Explanation of Soorah al-Faatihah</span></strong><br /><em>by Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</em><br /><br /><ul>Translated by Aboo Shaybah<br />[Revised Sha‘baan 1435/June 2014]</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1- Importance and Significance</span></strong><br /><br />This soorah has tremendous importance, since it is the greatest soorah in the Qur’aan, just as Aayah al-Kursee is the greatest aayah in the Qur’aan. Due to its significance, it is written at the beginning of the mus-haf and this is why it is named Faatihah al-Kitaab (the Opening of the Book). All this goes to show its importance, and it was not placed as the first soorah in the mus-haf except due to its tremendous significance.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2- Ruling of Reciting it in Salaah</span></strong><br /><br />Another indication of its significance is that Allaah obligated its recitation in each rak‘ah during salaah.<br /><br />The majority of scholars hold that its recitation in salaah is obligatory. If someone is able to recite it but does not do so, his salaah is invalid. This is based on the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam), “There is no salaah for someone who did not recite Faatihah al-Kitaab.”[1] However, if someone is unable to recite it due to him being unable to memorize it, he recites whatever other aayaat of the Qur’aan he may know. If he does not know any portion of the Qur’aan at all, he says words of thikr, such as: subhaanallaah, al-hamdu lillaah, laa ilaaha illallaah, allaahu akbar, laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah. This is based on the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam), “When you stand to perform salaah, say allaahu akbar. If you know some amount of the Qur’aan, recite. Otherwise, say al-hamdu lillaah, allaahu akbar, and laa ilaaha illallaah, then move on to the rukoo‘ position…”[2]<br /><br />The majority of scholars hold that it is obligatory for the imaam (person leading others in salaah), as well as the munfarid (person performing salaah by himself), to recite Soorah al-Faatihah. However, they have differed concerning its obligation as it relates to the ma’moom (person being led in salaah by someone else). There are three views about this:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The first:</span></strong> it is obligatory for every person – whether imaam, ma’moom, or munfarid – to recite it. This is based on the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam), “There is no salaah for someone who did not recite Faatihah al-Kitaab.” This statement is general and applies to anyone who performs salaah. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam) also said to some of his Companions, “Perhaps you recite behind your Imaam?” They replied, “Yes, Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Do not do that except for Faatihah al-Kitaab, because there is no salaah for someone who did not recite it.”[3] This is the view held by ash-Shaafi‘ee and many of the scholars of hadeeth, including al-Bukhaaree and others. They hold that its recitation is obligatory for the imaam, ma’moom, and munfarid.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The second:</span></strong> it is not obligatory for the ma’moom because the recitation of the imaam is sufficient for those following him. This is based on the statement ascribed to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam), “If someone has an imaam, then the recitation of the imaam is sufficient for him.”[4] However, the chain of narration for this hadeeth is deficient and does not stand up to scrutiny. Those who hold this view also use the statement of Allaah,<br /><br />“And whenever the Qur’aan is recited, listen to it attentively and remain quiet in order for you to receive mercy” [al-A‘raaf:204]. They understand the aayah to mean that Allaah commands listening to recitation of the Qur’aan and remaining quiet, and the aayah is in reference to listening to the recitation in salaah. In other words, when the imaam recites, the ma’moom is to remain quiet and just listen. Thus, the aayah is understood to mean that the ma’moom does not recite anything, and the recitation of the imaam suffices for him as well as those following him. This view is held by Aboo Haneefah and Ahmad.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The third:</span></strong> the view held by Maalik, and also chosen by ibn Taymiyyah and a number of scholars, is that its recitation is obligatory for the ma’moom when recitation in salaah is done silently and the imaam does not recite aloud, such as Thuhr and ‘Asr. As for the salaah when recitation is aloud, the recitation of the imaam is sufficient for all, and the ma’moom remains quiet and listens attentively.<br /><br />Those who hold this view say that it simultaneously combines all of the evidences; the ones which obligate recitation of al-Faatihah are understood to apply to salaah in which recitation is done quietly, and the others as well as the aayah are understood to apply to salaah in which recitation is aloud. This view appears to be the most balanced, in shaa’ Allaah.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3- Its Names</span></strong><br /><br />Several names have been given to this soorah, each of which reflects a certain meaning. When something is given many names, this shows its excellence and virtue.<br /><br />It is called Faatihah al-Kitaab (the Opening of the Book) because it is written at the beginning of the mus-haf.<br /><br />It is called Umm al-Qur’aan (the Mother of the Qur’aan) because the entire Qur’aan revolves around the meanings contained in this soorah, and all the meanings detailed throughout the entire Qur’aan are summarized in it.<br /><br />It is called ar-Ruqyah (the Cure) because it is used to cure the ill. This is based on the saheeh narration where a group of the Companions requested that people in a certain village host them. However, those people refused. Then, the head of that village was bitten or stung – by a snake or scorpion – and his people requested the group of Companions to cure him. However, the Companions said that since the people in the village refused to host them, they would only treat him for a fee, and they agreed on a flock of sheep. One of the Companions then went to the head of the village, recited Soorah al-Faatihah upon him, and he was cured from his ailment as if he had previously been tied up and was now released.<br /><br />The Companions took the sheep, but did not make any further use of them until they asked permission from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam). When they returned to him and told him all that transpired he asked, “How did you know it was a ruqyah?” He then also said to them, “Divide the sheep among yourselves, and give me a share as well.”[5]<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam) also said, “The most deserving thing for which you could take a fee is the Book of Allaah.”[6]<br /><br />It is also called ash-Shaafiyah (the Remedy) because, by the permission of Allaah, it is a remedy for ailments affecting the heart – such as doubts, misconceptions, and whisperings from shaytaan – as well ailments and pains affecting the body, as in the aforementioned case with the head<br />of the village who was bitten.<br /><br />It is also called as-Sab‘ al-Mathaanee (the Seven Frequently Repeated). Allaah has stated,<br /><br />“And We have granted you seven which are frequently repeated, and the tremendous Qur’aan” [al-Hijr:87]. This is in reference to Soorah al-Faatihah because it consists of seven aayaat and they are repeated in every rak‘ah of prayer. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam) also said in reference to Soorah al-Faatihah, “It is the seven frequently repeated and the tremendous Qur’aan which I have been given.”[7]<br /><br />It is also called as-Salaah (the Prayer) as in the qudsee narration where Allaah says, “I have divided as-Salaah between myself and my worshipping servant into two halves…”[8] and as-Salaah was then explained as being al-Faatihah.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4- Number of Aayaat</span></strong><br /><br />The soorah contains seven aayaat based on the aforementioned statement of Allaah,<br /><br />“And We have granted you seven which are frequently repeated, and the tremendous Qur’aan.”<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation”</ul></span></em> is one aayah;<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“The Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful”</ul></span></em> is the second;<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“Owner and Sovereign of the Day of Reckoning”</ul></span></em> is the third;<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek assistance”</ul></span></em> is the fourth;<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“Guide us to the straight path”</ul></span></em> is the fifth;<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favor”</ul></span></em> is the sixth; and<br /><br /><ul><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Not those who have earned wrath, and not those who have gone astray”</span></em> is the seventh. This is the view held by the majority of scholars regarding the number of its aayaat. However, ash-Shaafi‘ee held the view that</ul><br /><ul><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favor, not those who have earned wrath, and not those who have gone astray”</span></em> altogether is the seventh aayah, and that</ul><br /><ul><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful”</span></em> is the first aayah of the soorah.</ul><br />Due to this difference, in some copies of the mus-haf, the number one is written at the end of the basmalah, like this:<br /><br />indicating that it is one of the aayaat of Soorah al-Faatihah. In other copies of the mus-haf, there is no number written after it, conforming with the view that it is not an aayah from Soorah al-Faatihah. <br /><br />Thus, the basmalah is an aayah from the soorah according to ash-Shaafi‘ee, while the majority of scholars hold the view that it is not an aayah from Soorah al-Faatihah or any other soorah, with the exception of the aayah in Soorah an-Naml<br /><br />“It is from Sulaymaan, and it is in the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the especially Merciful,” [an-Naml:30], where it is a portion of that aayah by unanimous scholarly consensus.<br /><br />Other than what has been mentioned, the basmalah is an independent aayah which is not specific to any soorah. This is why the number one will not be found written after it in any soorah except for al-Faatihah. The basmalah was revealed as an individual aayah which is a sort of partition between each soorah and the one before it. Thus, it is at the beginning of each soorah except for Soorah Baraa’ah because it was not revealed to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam) at the beginning of that soorah, while it was revealed to him for every other soorah. One of the possible reasons which has been suggested for that is because Baraa’ah is a continuation of Soorah al-Anfaal. It has also been suggested that its contents have to do with combat and punishment, and it begins with baraa’ah – Allaah absolving Himself and His Messenger from the mushrikeen – and mentioning mercy before such a declaration would not be suitable; and Allaah knows best.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5- Explanation of the Isti ‘aathah and Basmalah</span></strong><br /><br />I seek refuge in Allaah from ash-shaytaan ar-rajeem<br /><br />This phrase is, without doubt, not part of al-Faatihah. It is only said in fulfillment of the command of Allaah<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“And when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from ash-shaytaan ar-rajeem”</span></em> [an-Nahl:98]. Thus, when a Muslim wishes to recite the Qur’aan he should say a‘oothu billaahi min as-shaytaan ar-rajeem at the onset of his recitation.<br /><br />A‘oothu means: I seek refuge with Allaah, Most Glorious and Most High, and I seek His protection from this enemy, shaytaan.<br /><br />Shaytaan refers to any completely rebellious, disobedient being, whether human, jinn, or animal. It is either derived from shaata which means to become severe, or from shatana which means to be distanced, and that is because the shaytaan is distanced and far removed from any type of good.<br /><br />Rajeem means something which is hurled or cast out, since flames from the heavens are hurled at the shayaateen and they are unable to listen to things that are said there. They are also cast out by the mention and remembrance of Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted. Thus, shaytaan is driven out and away from all forms of good, and the Muslim must take recourse to His Lord and seek refuge with Him from shaytaan so as not to be harmed. The Muslim must also seek refuge with Allaah from the hamz, nafkh, and nafth of shaytaan as has been narrated from the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam).[9]<br /><br />Hamz can refer to possession, since shaytaan may sometimes take control of a person and he may become insane. This type of possession is something that comes from shaytaan, as Allaah says<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“…a person driven by shaytaan to insanity”</span></em> [al-Baqarah:275]. Thus, shaytaan enters a person and pervades his body just as his own blood does, and shaytaan may sometimes take possession of a person. Thus, if Allaah does not protect someone from shaytaan, he can harm the person with whisperings, misconceptions, and even possession leading to insanity.<br /><br />Nafkh refers to haughtiness and arrogance which are things that come from shaytaan since he blows into a person and inflates his ego and sense of conceited pride.<br /><br />Nafth refers to rhymes and poetry. Allaah has said,<br /><br />“and the poets are followed by people who are astray” [ash-Shu‘araa’:224]. Rhymes and poetry are from shaytaan, unless they are clean and have good contents and meanings; in this case they would be praiseworthy. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassllam) said, “Some types of speech can captivate and put the listener into a trance; and some types of poetry contain profound wisdom.”[10] However, the majority of rhymes and poetry are of a bad nature, and they are from the nafth of shaytaan.<br /><br />Nafth can also refer to magic and witchcraft. Allaah has said,<br /><br /><ul><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“…and from the evil of those who blow upon knots”</span></em> [al-Falaq:4].</ul><br />It is mustahabb to say the isti‘aathah before recitation both in and out of salaah based on the statement of Allaah,<br /><br />“And when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from ash-shaytaan ar-rajeem,” and this applies to all circumstances in general, whether performing salaah or not.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful</ul></span></strong><br /><br />The letter baa in the basmalah signifies seeking assistance from Allaah. Thus, the intended meaning is: I seek assistance with the name of Allaah, or I seek protection with the name of Allaah. Also, the word ism (name) here is mufrad (singular) and it is in a construction of idaafah which entails that it applies to all the names that Allaah possesses. Thus, the meaning conveyed would be: I seek refuge with and seek good from all the names of Allaah, the Most Perfect and Exalted. All of the names of Allaah contain infinite good, and are used in order to attain good. Allaah has said,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“And infinite goodness is in the names of Your Lord, the Owner of all Glory and Bounty”</span></em> [ar-Rahmaan:78]. Also, part of what the Prophet r said while supplicating at the beginning of salaah is, “wa tabaarakasmuka (and Your names contain all good)”. Hence, the name of Allaah is something by which you attain all forms of good, and this is what you seek by all the names of Allaah. When yousay bismillaah, the letter baa and the word ism after it are linked to words which are omitted, and we infer these as being: I seek good from, and seek refuge with, the names of Allaah.<br /><br />The word Allaah is the proper name which applies to the supreme being who is the one deserving of all worship. Allaah is one of His greatest names and it conveys the meaning of the one who is to be deified and worshipped. Thus, Allaah is the one deserving of worship, and the one to be sought out in fulfilling all of one’s needs.<br /><br />Ar-Rahmaan is a name of Allaah which entails His attribute of mercy, and ar-Raheem is also a name of Allaah which entails His attribute of mercy. Therefore, ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem are both names of Allaah, and rahmah (mercy) is one of His attributes. Each name of Allaah denotes a certain one of His attributes.<br /><br />The distinction between ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem is that the former refers to His mercy which is general and encompasses all of His creation, while the latter refers to His mercy which He bestows upon the people of eemaan specifically, as He has stated,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“ever merciful to the Mu’mineen”</span></em> [al-Ahzaab:43].<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6- Explanation of the Aayaat in Soorah al-Faatihah</span></strong><br /><br /><em><strong><ul>All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation</ul></strong></em><br /><br />Al-Hamd is praise of Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted. Allaah is praised for His names, attributes, and actions. Hamd (praise) is more comprehensive in meaning than shukr (gratitude), since shukr is only offered for actions. As for hamd, it is given for names, attributes, and actions. Thus hamd is more comprehensive than shukr, and this is the distinction between the two terms.<br /><br />The al in al-hamdu lillaahi conveys the idea that all forms of praise are due to Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted; they all belong to Him and He deserves them. Nothing deserves all praise in an absolute sense besides Allaah, Most Majestic and Exalted, because He is the one that bestows all blessings in an absolute sense, and it follows that praise belongs to Him absolutely. Thus, al-hamdu lillaahi means that all forms of praise are due to Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted.<br /><br />As for any created being, it can only be praised in proportion to the good that emanates from it; however, since Allaah is the one who put the good in that created being, the origin of that praise still returns back to Allaah, Most Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />The Rabb is the one who nurtures His creatures with His blessings and has complete dominion over them all. Rabb refers to the one who nurtures. It further refers to the one who owns, as Allaah is the owner of all creation. It also refers to the one that renders everything in order and puts everything in its suitable place, as Allaah is the one who sets things in order for His worshipping servants. The term ar-Rabb in a definitive sense is not to be used to refer to anything except Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted. Rabb may be used in a restricted, limited sense to refer to other things, as in a construction which expresses ownership such as the rabb of a house, or the rabb of a set of camels, referring to the owner. However, ar-Rabb and Rabb al-‘Aalameen are to be used in reference to Allaah only, and it is incorrect to describe anything else with these terms.<br /><br />Al-‘Aalameen is the plural of ‘aalam which refers to everything besides Allaah. This covers many realms, including humans, jinn, angels, inanimate objects, animals and others. Only Allaah knows all the realms that exist within the creation; all of them comprise ‘aalameen, and Allaah is their Rabb and nothing is excluded from this quality He has over them.<br /><br /><strong><em><ul><span style="color: #0000FF">The Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful</span></ul></em></strong><br />Ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem were already discussed in the explanation of the basmalah.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>Owner and Sovereign of the Day of Reckoning</ul></span></em></strong><br /><br />There are some recitations which say Maalik and others which say Malik. Both are valid, and Allaah is the Maalik (Sole Owner) as well as the Malik (Supreme Sovereign).<br /><br />Ad-Deen refers to being held accountable and also being recompensed for one’s deeds. Allaah has said,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“No! On the contrary, you deny ad-deen,”</span></em> [al-Infitaar:9] and also,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Have you seen the person who denies ad-deen?”</span></em> [al-Maa‘oon:1] and also,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“So what is it that would still cause you to deny ad-deen after all this?”</span></em> [at-Teen:7]. All of these are in reference to denying being held accountable and recompensed for deeds, and being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection.<br /><br />Despite Allaah being the Sole Owner and Supreme Sovereign of all days, the Day of ad-Deen was specifically mentioned because no one will own anything or have authority over anything on that day except Allaah, as He has said,<br /><br />“To whom belongs all dominion on this day? To Allaah, the Unique, the One who Overpowers all else” [Ghaafir:16]. On that day, rulers and subjects will all be equal, and none will have any sort of authority except Allaah, Most Majestic and Exalted. This is the significance of making specific reference to Allaah being the only owner and authority on the Day of ad-Deen – despite Him having that quality for all other days as well – since authority will be removed from everyone else but Him. This is also in line with the hadeeth which mentions that Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted, will say, “I am the Sole Sovereign! Where are the prideful? Where are the haughty?”11 similar to the aforementioned statement of Allaah,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“To whom belongs all dominion on this day? To Allaah, the Unique, the One who Overpowers all else”</span></em> [Ghaafir:16]. All people will be equals on that day: kings, slaves, nobles, impoverished, and affluent. None will have any distinction over another except by way of righteous deeds.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek assistance</ul></span></em></strong><br /><br />Iyyaka na‘budu means we specify You with acts of worship. Iyyaka was put first to convey the idea that the worship is being directed only to Allaah, and none else deserves worship except Him. This construction falls under what is called hasr in the Arabic language, and it conveys the meaning “none deserves to be worshipped except You.”<br /><br />Nasta‘een refers to seeking assistance, and doing so is itself an act of worship. Therefore, why was it specifically mentioned despite it being part of what preceded in the phrase iyyaka na‘budu? Scholars have explained that this is a case of first mentioning something comprehensive and then mentioning a specific instance of it afterwards. Worship is the right of Allaah, while receiving assistance is the right of His servants, since it is the creation that seeks assistance from Allaah and asks of Him to fulfil their needs.<br /><br />Iyyaka was repeated twice to emphasize the fact that nothing deserves to be worshipped except Allaah, and assistance is not to be sought from anything other than Allaah. In fact, all of Islaam revolves around worshipping Allaah and seeking His assistance, which are both in the phrase iyyaka na‘budu wa iyyaka nasta‘een.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>Guide us to the straight path</ul></span></em></strong><br /><br />Ihdinas-siraatal-mustaqeem is a supplication where a request is made. Al-hamdu lillaahi rabbil-‘aalameen at the beginning of the soorah is a supplication of worship. This distinction is made since supplications are of two types: the first is worship, which comprises praise and glorification of Allaah; the second is where a request is made, and an instance of this is from ihdinas-siraatal-mustaqeem until the end of the soorah, where one asks for guidance to the straight path.<br /><br />Ihdinaa is a request for guidance in the form of being shown what is correct. Guidance may be classified into four categories, but the most important of them are two:<br /><br />The first category of guidance is directing someone to what is right. This type of guidance is the more general of them from two perspectives. It is more general from the perspective of the guidance itself, because it is given to both the mu’min and kaafir alike. Allaah has given this type of guidance to the kaafir by showing and directing him to what is correct, as in the statement of Allaah,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“As for Thamood, We gave them direction. However, they preferred blindness over guidance”</span></em> [Fussilat:17]. It is also more general from the perspective of the one providing the guidance and direction, because it includes the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) and those who follow him:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“You indeed guide to a path which is straight”</span></em></span> [ash-Shooraa:52].<br /><br />The second category of guidance is allowing someone to accept what is right. This type of guidance is the more specific of them from the same two perspectives: it is only granted to the mu’min, and it is something which only Allaah can provide. This is why Allaah denied that His Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) could provide this type of guidance, as He stated,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“You cannot guide those whom you love guidance for. Rather, Allaah guides whom He wishes.”</span></em> [al-Qasas:56].<br /><br />Thus, ihdinaa is a request for both types of guidance from Allaah: to be shown and directed to what is right, as well as to be allowed to accept it and remain firm in following it.<br /><br />As-Siraat literally means a path upon which humans and other creatures walk. However, the intended meaning of as-siraat here is the path of Islaam, the Qur’aan, and the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam). These are referred to as paths because each of them is a path that leads to Allaah, Most Perfect and Exalted.<br /><br />Al-Mustaqeem means straight without any divergence, and clear without any obscurity, such that anyone who traverses it would not stray from it or get lost. Contrary to this are the many divergent, crooked paths where one becomes lost and strays from his objective. This is why Allaah said,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“This is My straight path. Therefore, follow it, and do not follow the other paths as they will divert you from His path. This is what He has commanded you in order that you would observe taqwaa”</span></em> [al-An‘aam:153]. Hence, the path of Allaah is one and has no divergence, crookedness, or obscurity, whereas the other divergent paths are crooked and lead one astray – and we seek refuge in Allaah from this. Such is the reason for what the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) did when he recited this aayah: “This is My straight path. Therefore, follow it, and do not follow the other paths…” He drew a straight line and then drew many other divergent lines off to its right and left. He then said in reference to the straight line, “This is the path of Allaah,” and he said about the other lines, “These are the other paths. Each of them has a shaytaan calling to it.”[12]<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favor</ul></span></em></strong><br /><br />Allaah sometimes ascribes the path to Himself, as in<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“This is My straight path”</span></em> [al-An‘aam:153], as well as<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“You indeed guide to a path which is straight: the path of Allaah.”</span></em> [ash-Shooraa:52-53]. Allaah ascribes the path to Himself because it is the path which leads to Him, and He is the one who has directed all people to it, clarified it, and commanded that it be followed. Thus, its ascription to Allaah shows its honor and distinction, as well as the fact that it leads to Allaah.<br /><br />However, sometimes Allaah ascribes the path to those who follow and traverse it, as in the<br /><br />aayah here in Soorah al-Faatihah, “The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favor.” The path is ascribed to those people because they are the ones who traverse it, contrary to others who follow the divergent paths which cause them to get lost and lead them astray.<br /><br />The favor referred to is that of guiding them to this correct path and allowing them to accept it and follow it, and this is the greatest of favors that someone can have from Allaah. These people have been specified by Allaah in His statement,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger shall be with those upon whom Allaah has bestowed His favor; among the Prophets, the siddeeqeen (who are foremost in affirming the truthfulness of what the Prophets brought), the shuhadaa’ (who are martyred in the path of Allaah), and the saaliheen (who are the righteous worshipping servants of Allaah)…”</span></em> [an-Nisaa’:69]. These are the people who follow this path. The first category comprises the Prophets, and they are the foremost of all who follow it; next are the siddeeqeen, and they are the best of all creation after the Prophets; next are the shuhadaa’ martyred in the path of Allaah, and they come after the siddeeqeen in rank; and next come the saaliheen, and they comprise all the rest of the mu’mineen.<br /><br />Thus, the people who follow this straight path are of levels: first come the Prophets, may Allaah send salaah and salaam upon them all; next come the siddeeqeen; next come the shuhadaa’; and next come the saaliheen from every people and nation.<br /><br />We implore Allaah to make us all followers of this straight path and place us in the company of those aforementioned people,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“and they are certainly fine company to be part of”</span></em> [an-Nisaa’:69]. However, when a person traverses that straight path, he may find pressures, problems, and harms in this world, and he may feel estranged and alone. People may physically harm him, or perhaps mock at him, or threaten and insult him. Yet, when he calls to mind the company he is in – those upon whom Allaah has bestowed His favor – he finds tranquility and he can persevere through whatever he faces along the way. The path he traverses is surrounded by hardships and adverse circumstances, and it is not a bed of roses. It is, thus, necessary for you to follow and traverse it persevering with great patience and firm resolve, and one of the things which will assist you in doing so is to realize you are in the company of those aforementioned people. However, this is something which requires eemaan, and few are those who are guided to this reality.<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“None would be guided to these qualities except those who persevere, and none would be guided to them except those who have a tremendous portion”</span></em> [Fussilat:35].<br /><br />The people upon whom Allaah has bestowed His favor are those who have beneficial knowledge and perform righteous actions, among the Prophets, siddeeqeen, shuhadaa’, and saaliheen.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>Not those who have earned wrath, and not those who have gone astray</ul></span></em></strong><br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Not those who have earned wrath”</span></em> refers to those who have knowledge but do not act accordingly. They are people who have beneficial knowledge and understanding, yet they do not perform the deeds which are in conformity with the knowledge they have. Thus, they earn wrath since they disobey Allaah while fully aware of what they are doing. This description applies to all who do not act in conformity with their knowledge, and at the head of such people are the yahood since they had knowledge, and Allaah described them as people of scripture and people who possessed knowledge. However, they did not act in accordance with their knowledge, and this earned them the wrath of Allaah. Yet, it must be kept in mind  that all this is not specific to them alone; rather, it is general and applies to anyone who follows that same course of acquiring knowledge but not acting in accordance with it.[13]<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Not those who have gone astray”</span></em> refers to those who act without having necessary knowledge, since acting in such away shows that they are not following any type of guidance. They are like a person who wanders about not knowing where he is going. When someone wanders about the Earth without knowing where to go or which path to follow is he not referred to – in a literal sense – as being lost or straying? Is it not also perhaps said that he is putting himself in great danger? Similarly, when someone acts without necessary knowledge, he is astray – and we seek refuge in Allaah from this. This is the case even if a person performs many deeds, puts himself through great hardship, wails and weeps, earnestly desires Jannah, and thinks he is drawing closer to Allaah. The fact that he did not traverse the right path will prevent him from reaching his destination. The phrase “those who have gone astray” includes the nasaaraa due to them acting without knowledge, and it also includes people who follow various superstitions and innovated acts ascribed to Islaam, since their actions are not based upon knowledge.<br /><br />Hence, when someone prays or recites this soorah, he is asking Allaah to protect him from these two categories of people: those who possess knowledge but to not act in conformity with it, and those who act without having necessary knowledge.<br /><br />There are currently certain groups and organizations which discourage people from knowledge and being educated. They tell people to engage themselves with certain acts of worship or words of remembrance, and to set out with them “fee sabeelillaah” as they put it. However, what they really mean by “fee sabeelillaah” is to merely travel to various places and move about, while they discourage people from learning and they belittle knowledge and the people who have it! This approach is misguidance, and we seek refuge with Allaah from it. It is necessary to have knowledge first, based on the statement of Allaah,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Have knowledge that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and seek forgiveness for your sin”</span></em> [Muhammad:19] where He began with knowledge before statement and action.<br /><br />The aforementioned aayaat from Soorah al-Faatihah show that people fall into three categories with respect to knowledge and deeds:<br /><br />Those who combine beneficial knowledge with righteous deeds are the ones upon whom Allaah bestows His favor. It is their path which you ask Allaah to guide you to follow when you recite this soorah.<br /><br />Then, those who have knowledge but neglect deeds, and these are the people who have earned wrath, regardless of what affiliation they have or what religion they ascribe to. There are also those who take action and perform deeds, but without having any knowledge, and these are the people who are astray. Both of these categories have lost out, and we ask Allaah to protect us from that.<br /><br />Thus, if you reflect upon this soorah, you should realize how profoundly important it truly is, and realize that Allaah did not designate it to be recited in every rak‘ah of prayer except due to its outstanding significance over every other soorah.<br /><br />Another aspect of this significance is the tremendous supplication which the soorah contains:<br />a supplication of praise and worship at the beginning, and a supplication of request at the end. The<br />entire soorah is a supplication, and this is why it is mustahabb for the imaam, ma’moom, and munfarid to say aameen after reciting it while praying. Aameen means “O Allaah, respond to this supplication.” It is a request for Allaah to respond to the supplication in this soorah. Although it is not waajib to say aameen while praying, it remains mustahabb for the imaam, ma’moom, and munfarid to say aameen aloud if the recitation in prayer is aloud, and to say it silently if the recitation is silent.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7- Some Merits of the Soorah</span></strong><br /><br />One of the merits which shows the significance of this soorah is reported in a qudsee narration collected in Saheeh Muslim where Allaah says, “I have divided as-Salaah between myself and My worshipping servant into two halves, and My servant shall have what he requests.” The intended meaning of “as-Salaah” here is Soorah al-Faatihah, which is named as-Salaah due to it being recited during prayer (as-Salaah), as well as the fact that as-Salaah literally means supplication (ad-Du‘aa’), and Soorah al-Faatihah is a supplication.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that the soorah contains seven aayaat, the statement “between myself and My worshipping servant into two halves” means that three-and-a-half of the aayaat are for Allaah, and three-and-a-half are for the servant.<br /><br />When he says, “All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation,” Allaah, Most Exalted, says, “My servant has praised Me.”<br /><br />When he says, “The Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful,” Allaah, Most Exalted, says, “My servant has glorified Me.”<br /><br />When he says, “Owner and Sovereign of the Day of Reckoning,” Allaah, Most Exalted, says, “My servant has extolled Me.”<br /><br />When he says, “You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek assistance,” Allaah, Most Exalted, says, “This is between Myself and My servant, and My servant shall have what he requests.”<br /><br />“You alone we worship” is for Allaah, while “and from You alone we seek assistance” is for the servant. Therefore, the portion for the servant is from “and from You alone we seek assistance” until the end of the soorah because he supplicates his Lord here. Whereas, the portion for Allaah is from “All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation…” until up to “You alone we worship” because this is all praise for Allaah, Most Majestic and Exalted. All this reflects the true greatness of this soorah.<br /><br />Thus, when the servant then says “Guide us to the straight path; the path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favor, not those who have earned wrath, and not those who have gone astray,” Allaah then says, “This is for My servant, and My servant shall have what he requests.”[14]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">8- Other Points Gleaned from the Soorah</span></strong><br /><br />Among the things which further demonstrate the significance of this soorah are statements the scholars have made about the tremendously profound meanings which it contains.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Firstly</span></strong>, it affirms the three categories of tawheed. “All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation” reflects tawheed ar-ruboobiyyah. “The Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful. Owner and Sovereign of the Day of Reckoning” reflects tawheed al-asmaa’ was-sifaat. “You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek assistance” reflects tawheed al-uloohiyyah. Thus, it contains reference to the three categories of tawheed.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Secondly</span></strong>, it affirms that Messengers were sent. “Rabb of all creation” affirms the ruboobiyyah of Allaah, and that implies that He would not neglect His servants, leaving them without the things which would lead to their betterment. One of the things that would be most advantageous for them is to send Messengers to them, and this is evident in the statement “Guide us to the straight path” since that path cannot be clearly distinguished without sending Messengers to mankind. Thus, it contains reference to Messengers being sent.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Thirdly</span></strong>, it disproves the various misguided factions.<br /><br />It disproves the ideas of the mulhideen, who deny the existence of a supreme Lord altogether. “Rabb of all creation” disproves those who claim that this world has no supreme Lord and it is the creation which makes itself, and nature which originates everything. Such a claim defies the intellect, since every created thing must have a maker, and it is not possible for things to happen within this creation without some agent to make them happen. All things in this world are indicative of their Creator, Most Perfect and Exalted, and indicative of the fact that He is the one who brought them into being and regulates them.<br /><br />It also disproves the ideas of the mushrikeen, who believe in a supreme Lord, yet still worship others along with Him. “All praise is due to Allaah, Rabb of all creation”, “You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek assistance”, and “Guide us to the straight path” all disprove the idea of worshipping Allaah while also worshipping others at the same time.<br /><br />It also disproves certain ideas of the jahmiyyah, mu‘tazilah, and others deny the attributes of Allaah.<br /><br />It further disproves those who deny being brought back to life after passing on from this world. “Owner and Sovereign of the Day of Reckoning” refers to the day when everyone will be taken to account and given fair recompense. Thus, it affirms being brought back to life after death.<br /><br />It disproves the methods followed by the yahood and nasaaraa as well as others who either follow the course of having knowledge but not acting in conformity with it, or follow the course of taking action without having sound knowledge. Thus, it reprimands any knowledgeable person who does not act in conformity to his knowledge, as well as anyone who takes action without basing it on sound knowledge.<br /><br />This is why scholars have said this soorah disproves all the various factions there are. Thus, it deserves to be called Umm al-Kitaab because the Umm of any unit is the thing which all the components of that unit return back to and revolve around; and all of the Qur’aan returns back to this soorah since all of Qur’aan revolves around the meanings which this soorah contains.<br /><br />This magnificent soorah is recited and repeated by multitudes of people, but that may merely be done verbally without having any concept or comprehension of what it actually means. To such people, it is merely something they say as if it were a formula in a foreign language. This is dreadfully incorrect and it is a devastating shortcoming, as the Qur’aan was revealed for us to reflect upon it and understand what it means.<br /><br />And Allaah knows best, and may He send salaah and salaam upon our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions.<br /><br />Note: referencing for narrations mentioned in this booklet were taken from Duroos min al-Qur’aan al-Kareem, also by the same author, published by Daar al-‘Aasimah.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnoes: </span></strong><br /><br />1.

Al-Haakim said it is saheeh al-isnaad and that al-Bukhaaree and Muslim did not collect it in their respective books. It was also collected by ibn Maajah in his introduction from Jaabir, chapter 1, number 11, [1/15].<br /><br />13. [Publisher’s note] In the author’s book, al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhee, he also mentioned in the section about the merits of acquiring knowledge of Islaam (pg.9) that Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab said, “In the statement of Allaah ‘not those who have earned wrath, and not those who have gone astray’ the ones who earn wrath are people who do not act according to what they know, while the ones who go astray are people who act without having any knowledge. The first applies to the yahood and the second applies to the nasaaraa. However, when an ignorant person reads in tafseer that the yahood are the ones who earned wrath and the nasaaraa are the ones who went astray, he thinks those descriptions apply only to them and no one else. Yet, he also reads that his Lord has obligated making this supplication and seeking refuge from following the ways of such people. Subhaanallaah! Is it conceivable that Allaah would teach someone this supplication, specifically choose it for him to say, and obligate that he always supplicate his Lord using it, while there is no danger of the person himself having such characteristics? Compounding things is that the person doesn’t even realize that this way of thinking reflects that he actually thinks ill of Allaah.” The author then commented that, in the cited passage, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab explained to us some of the wisdom behind the obligation of reciting Soorah al-Faatihah in every rak‘ah of prayer, whether obligatory or optional. It is due to the profound meanings which this tremendous soorah contains, and one of them is a person supplicating Allaah to guide him to the path of those who have beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds, since that is the path that would save him in this world and the hereafter. In addition, it also contains supplicating Allaah to keep one away from the path of those who have destroyed themselves as a result of neglecting either righteous deeds or beneficial knowledge.<br /><br />14. Collected by Muslim from Aboo Hurayrah in Kitaab as-Salaah, chapter 11, number 395, [2/324].<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Publisher’s note]</span></strong> In Madaarij as-Saalikeen (1/22-23) ibn al-Qayyim states, “Since asking Allaah for guidance to the straight path is the loftiest objective there is, and nothing better can be attained than it, Allaah taught His worshipping servants how to ask of Him. He commanded them to first begin by praising and extolling Him, and then to make mention of their worshipping servitude to Him alone. These two – using His names and attributes, as well as using His sole right to their worshipping servitude – are means to achieving their objective, and a supplication would almost never be rejected when the two of them are used together. Soorah al-Faatihah combines both of these: seeking means to Allaah by praising and extolling Him, and seeking means to Him by affirming His sole right to be worshipped. After using those two means comes the request for guidance, which is the objective of utmost importance and it is the best thing one can seek after. Thus, when someone calls upon Allaah like this, he deserves to be answered.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 07, 2017 12:35 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">From The Secrets Of Fatiha And What It Contains</span></strong><br /><em>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi -Rahimullaah-</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Two Strengths</span></strong><br /><br />‘The human being has two strengths:<br /><br />The strength of researched knowledge.<br /><br />And the strength of practical firm determination of actions.<br /><br />A human’s complete happiness is dependent upon the perfection and completion of the two strengths of knowledge and firm determination of actions.<br /><br />As for the perfection and completion of the strength of knowledge, then this is achieved by knowing his Creator and his Originator, knowing His Names and Attributes; by knowing the path which leads to Him, and by knowing what causes weakness in following that path, and by knowing himself and his shortcomings and mistakes.<br /><br />Having awareness of these five points, leads the human to achieve perfection in the strength of knowledge. The most knowledgeable of the people are those who know and understand these points the most.<br /><br />As for the perfection and completion of the strength of practical firm determination of actions, this can only be achieved by complying with the rights of Allaah -Subhanahu- which He has over the slave, and the slave fulfills them with Ikhlaas (sincerity), truthfulness, faithfully, being righteous and by following and testifying to Allaah’s favours upon the slave of Allaah.<br /><br />The slave has shortcomings in fulfilling Allaah’s rights, and so is ashamed to face Allaah with what (little) he has from servitude to Him. The slave knows that his servitude to Allaah is less than that which Allaah is worthy of, in fact it is even less and lesser than that.  There is no way for him to perfect these two strengths except with Allaah’s help.  Allaah guides him to the straight path to which He guided, His ‘Aawliyaa and those who are close to Him. Allaah averts him from going off the path (Siraat), through either becoming corrupted in his strength of knowledge, and he falls into misguidance, or from his strength of actions, which obligates anger upon him.<br /><br /> <br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Principles of Guidance in Sooratul – Fatiha</span></strong><br /><br />The complete happiness of a human cannot be achieved except with a combination of these matters, and they are included in Sooratul Fatiha and these matters are arranged in the best way, so the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;All praise belongs to Allaah, the Lord of all the worlds * The Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.  * The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)&gt;&gt; comprises the first principle, which is knowing about Allaah and His Names, His Attributes and His Actions.<br /><br />The Names mentioned in this Soorah are the principle names of Allaah’s Beautiful Names, which are; the Name ‘Allaah’, ‘ar-Rabb’ (The Lord) and ‘ar-Rahmaan’ (The Most Merciful).<br /><br />The Name ‘Allaah’ comprises the attributes of al-Ulooheeya (worship).<br /><br />The Name ‘ar-Rabb’ comprises the attributes of Roobubeeyah.<br /><br />The Name ‘ar-Rahman’ comprises the attributes of Beneficence, generosity and Kindness.<br /><br />The meanings of the Names of Allaah revolve around this.<br /><br />As for Allaah’s saying:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)&gt;&gt; : This is knowing the path leading to Allaah, which is none other than worshipping Him Alone with what Allaah loves and is pleased with, and seeking aid from Him whilst worshipping Him.<br /><br />As for His saying: &lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way &gt;&gt; this comprises the explanation that the slave of Allaah has no way to his own happiness except by Isteeqamah (being upright) on the Siraat al-Mustaqeem (the straight path).  There is no path for him to Isteeqamah except by Allaah’s guidance, just as there is no way for him to Allaah’s worship except by Allaah’s aid, in the same way there is no path for him to Isteeqamah upon the correct way except by Allaah’s guidance.<br /><br />As for Allaah’s saying: &lt;&lt; not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray&gt;&gt; this contains the two extremities of deviancy from the straight path.  Deviating to one of these sides leads to misguidance, which is the corruption of knowledge and belief deviating to the other side, to Allaah’s anger which is due to corruption of the intention and action.<br /><br />The first part of the Soorah is mercy, the middle is guidance and last part is blessings.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Slave of Allaah is between Blessings and Guidance</span></strong><br /><br />The portion of blessings a slave of Allaah has is related to the amount of guidance he has.<br /><br />The proportion of guidance for a slave of Allaah is related to the portion of Mercy. So, the whole matter returns back to Allaah’s Blessings and His Mercy.<br /><br />Blessing and Mercy are from those things which necessitate Allaah’s Roobubeeyah (Lordship). Indeed Allaah is The Merciful and The Giver of blessings and these are from the obligations of His Ilaheeyaeehi (being the One worthy of worship), so He is the deity in Truth, even if the rejecters deny it, and the Mushrikeen associate partners with Him.<br /><br />Whoever puts into effect the meanings of Fatiha with knowledge and understanding, practically and immediately; then he will have been successful in his perfecting [knowledge and action] in the best way. Then his worship of Allaah becomes a distinct worship by which his grade is raised above that of the general worshippers.<br /><br />Wa Allaahul Must’aan.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Taken From his book ‘Al-Fawaid’ p.115-118]</span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/from-the-secrets-of-fatiha-and-what-it-contains/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... -contains/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 07, 2017 12:01 am</p><hr />

And if he passed by an Ayaah which mention the Hell-Fire he would stop, supplicate and seek Allaah’s forgiveness.’<br /><br /><em>[‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />7 – From Nafa’ who said:<br /><br />‘Ibn Umar never ever read these two Ayaat from the last part of Soorah Baqarah except that he would cry:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;وَإِن تُبۡدُواْ مَا فِيٓ أَنفُسِكُمۡ أَوۡ تُخۡفُوهُ يُحَاسِبۡكُم بِهِ ٱللَّهُۖ&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. &gt;&gt; then he would say: ‘Indeed this is a severe level of accountability.’<br /><br /><em>[al-Hileeyah]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />8 – From Ibn Mas’ood –Radi Allaahu anhu– who said:<br /><br />‘Be continuous in looking into the Mus’haf (the Qur’aan).’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />9 – From Yunus bin Jubayr who said:<br /><br />‘Jundub accompanied us until we reached the edge of the town and we said, advise us.’<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />‘I advise you to have fear of Allaah and I advise you with the Qur’aan, since it is light on a dark night, and the brightness of the day.’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Taken From: ‘Min Ahkbar as-Salaf’ p.100]</span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/some-narrations-regarding-reading-the-quraan-reflecting-upon-it/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... g-upon-it/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Mar 06, 2017 11:55 pm</p><hr />

Therefore if we wish to be guided we ask Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – to grant us the ability to be guided and then we act upon what we learn from the Sunnah.<br /><br />Allaah tells us clearly in the Quran:<br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt;’He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad) has indeed obeyed Allaah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (Muhammad) as a watcher over them.’&gt;&gt; [Nisa’: 80]</ul><br />And the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- told us:<br /><br />‘I have left you upon the shining path, its night is like its day. No one will deviate from it except that he wishes to be destroyed.’<br /><br />‘صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ’ – The Path which you have blessed<br /><br />The Arabic word An’amta (those who have been blessed) comes from the word Na’amah which means blessed therefore the one who is blessed is called Mun’im (One who is blessed). To be Munim (one who is blessed) you must possess knowledge and you must act upon that knowledge. This is one group of people.<br /><br />‘غَيۡرِ ٱلۡمَغۡضُوبِ عَلَيۡهِمۡ’ – Not those with whom Allaah is angry<br /><br />This is another group of people and they possess knowledge but they do not act upon the knowledge they have, therefore they are like donkeys merely carrying the load of books but not implementing the knowledge within those books.<br /><br />‘وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ’ – And not those who have gone astray<br /><br />This is the last group and they have no knowledge and worship Allaah with Bid’ah (innovations) and whilst following their desires. They perform much worship however it is not according to the Sunnah therefore it is not correct nor is it accepted.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Summary of Some Benefits from Soorah Fatiha - Part One</span></strong><br /><em>By AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Umm Yahya</em><br /><br />AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr mentioned:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Benefits of Surah Fatiha</span></strong><br /><br />Whilst reciting this Soorah Fatiha in their prayer Muslims must be aware of the weight and value of this Great Soorah. They must understand it, reflect upon it and then act upon the conditions and pillars which are erected from this Soorah. Acting upon it also involves action of the heart, as it should feel particular emotions in response to what is being recited.<br /><br />‘ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٢’ – All praise belongs to Allaah Lord of all the worlds<br /><br />Whilst reciting this a slave should feel love for Allaah Ta’ala, who alone is worthy of all Praise as He alone created all that exists. He alone granted us all the blessings that we have, those that we are aware of and those we are not aware of.<br /><br />‘ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٣’ – The Most Kind the Most Merciful<br /><br />Whilst reciting this a slave should feel hope, knowing that Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – is the Most Kind and most Merciful, thus He alone will forgive our sins regardless of their amount or severity as long as we repent with sincerity.<br /><br />‘مَٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ ٤’ – The Master of the Day of Judgment<br /><br />Whilst reciting this Soorah a slave should feel fear. Knowing that on that day we will be taken to account for all our deeds even an atom’s worth. Retribution will be taken for those we oppressed or wronged, and punishment given for sins committed that were not repented from with sincerity.<br /><br />These three emotions, Love, Hope and Fear are known as the pillars of Worship of the Heart, together they constitute worship. We worship Allaah Ta’ala with all three of these pillars, Love, Hope and Fear. If one feels any of these pillars for other than Allaah then it is Shirk. (Placing partners with Allaah)<br /><br />Various deviant sects worship Allaah whilst adhering to just one of these pillars and thus have gone astray, it is vital to possess all three pillars. If there is only Hope he will not stop sinning due to lack of Fear, if there is only Fear he will give up his good deeds as he does not have Hope, if there is only Love he will not Fear Allaah’s punishment and continue to sin.<br /><br />‘إِيَّاكَ نَعۡبُدُ’ -You alone we worship<br /><br />This statement is a realization of La illaah ila Allaah (there is none worthy of worship except Allaah). Thus this is a contract between Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – and the worshipper to worship Allaah alone, once this principle of making all worship for Allaah alone is comprehended a slave would never raise his hands or perform an act of worship for other than Allaah.<br /><br />‘وَإِيَّاكَ نَسۡتَعِينُ’ – You alone we turn to, seeking help<br /><br />This statement is a realization of La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa, (There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah). This testifies that Allaah alone possesses the unique qualities of Giving and Taking etc therefore we only ask Allaah to fulfill all of our needs as He alone is able to grant them. As is mentioned in the Hadeeth of Ibn Abbas -Radi Allaahu anhu-, who said: One day I was behind the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and he said to me:<br /><br />‘Young boy, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: Be mindful of Allaah, and Allaah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of Allaah; if you seek help, seek help of Allaah.<br /><br />Know that if the Ummah were to gather together to benefit you with anything, it would benefit you only with something that Allaah had already prescribed for you, and that if they gather together to harm you with anything, they would harm you only with something Allaah had already prescribed for you.
