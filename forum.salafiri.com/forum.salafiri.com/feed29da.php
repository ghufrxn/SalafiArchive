<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</span></strong><br /><br />What the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">atheists</span></strong> of this era believe in, such as the followers of <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Marx, Lenin</span></strong> and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">socialism, communism, ba’athism</span></strong> or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty.
