				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Satan Talking To Imam Ahmed On His Death Bed</span></strong><br /><br />Abdullah bin Ahmed said:<br />“When death approached my father, I sat with him and in my hand was a scrap of cloth with which I wanted to tie his beard and he began to drift in and out of consciousness, then he opened his eyes and said, indicating with his hand: “No, not yet. No, not yet” And he repeated it three times. After the third repetition, I said to him: Oh, my father! What is this thing which you have said at this time? You fall into unconsciousness so that we say that you have gone,then you return (to consciousness) and say: “No, not yet. No, not yet” <br /><br />He said to me: Oh, my son! Do you not know?” I said: “No”. <br /><br />He said:” Satan – May Allah’s curse be upon him – stood before me, he lowered himself on his knuckles and said to me:” Oh, Ahmad! You have eluded me.” But I replied: “No, not yet, not yet until I die.”<br /><br />Source: The biography of Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal by Salahuddin Ali Abdul Mawjood<br />Publisher: Darussalam<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://jinn-devils.abdurrahman.org/2011/09/30/satan-talking-to-imam-ahmed-on-his-death-bed/">http://jinn-devils.abdurrahman.org/2011 ... death-bed/</a><!-- m --></div>
