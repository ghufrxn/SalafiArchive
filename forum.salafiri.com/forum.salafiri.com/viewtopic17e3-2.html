Now, he has a lot of money from that time. He asks, what is upon him as it relates to this money? Is it permissible for him to give charity and make Hajj from it?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #408040">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />This money belongs to him; because Islaam wipes away that which came before it; clear? Al-Islaam wipes away that which came before it. The Prophet, when the disbelievers of the Quraysh would embrace Al-Islaam, no doubt they had many impermissible dealings; clear? Yet he did not command them to get rid of their wealth which was derived from Haraaam.<br /><br />Question asked and Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts<br />3 Rajab 1433/ May 25, 2012<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/haraam-money-from-before-islaam-by-shaykh-abd">http://mtws.posthaven.com/haraam-money- ... shaykh-abd</a><!-- m --></div>
