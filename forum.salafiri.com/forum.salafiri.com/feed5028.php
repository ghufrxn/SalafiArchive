A lot has been hurled at the rulers of the Muslim countries for not helping the Muslim refugees fleeing their respective countries. May Allah make their affair easy and give them the utmost sabr. Amin.<br /><br />This is not unusual you find the brothers who have not studied the books of aqidah or even the prophetic hadith who habitually hurl abuse at the Muslim rulers and little do they actually know how much the Muslim countries do. They should probably go against the hadith that mentions not one hand knowing from the other with regards to the charity one does. For these people they require mass publicity so they can please their souls<br /><br />A number of observations<br /><br />The Muslims coming to these European countries is better as inshaAllah it will boost the Muslim population and our dawah efforts. As we know from the signs that Islam will enter every household.<br /><br />This is the main reason the european countries are neglecting our Muslim brothers and sisters. However we should know his from our understanding of Al wala wal Bara.<br /><br />Our brothers get so excited with the Europeans ie oh look how good these people are Iceland Germany Austria, the fact of the matter is they see his as an opportunity to convert the Muslims to Christianity of even atheism. Their job is a lot easier, they don't need to do their missionary work, the people are coming to them. Don't be fooled with the toys. Allah has told us about the disbelievers.<br /><br />Instead of hurling abuse at the rulers and saying despicable comments like these filthy Arab rulers Allahul mustan it would be far better to pray for the Muslims make dua for them, engage in powerful deeds and ibadah that bring an ibadi closer to his Rab ie tahajjud and praying in the last part of the night. Again these people fall into the traps of shaytan and his handiwork to just sit behind a screen and hurl accusations.<br />The Muslim that drowns is a shahid. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu alayhi wasallam) said: What do you regard as martyrdom?” They said: Being killed for the sake of Allaah. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu alayhi wasalam) said: “Martyrdom is seven things besides being killed for the sake of Allaah. The one who dies of the plague is a martyr, the one who drowns is a martyr, the one who dies of pleurisy is a martyr, the one who dies of a stomach disease is a martyr, the one who is burned to death is a martyr, the one who dies beneath a collapsed building is a martyr, and the woman who dies in pregnancy is a martyr.” Abu Dawood (3111) and al-Nasaa’i (1846), Ahmad 23804. It is graded sahih by the Albanian Hadith master.<br /><br />Subhanallah all of these people martyrs. Allah has blessed them with this noble status that those who want it cannot get accept with the permission of Allah. The media has depicted and talked about our a sister who gave birth whilst drowning and all the images of the Muslims that drowned.<br /><br />Allah has blessed them with something better than the kufr filled streets of Europe.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 7:19 pm</p><hr />
