				<h3>The Black Faces of the Innovators</h3>

				<div class="content">A very serious and yet simple reason to abstain and warning against innovations,<br /><br />Allah says in the Quran <br /><br /><strong>&quot;On the Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces will turn black.&quot; (Surah Aal-Imran:106)</strong><br /><br />The mufassir of the Quran, about whom our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallm) supplicated to Allah for him to teach Abdullah Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) the Quran (Bukhari) said about this ayah<br /><br />Ibn Abbas who died in 68H said in explanation of this ayah,<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><em>&quot;The white faces refers to Ahlus Sunnah and the black faces refers to Ahlul Bidah.&quot; (Zad al-Masir Fi Ilm at-Tafsir(1/436) of Ibn al-Jawzi, Mau'alim at-Tanzil (1/339) of Baghawi and Qurtubi (4/167) who all narrated it in marfu form</em></div></blockquote><br /><br />There is however some weakness in the chain, However it is supported by a narration Imam Lalikai transmits with addition words in is Sharh Usul (1/72). the addition words are, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamah and Ahlul Bidah Wad-Dalalah ie misguidance.<br /><br />Imam Lalikai also brings another report from Ibn Abbas (RadhiAllahu Anhu) in support of the first report (1/55) however this is also weak. Yet all three support each other as there is weakness in the chain based on memory.<br /><br />Bidah lead to distancing one self from the Quran and Sunnah, opposing the way of the Companions and Salaf and lastly developing pride and arrogance which leads to rejecting the truth.<br /><br />This is very evident from the people around us in our times. We pray Allah that Allah helps us to stay away from bidah and its people so that our faces are not black on the yaum al-Qiyamah. Amin</div>
