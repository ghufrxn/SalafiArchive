May Allaah benefit us with that which we have heard; and may Allaah forgive us, you, and all the Muslims. This questioner, O Shaykh, says: I implore you, by Allaah, to ask this question (for me). He says in his question: O, Shaykh, give me advice, for by Allaah, I am upon the brink of the Hellfire. For I have been addicted, O Shaykh, to pornography websites since last year. Every time I repent I return to it again. By Allaah, the thing which I hate the most is these sites, but they overpower me every time and they are the reason for my failure. I used to be very successful in my work and in my studies, however, now I am in a state of loss.<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br />Firstly, I say, just as ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattaab, may Allaah be pleased with him, has said:<br />“Supplicate to Allaah the Blessed and High that He turns the heart of your brother; that He guides him and accepts his repentance.” So we ask Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, the Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, that He guide him and accept his repentance; and that He makes us and him firm with the firm statement and that He give us refuge from the evil of our souls and the evil of our actions.<br /><br />I advise you, O noble brother, with one piece of advice; always be mindful of it, for in it is salvation for you. It is the greatest admonition. Always bear in mind that Allaah, the Lord of all that exists, sees you and that He, Glorified and Exalted be He, is looking at you. If you are alone within the house on any day, then do not say: I am alone; but say: There is a Raqeeb (Watcher i.e. Allaah) over me. When you sit, in this seclusion with this screen on the internet and you begin to enter those sites and you think that no one from the people can see you, then know that the Lord of all that exists is looking at you.<br /><br /><em>Knows he not that Allaah does see (what he does)? (Al-'Alaq 96:14)</em><br /><br />In this verse is a rebuke for you; treat yourself with it; rebuke yourself by way of the Qur’aan. There is no harm if you put this verse upon your room in front of you so that you can look at it and it can deter you and rebuke you from that matter, which there is not to be seen nor will you find therein any result that will benefit you. Rather, you have been affected in your studies, in your manners, in your worship, in your performance; there is no beneficial fruit in it. This is what the enemies of the religion desire; when they make the likes of these despicable, licentious, and harmful films; so that the children of the Muslims become lost; and the children of the Muslims become like cattle. Rather, they are even more astray; in the following of desires and urges, deviations and misguidances.<br /><br />Due to this, have Taqwaa of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and make yourself constant in turning to Allaah the Glorified and High, and in sincere Tawbah to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />This device, I do not say to you to-if this is your state-to utilize it for permissible affairs; rather, I say: REMOVE IT FROM THE HOUSE COMPLETELY. Remove it from the house completely; and it should not remain with you even for a second. Tonight, remove it from your house; because its presence is an apparent corruption for you. It should not remain with you in hopes of benefitting from it in useful ways. Rather, remove it from your house completely and close off this door of evil from yourself and turn to Allaah the Glorified and High.<br /><br />We ask Allaah to turn your heart and to accept your repentance, and to accept all of our repentance; and to guide us all to the (straight) path; and to rectify for us all of our affairs; indeed He, Blessed and Exalted be He, is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive, and Ever-Near.    <br /><br />Translated by: Raha ibn Donald Batts   <br /><br />Source: <a href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/advice-to-those-who-are-tried-with-watching-porn-by-shaykh-abdur-razzaaq-al-badr" class="postlink">http://mtws.posthaven.com/advice-to-those-who-are-tried-with-watching-porn-by-shaykh-abdur-razzaaq-al-badr</a></div>
