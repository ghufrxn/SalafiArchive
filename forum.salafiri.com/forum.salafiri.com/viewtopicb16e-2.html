When a man meets a brother or a friend, should he bow to him?” He said: “No.” He said: “Should he embrace and kiss him?” He said: “No”. He said: “Should he take hold of his hand and shake his hand?” He said: “Yes”.<br /><br />[Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2728)]<br /><br /><br /><br />Shaikh al-Albaanee said about the hadeeth:<br /><br />“‘Hasan’ without the sentence about embracing”,<br /><br />and he said in as-Saheehah (1/1/301): “As for hugging and embracing, then since the prohibition of it in the hadeeth is not established, then what is obligatory is to remain upon the basic principle, which is permissibility, particularly since that is supported by some ahaadeeth and narrations:<br /><br />So Anas-radiyallaahu `anhu-said: “The Companions of the Prophet _ used to shake hands when they met, and when they arrived back from a journey they would embrace.” Reported by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat, and it narrators are narrators of the Saheeh-just as al-Mundhiree (3/270) and al-Haythamee (8/36) said.<br /><br /><br /><br />And al-Bayhaqee reported (7/100) with a ‘Saheeh’ chain from ash-Sha`bee:<br /><br />“The Companions of Muhammad _ would shake hands when they met, and when they arrived back from a journey they would embrace each other.”<br /><br /><br /><br />And al-Bukhaareee reported in ‘al-Adabul- Mufrad’, and Ahmad (3/495), from Jaabir ibn `Abdullaah:<br /><br />“I heard of a hadeeth from a man who had heard it from Allaah’s Messenger  ﷺ, so I bought a camel, then I tied my saddle upon it, and I travelled for a month until I came to him in ash-Shaam. So I found that it was `Abdullaah ibn `Unays. So I said to the door- keeper: “Say to him: Jaabir is at the door.” So he said: “The son of `Abdullaah?” So I said: “Yes”. So he came out trailing his garment, and he embraced me and I embraced him....”- the hadeeth, and its chain of narration is ‘Hasan’, as al-Haafiz said, and al-Bukhaaree mentioned it in disconnected form.<br /><br />And it is authentic that Ibnut-Tayyihaan embraced the Prophet ﷺ_ when he ﷺ came tomhim on his garden, as occurs in ‘Mukhtasarush-Shaamil (no.113).”<br /><br />Imaam al-Baghawee said in Sharhus-Sunnah (12/293):<br /><br />“As for what is disliked (makrooh) from embracing and kissing, then it is what is done for flattery and giving honour to someone, and in residence; as for what is permitted from it then when bidding farewell, and when arriving back from a journey, and after having not seen a person for a long time, and when having very great love for Allaah’s sake; and whoever kisses then he should not kiss the mouth, but rather the hand, the head, and the forehead.......<br /><br />-at-Teebee said in his explanation of ‘al-Mishkaat’: “And embracing and kissing the face, for other than the one who arrive from a journey and his like, are disliked (makrooh). This was clearly stated by al-Baghaawee and others, because of the authentic hadeeth prohibiting that with a prohibition of dislike...”<br /><br /><br /><br />From Aboo Hurairah-radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: Allaah’s Messenger _ said:<br /><br />“When one of you reaches the gathering he should give the greeting of Salaam, and when he wants to depart he should give the greeting of Salaam; so the first does not have more right than the last.”<br /><br />Reported by Aboo Daawood (no.5208) and at-Tirmidhee (no.2706), and declared ‘Hasan Saheeh’ by Shaikh al-Albaanee.<br /><br />[Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com/">http://www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a><!-- m --></div>
