				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Advice of Shaykh Abu Umar Usaamah Utaybee regarding Facebook</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh Abu Umar Usaamah Utaybee of Madinah hafidhullah said:<br /><br />‎The website facebook is from the immoral and corrupt websites. And it is said that the Jews are behind it, and Allah knows best the truth of this statement. In any case, this does not concern us. That which concerns us is, whether the practices that occur on this website are permissible in the sharee‎ah. As for the use of this website for men to meet women, and the socialisation between sexes as well as the use of this site for other corrupt activities, then this is clearly impermissible.<br /><br />And women are weak and naive, so Messenger (ie. msn) and Chat and other similar websites and programmes harm the society, if they are used between men and women. This is completely and absolutely impermissible, due to women being weak and vulnerable. And how many cases of fornication and divorce and sin have come about due to the use of these sites. And this is something clearly recognized.<br /><br />Facebook came to gather between the evil of all of the previous messaging programmes. So all of these programmes were surpassed by Facebook and it increased upon them (i.e. their evil). Therefore it is an immoral and corrupt website. And if you were to use it to set up a page for Da‎wah, then women would enter upon your page. And this would necessitate socializing with women and speaking to them, and perhaps she may even send you her picture and this is something unavoidable in Facebook. For that reason, the use of this website is impermissible, and I advise the youth that they stay away from it completely, and that they warn against it. And the fact that the sinful people and disbelievers use this website is not a reason for us to also use it, especially when the harm it causes is greater (than the benefit). So I advise you not enter into it.‎<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Brief biography of the Shaykh:</span></strong><br /><br />His full name is Abu Umar Usaamah bin ‘Atayah al-Utaybi.<br /><br />He was born prior to 1395H in Jordan.
