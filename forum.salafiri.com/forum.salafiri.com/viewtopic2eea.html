				<h3>How The Sahaabiyaat Taught Their Children</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Oct 05, 2016 12:55 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Umm ‘Abdillaah al-Waadi’iyyah (hafidhahullaah) gave the example of Umm Sulaym, the mother of Anas (radiallaahu ‘anhumaa) who sent her son to serve the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) at a very young age. He served him for 10 years. He was not a slave. Umm Sulaym encouraged Anas to be with Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). There is no difference between the male and female student of knowledge. Umm Sulaym wanted Anas to get blessings and benefit from the ilm of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). She wanted him to get practical knowledge.<br /><br />Umm ‘Abdillaah gave another example:<br /><br />She spoke about the time when the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent Anas to do something for him. He met his mother on the way and she asked him where he was going. He replied that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent him somewhere. Umm Sulaym then told him to never convey the Prophet’s secrets.<br /><br />The Sahaabiyaat (radhiallaahu ‘anhunna) made their children fast on the Day of Ashoorah. They assisted their children in fasting. When the children would cry for food, the mothers would give them toys so that they would complete the fasting –  and they completed it.<br /><br />The Companions stressed to the children to accompany the scholars.<br /><br />Umm ‘Abdillaah gave the story of Hudhayfah bin Yaman (radiallaahu ‘anhu). He was the only Sahabi who knew the names of the Munaafiqoon (hypocrites) and he kept this secret. ‘Umar al-Farooq (radiallaahu ‘anhu) asked about the list of names, and that Hudhayfah did not reveal what the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told him. So ‘Umar (radiallaahu ‘anhu) asked if he was on the list. Umm ‘Abdur Rahmaan also mentioned the famous narration:<br /><br />“Hudhayfah (radiallaahu ‘anhu) stated that the companions used to ask about the good, but he would ask about the evil so that he would not fall into it.”<br /><br />Hudhayfah was not being consistent with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his mother noticed this. She asked him when was the last time he was with him. She gave him a stern advice.<br /><br />Hudhayfah said,<br /><br />“Enough, enough, I will go to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I will pray Salaatul Maghrib with him then ask him to forgive me.”<br /><br />He prayed behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he did not get a chance to speak with him so he waited until Salaatul ‘Eeshaa. Rasoolullah began to leave and Hudhayfah called him.<br /><br />He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<br /><br />“Is that Hudhayfah?”<br /><br />He replied, “Yes.”<br /><br />Rasoolullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<br /><br />“Angels are present that have never come before, Allah forgives you and your mother.”<br /><br />He was forgiven before he had the chance to ask the Prophet to forgive him. He was very much attached to the Prophet after that.<br /><br />The Sahaabiyaat (radiallaahu ‘anhunna) used to send their children out in the best possible manner. They were clean and looked good.<br /><br />Umm ‘Abdillaah gave the example of Faatimah (radiallaahu ‘anhaa) bint Rasoolillah who would send out Hasan and Hussein to the Prophet in a good way. They were bathed, dressed in good clothes and perfumed.<br /><br />Umm ‘Abdillaah emphasized teaching the children the halaal (lawful) and haraam (unlawful).<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Either Hasan or Hussein saw some dates next to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and went to grab some. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stopped him to teach him the hadeeth:<br /><br />“Command the children to pray at age 7, discipline them for not praying at 10, separate the beds (encourage them to pray on a regular basis).”<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Excerpts taken from a Q/A given by Umm ‘Abdillaah al-Waadi’iyyah – Translated by Umm ‘Abdir Rahmaan Hanim</span><br /><br /><em>*Edited for clarity – Umm Hasna Firdous Bint Jabir as-Saylaani</em></div>
