<title type="html"><![CDATA[Why Is There Animosity Towards Saudi Arabia?]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=457&amp;p=486#p486"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="color: #FF0000">From the perspective of the Rawafidha and Soofiyah:</span></strong><br />The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a land which is pure of shirk and mausoleums where worship is directed at the creation.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>From the perspective of al-Ikhwaan al-muflisoon (bankrupt brother hood i.e ikhwaan al muslimeen) and the hizbiyoon:</strong></span><br />The state of Saudi Arabia governs the affairs of its people in accordance to the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. This leaves no room for the existence of political parties or any form of democratic system.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">From the perspective of the secularists:</span></strong><br />Saudi Arabia is confined to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah and therefore it prohibits women from exposing their Awrah in front of foreign men (non-mahram) or on any media outlet. This means that free mixing is not tolerated. There are no cinemas or the right to exercise freedom of speech. This is because the kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not separate religion from politics i.e the Deen of Islam is implemented in the political affairs of the country.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>From the perspective of the Jews and Christians:</strong></span><br />Saudi Arabia offers no facilities in which shirk is committed such as churches for the Christians or synagogues for the Jews.<br /><br />In summary, the animosity is derived from the fact that Saudi Arabia is a state firm upon Tawheed.<br /><br />May Allah preserve the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its people, army and the rulers.<br /><br /><img src="http://markazsunnahleicester.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG-20151009-WA0001.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Sep 21, 2016 12:49 am</p><hr />
