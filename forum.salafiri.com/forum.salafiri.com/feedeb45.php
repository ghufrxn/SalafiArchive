<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Atheism: Demonstrating The Error Of Those Who Deny The Existence Of A Creator</span></strong><br /><em>A Revealing Illustration</em><br /><br />To demonstrate the error of those who deny the existence of a Creator, one may consider the ordinary example of how a book comes into being. The existence of a book necessitates the existence of a publisher who possesses three attributes:<br /><ul>•<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Firstly</span></strong>, this publisher must possess the knowledge of the required fields of expertise for the production of this book.<br /><br />•<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Secondly</span></strong>, the publisher must possess the will to carry out such a task by consciously embarking upon this project.<br /><br />•<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Thirdly</span></strong>, the publisher must possess the ability to carry out the task of creating the pages, cover and binding of the book while finishing it with distinction.</ul><br />Once this is understood, the irrationality of claiming that a book created itself, or that it came about by mere chance, becomes apparent. Is it possible to legitimately claim that a book came about without a publisher, or that this universe came about without a Creator – solely on the basis that this publisher or Creator has not been seen?<br /><br />In actuality, understanding that a Creator exists is much easier to grasp than understanding that a simple object like a book has an originator, as the formation of our universe is far more sophisticated than the formation of any one particular object. Accordingly, the Creator stated regarding those who deny His existence:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no firm belief.”</span></strong> [52:35-36] <br /><br />These verses prove that just as it would be impossible to claim that a book was created by nothing, it would also be impossible to claim that mankind was created by nothing. Likewise, just as it would be impossible to claim that a book created itself, it would also be impossible to claim that we created ourselves. Only one other possibility exists; that mankind and everything in this universe was brought about by an All-Knowing Creator.<br /><br />It can be concluded that all things are known to come into existence by designers that possess the three attributes of <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">knowledge</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">will</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ability</span></strong> to create. No other conclusion can be drawn, except that our universe was fashioned by a Creator who possesses the knowledge, will and ability to create such an incredibly awe-inspiring formation.<br /><br />Indeed, certain pieces of evidence left behind at the scene of a crime are considered incriminating proofs that lead courts to settle cases in an absolute manner. In the same way, Allaah’s Signs within His creation and the logical evidences contained within His revelation contain even more definite proofs that we were created by an All-Knowing, All-Powerful God.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“And upon the earth are Signs visible to all who have faith with certainty, just as there are Signs within your own selves. Will you not then see?”</span></strong> [51:20,21] <br /><br /><em>Source : From the Book “Sacred Freedom” by Haneef Oliver</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://abdurrahman.org/dawah/atheism-demonstrating-the-error-of-those-who-deny-the-existence-of-a-creator.html">http://abdurrahman.org/dawah/atheism-de ... eator.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 21, 2017 9:47 pm</p><hr />

<category term="Atheism" scheme="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewforum.php?f=45" label="Atheism"/>
<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=611&amp;p=653#p653"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Big Bang Theory Repudiated!</span></span></strong><br /><br />The second theory; is the big bang theory. In summary –and I will try to clearly explain it—this theory states: The origin of creation was a simple ball comprised of a single cell. And it was tiny like the head of a pin. It was floating in time and space then it exploded fifteen billion years ago. Thus the result of this explosion was the gradual evolution of the universe. Thus the origin of this entire universe was a pinhead!<br /><br />So the question which remains as a whip to lash the backs of these atheists is:<br /><br />Where did this pinhead come from?! They have no answer for this.<br /><br />And then; why was this ball stagnant and then suddenly it decided to explode?! And what was special about this exact moment that it exploded that separate it from other moments?! How did this explosion result in astonishing order? Do explosions equate with order? How did a speck of lifelessness produce living organisms with intellects and sensibility?  The atheist will respond that reactions occurred which produced cells which formed after the explosion giving magnificent order to everything.<br /><br />If the atheist is asked: How did this forming of cells occur? And how did life appear from inanimate objects? The atheist will respond: This happens automatically, by coincidence!<br /><br />Coincidence according to the atheist in reality is the Lord of all that exist, the fashioner of the creation! This is because according to them every phenomenon is connected to it. So coincidence brought the heavens into existence and it causes the atmosphere, and the atmospheric pressure, and the gases, it causes the clouds and the land suitable for life, it causes the rivers, the oceans and the fish; it brought about mankind with bones suitable for his needs, it caused hearing and sight, it caused a heart that beats, it caused red blood cells and white blood cells with the appropriate blood cell count and above all this it caused intellect and perception. All of this according to the atheist happened by coincidence!<br /><br />Allow us to place letters in a box. Then we will shake the box with a forceful shaking, and then open it. Would anyone believe that when we opened it we will find a great passionate speech?!<br /><br />Or allow us to throw bricks behind our backs, one by one, and then when we look, we will be shocked by a beautiful home?!<br /><br />All of this happens by coincidence?! Is this sensible?!<br /><br />Reflect with me over the previous example of throwing the bricks: If we change from bricks and threw eggs—for example—would our throwing result in a house? The answer is a resounding: No.<br /><br />Thus it is a must that there is design and wisdom. Like this was the atoms of the universe; they were only joined together with wisdom. So if the atoms joined in this manner they became gold, and if the joined together in a certain manner they became water, and so on. Therefore ‘chance’ or ‘coincidence’ is not sufficient to accept what they say, rather there must be wisdom, and desire, and design.<br /><br />In contrast to this philosophy we find the Quran explains this reality is a few words.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><strong>أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بَل لَا يُوقِنُونَ</strong></span><br /><br />Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. (Soorah At Tur 52: 35-36)<br /><br />This was understood by a Bedouin Arab, and he did not hold a degree in mathematics nor did he study the theories of Nietzsche, or Lavoisier, or Darwin or other than them. Rather it was only his upright natural disposition when he said: Dung is evidence of a camel, and footsteps are evidence of a passerby, thus the heavens with its great stars, and the oceans with its waves, are they not proof of the All-Knowing the All-Powerful (Creator)?!<br /><br />But Atheism makes people from the most foolish of the creation, without exception.<br /><br />From the Upcoming Publication: Atheism: Its Causes, Dangers and ways to Confront it<br /><br /><em>By Doctor Saalih ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Uthman Sindee</em><br /><em>Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-big-bang-theory-repudiated-by-dr-shaykh-salih-sindee">http://mtws.posthaven.com/the-big-bang- ... lih-sindee</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2016 11:25 pm</p><hr />

How to Respond to the Dahrees [37]<br /><br /><strong>Question 20</strong>: We know that the Dahrees, who are many nowadays and who are considered from the intellect because they think and infer, are agreed upon the belief in the non-existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. So, how to respond to people like this?<br /><br /><em>[37] <strong>Dahrees</strong>: People who deny the existence of Allaah and claim that ad- Dahr (time) manages and disposes the affairs of the world.<br /><br />Allaah, The Most High, says concerning them:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">And they say: “There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except ad-Dahr (time). And they have no knowledge of it: they only conjecture.”</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Jaathiyah (45): 24].<br /><br />The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Allaah Said, ‘The son of Adam annoys Me for he abuses Ad-Dahr though I am Ad- Dahr (Time); in My Hands are all things, and I cause the revolution of day and night’.”</span> [Agreed upon hadeeth. Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol. 6, no.351].<br /><br />The statement “I am ad-Dahr,” means that Allaah is The One Who manages Time as explained in the hadeeth itself: <span style="color: #40BF00">“In My Hands are all things [including Time].”</span> Allaah is The One who Created everything and who disposes the affairs of everything [including Time]. It is wrong, therefore, to attribute anything to Time.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Answer</strong>: First I would like to comment on your saying that they are intellectual. So, if you mean by the intellect that of contemplation, then yes! They are intellectuals who contemplate and understand; and if you mean by that the maturity of the intellect and its following of the right way in its affairs (Rushd), then they are not intellectuals. That is why Allaah described the Kuffaar as deaf, dumb, and blind, so they have no sense. They are, however, intellectuals–having the intellect of contemplation, through which evidence is established upon them.<br /><br />In reality when they say that Allaah does not exist they say this out of arrogance, otherwise they know it is impossible that an erected door makes itself exist nor does it make itself stand upright. They know that it is inevitable that such door needed a carpenter or a blacksmith to build. It is also certain that it needed a construction worker to install. Indeed they know the food they eat and the water they drink definitely is in need of someone to produce and that the food is in need of someone to sow its seeds. They also know that it is impossible for anyone from the people to create such seed-produce, nor to make its seed grow to become a standing crop having stems and bearing fruits.<br /><br />They know all of this, and they know that this is something which humans are incapable of doing. They, however, are being arrogant, and there is no benefit in debating with an arrogant. He will never accept [the truth], no matter what it may be. If you tell him, “This is the sun” and it is right before him, he will not accept. It is a waste of time to argue with people of this kind, and, as stated by some scholars, the way to invite them is to contend with them in fight not in debates.<br /><br /><strong>Posted from Understanding Worship – Fiqh ul-‘Ibadah – QA Format – Ibn Uthaymeen – Trans by Dr Saleh as Saleh</strong><br /><br />Source: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/05/12/dahrees-deny-the-existence-of-allaah-and-claim-that-ad-dahr-time-manages-world/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2015/05/12/dahrees-deny-the-existence-of-allaah-and-claim-that-ad-dahr-time-manages-world/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 11:23 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Belief In The Existence of Allaah – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</span></span></strong><br /><br />It is the full attestation that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, exists. No one openly denied the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, except by way of haughtiness. Otherwise it is impossible for any reasonable person to claim that this creation was appeared by chance or it came into existence without a cause, due to the fact that this is something impossible to occur as agreed upon by the people of sound intellect.<br /><br />Indeed the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, is something proven by all kinds of evidences:<br /><br />(i) Rational<br />(ii) Fitriyyah [from Fitrah: Natural disposition],<br />(iii) Legal, and<br />(iv) Hissiyyah [from Hiss: What is experienced and perceived].<br /><br />All of these four evidences prove the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />As for the <strong>intellectual proof</strong>, then it is that we witness the existence of this universe and what occurs in it from things which is rather impossible for any creature to do. The existence of creation: the heavens, the earth and what is in them from the stars, mountains, rivers, trees, the speaking, the speechless, and so forth. How did this existence come into being? Did it appear by chance? Or did it occur without a cause? Or did it bring itself into existence? These are three possibilities whereby the intellect does not accept a fourth possibility. All of these possibilities are futile and false.<br /><br />As for <strong>it appearing by chance</strong>, then this is something that the intellect as well as reality itself denies, because you cannot bring such magnificent creation into existence just by chance; there must be a cause for each effect. Furthermore its astounding arrangement and harmonious order that has no conflict or collision within it, makes it impossible that it all came about randomly. This is because that which would come into existence by chance, its development would not be ordered because all of it is random and by chance.<br /><br />As for the possibility <strong>that creation brought itself into existence</strong>, then it is also clearly impossible. This is because before its existence, creation did not exist, it was nothing; and that which is nothing cannot bring into existence that which does not exist.<br /><br />As for the third possibility <strong>that this existence came to exist without a cause</strong>, then the meaning is the same as our saying that it appeared by chance; and this, as preceded, is impossible.<br /><br />It remains to be said that existence has someone who brought it into being, and He is Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. He, The Most High, Says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? (did they create themselves?) Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no certainty?</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Toor (52): 35-36].<br /><br />Hence, this creation rationally proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />As for the <strong>proof of the natural disposition</strong> for the existence of Allaah, then it is so evident that it does not require a proof. This is because man is created upon the natural disposition (Fitrah) of belief in his Rabb. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Every child is born upon the natural disposition, then his parents change him into a Jew, or a Christian, or a Majian.”</span> [35]<br /><br />That is why in case something suddenly befalls upon a person in this life such that it may destroy him, he would say with his tongue and without feeling: “O Allaah!” or “O Rabb!” or the like. This proves that the innate nature of man has been created upon the belief in the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />As for the proof of the <strong>Hiss</strong> (i.e What is experienced and perceived) for the existence of Allaah, then it is very often that we hear of supplications being answered by Allaah. Also the person himself who calls upon Allaah, his supplications are indeed responded to. Many are those who invoked Allaah and said: “O [Yaa] Rabb,” and behold! They saw response was right before his eyes! Indeed in the Qur’aan there are many examples for this, like the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">And (remember) Ayyub (Job), when he cried to his Rabb: “Verily, distress has seized me, and you are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy”. So We answered his call, and We removed the distress that was on him.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Anbiyaa’ (21): 83-84].<br /><br />In addition, there are many other examples from the Sunnah, one of which is the Hadeeth reported by Anas ibn Maalik in which he said:<br /><br />“A man [a bedouin Arab] entered the mosque on the day of Jum’ah whilst the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was delivering the Khutbah, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, property is being destroyed, and the passages have become blocked, so supplicate Allaah to send rain down upon us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and then said: ‘O Allaah send down rain upon us; O Allaah send down rain upon us.’ The sky was clear without any cloud in it. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not come down from his pulpit except that rain was flowing from his beard, may Allaah’s Salaat and Salaam be upon him. There was a downpour of rain for one week. Then on the succeeding Friday a man (the same man or someone else) entered the mosque and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the houses are collapsing and wealth is being flooded, so supplicate Allaah to stop the rain for us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and began to say: ‘around us and not upon us,’ pointing with his hands, and he did not point to any direction except that it cleared.” [36] People then stepped out walking in the sunshine.<br /><br />Many are the supplications which a person calls upon his Rabb (Allaah) to be answered are indeed responded to. This is a proof contained in what is experienced and perceived for the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br />As for the <strong>Shar’ee proof for the existence of Allaah</strong>, then it is beyond being enumerated. Indeed the Qur’aan in its entirety as well as all of the affirmed Ahaadeeth in their legal and informative nature, proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, as Allaah Says concerning the Sublime Qur’aan:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would have surely found therein much discrepancy.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 82].<br /><br />The belief in the existence of Allaah, is one of the matters that comprise(s) the belief in Allaah. As for the belief in Allaah’s Ruboobiyyah, Uloohiyyah, Names and Attributes, then a detailed discussion of these branches of Tawheed has preceded.<br /><br /><strong>References</strong><br /><br />[35] Reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=164&amp;p=169#p169"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">Secularity, reality and danger – Sheikh Farkûs</span></span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon whom Allah sent as a mercy to the Worlds, upon his Family, his Companions and his Brothers till the Day of Resurrection.<br /><br />The word “Secularity” – (Al-`Ilmâniyya) in the Arabic language – is a term that has absolutely no relation with the word “Science” (`Ilm) or its derivations. From the political point of view, secularity means “Irreligious power” (i.e. religion should not be involved in power). It is commonly defined in many Islamic books as “The separation of religion from the state”. However, this meaning is limited and does not state the reality of secularity, which involves the individual and the behavior that have no relation with the state. This is why we can express it differently in a more conformable way to the reality of secularity, which is “The establishment of an irreligious life”. Regardless the fact that secularity, whose doctrine and philosophy emerged under the protection of the western civilization, was influenced by the falsified Christianity[1] and socialism, the irreligious secularity is a worldly ideology aiming at isolating the religious influence on life. It calls to set up life on material basis in its different domains: political, economical, social, ethic, judicial and others, also on the bases of the absolute worldly knowledge, under the power of reason and experimentation, taking into consideration interest, by adapting the principle of utilitarianism over all the domains of life, in power, politics and ethics based on the Machiavellian principle “The end justifies the means”. Thus, far from the religious recommendations and prohibitions which are restricted in the individual’s mind and do not go with them beyond his personal and private relation between him and his Lord. Furthermore, he is not allowed to express himself, but only in matters of religious rituals and ceremonies, which consist of weddings, festivals, funerals and others.<br /><br />Secularity, which is based on the materialistic tendency, is soon emanated from the irreligious doctrine, whose utmost aim is fighting religion and removing it from all fields of the public life, in addition to excluding people of religion and its protectors and limiting their influence by isolating them from educational domains, institutions and scientific institutes, and preventing religious knowledge. So, its highest aim is to establish a state and a society where religion is confined to the individual level, and make people of the Islamic society feel brotherhood in state, regardless the fact that they are not brothers in religion.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the truth is not really perceived by those who divide secularity, on the one hand, into atheistic one, which radically denies the existence of the Creator and does not at all recognize something in matter of religion, and on the other hand, into non-atheistic secularity that believes, theoretically, in the Creator but rejects any relation between Allah عز وجل and the men’s life. It calls to isolate religion from the world and life, and rejects, explicitly or implicitly, the legislation of Allah. Because atheism is the nature of secularity in all its forms since atheism is to depart and to deviate from Allah’s religion and legislation including all leaning or tendency towards religion. This is what essentially leads to incredulity in Allah, the association to Him in what is illicit, transgress something forbidden by Him, and leave any of the recommendations of Allah[2].<br /><br />Besides, the origin of atheism is all what contains the association to Allah in His general Lordship, and denying Allah’s Names, attributes or Acts.<br /><br />The predication of secularity represents a huge danger to the religion of Islam and to Muslims, and the majority of the Muslims are not aware of its reality because it disguises behind different masks such as patriotism, socialism, nationalism, and others. As well as, it hides behind destructive theories like Freudianism, Darwinism, or Evolutionism[3] and others. Its partisans pretend relying on attested scientific arguments whereas they are just weak, deficient and specious arguments rejected by reason and reality:<br /><br /><strong>﴿كَمَثَلِ الْعَنكَبُوتِ اتَّخَذَتْ بَيْتًا وَإِنَّ أَوْهَنَ الْبُيُوتِ لَبَيْتُ الْعَنكَبُوتِ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ﴾ [العنكبوت: 41].<br /><br />The meaning of the verse:</strong><br /><br /><strong>﴾As the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house; and most surely the frailest of the houses is the spider’s house did they but know﴿ [Al-`Ankabût (The Spider): 41].</strong><br /><br />Especially, the one that gives the appearance of a partisan to the religion in order to confuse and to lead ordinary Muslims astray. In fact, it does not prevent the pilgrimage and prayer in the mosques. On the contrary, it contributes in their construction, it takes part in celebrations and festivals, it offers rewards and gifts for the imams and those who learn the Koran by heart, and show neither struggle nor antagonism against religion but with very fervent attempts to restrict religion in mosques and isolate it from the domains of life.<br /><br />Among the aspects and domains of secularization which are kept off from religion:<br /><br />– Politics and power, the adaptation of secularization in these fields is apparent and not hidden from the observers.<br /><br />– Secularization of teaching and its methods, a fact not refuted by those who are reasonable.<br /><br />– Secularization of economy and financial structures, clearly known by experts.<br /><br />– Civic, social and ethic laws are undoubtedly secularized.<br /><br />In fact, secularism makes of the spiritual values negative ones. In this manner, it makes the way free to the spread of atheism, westernization, libertinism and ethic anarchy. It calls for the women’s liberation according to the western style that does not condemn illegal relations between the two sexes. This is what helps to open widely the doors to shameful practices that, consequently, lead to the destruction of the family’s existence and to its disunion. Thus, with such practices, generations are formed with an irreligious education, in a society where neither an impediment or a religious barrier nor a voice of a living consciousness exist, which are substituted by agitations of worldly passions like interest, covetousness, the struggle for life, and other material hopes regardless of spiritual values.<br /><br />It is this kind of secularity that is spread in the Muslim and Arab world, through the effect of colonialism and the campaigns of Christianization and evangelization. Also, because of the improvidence of our compatriots, deluded with illusions, who brandished its slogan, and executed the plans of those who have drawn them and supported them to confuse ordinary people with specious arguments and pretensions of extreme disorientation that founded their predication, which consists of:<br /><br />– Slandering the Noble Quran and making the prophecy doubtful.<br /><br />– Pretending that the revelation is inactive and unable to adapt itself with civilisation, and Europe progressed only after getting rid of religion.<br /><br />– Pretending that Islam neglects the pursuit of the evolution of life, calls for repression, and persecutes the freedom of thought.<br /><br />– Pretending that Islamic religion has already completed its aims and remains in it only a set of rituals and spiritual practices.<br /><br />– Pretending that the Arabic language lacks or takes a long time to adapt itself with science and progress, and it is unable to pursuit civilization and development process. However, even if Arabic is the official language in Muslim countries, but still it is marginalized in the majority of administrative institutions, in universities and medical fields, especially in North African countries where the French language has replaced it and really becomes the practiced language of speaking and of communication. Nevertheless, the Arabic language has gradually regressed and loses ground according to plans already prepared and studied after knowing that Arabic is the language of the Quran and the key of the revelation sciences.<br /><br />– Pretending that the revelation has already been practically applied at the level of politics, power, and in other domains. Because, they pretend that the Islamic jurisprudence draws its prescriptions from the Roman law.<br /><br />– Pretending the harshness of the revelation in its retributions such as: lex talionis, amputation, being stoned to death, flagellation … and decide on retributions that are more appropriate by taking irreligious laws and methods from the West, by imitation, which are considered more clement and more lenient.<br /><br />Eventually, these are the set of pretensions that secularists rely on, who work in order to interrupt the revelation of Allah عز وجل by different means such as personalities, magazines, journalism, and other plans. In addition to this, they want to separate the authentic religion from the social life, and reduce it in the narrowest limits and domains according to the leanings and practices of the West who aims at breaking the commandments of Islam and releasing it from all its obligations and values. Besides, they want to alter the Muslim identity, cut them off from their religion, and lose their loyalty to it and membership to their community through the alliance to the West full of hatred, and by interchanging the values, notions, terms and authentic Islamic conceptions with western ones, in a manner that the lifestyle will be changed to that of the West, and by changing the way of thinking and acting so that it suits the thinking and deeds of the West. They also aim at changing the ethical and social behavior with the allegation that it is a modernization of the legislative, juridical and penal systems; and this in a manner that goes with the civilizational way, by imitating the western systems and legislations, all this under the banner of development and renewal.<br /><br />Many individuals of the Islamic nation were deeply influenced by secularity, and this is obvious in the fields of institutions, power, Sharia, jurisprudence and education. This influence is due to what was spread of ambiguities around Islam, its language, Quran and Prophet, as we previously mentioned.<br /><br />Many social and political institutions were influenced by these pernicious notions and proceeded to develop their countries by focusing on secularizing the state, whether under the guise of nationalism, socialism, patriotism or others. As for the other institutions with Islamic tendency, they are also influenced by secularity – save those whom Allah Has protected by His mercy – they have of religion a limited conception since they restrict it to its civilizational aspect.<br /><br />Islam, religion and state rejects categorically this duality, which consists of making a strong barrier between the material and the spiritual world; it is considered an apostasy. Moreover, Islam, within its sane and pure nature, its correct dogma and morality, does not accept the spread of the western social evils such as atheism, libertinism, ethic anarchy, and other vices, ideological and moral impurities which bring the destruction of the doctrine’s unity, the family and the society existence.<br /><br />In fact, Islam commands to Muslim to be entirely to Allah in all domains of life: his deeds, his words, and his behaviors. His life as well as his death belongs to the Allah عز وجل:<br /><br /><strong>﴿قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ * لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ﴾  [الأنعام: 162-163].<br /><br />The meaning of the verse:<br /><br />﴾Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم): “Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists) He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims﴿ [Al-An`âm (The Cattle): 162-163].</strong><br /><br />The perfect knowledge belongs to Allah. Our last prayer is all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon our Prophet صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم, his Family, his Companions and Brothers till the Day of Resurrection.<br /><br />[1] One of the Christian proclamations: Give to Caesar the power of state and to God the power of the church. Starting from this, it has emerged the principle of “The separation of religion from the state”, a principle attributed to `Issa (Jesus) عليه السلام when he said: “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” (Gospel of Luke 20:25) It is in this way that Christianity agrees with secularism. However, religion and power, in Islam, are made originally to Allah عز وجل and devoted to Him. They do neither admit the separation between religion and State, nor between religion and society, because Islam, as religion and system, is different in its origin from Christianity, which is a set of testaments, and it is also different from it when applied in the Roman societies where religion were for God and power for Caesar.<br /><br />[2] See “Adhwâ’ Al-Bayân” of Ash-Shanqîti (5/59-58).<br /><br />[3] The Darwinist theory, in reference to Charles Darwin, a British researcher, who published the book “On the origin of species” in 1859, which deals with a series of assumptions. He supported his theory of apparition and evolution which assumes that the evolution of life in organic creatures is that it evolved from a simple and primitive life to a more complex and subtle one and that it graduated from archaic to more sophisticated life. He considered that the origin of life is a cell which was in a swampy marsh some million years ago, then it had developed and had undergone many steps, among them, that of the ape which became a human. Darwin thus, considered the human as being close to the ape; he even assumed that the real ancestor of the human race is a small cell that lived in a swampy marsh. His aim by this is to eliminate the creed of the people of the truth, that the human race is descended from Adam and Eve.<br /><br />This theory caused general discomfort and a feeling of upset and perdition. Distraught and disarrayed generations who were characterized by spiritual vacuum have appeared then. Among the results of this theory, the materialistic and Marxist theory which proclaimed the materialistic aspect of the human being who is subjected to the laws of matter, thus neglecting the spiritual aspects. This theory has also an effect on the birth of Freud’s theory of psychoanalysis. Freud drew from the theory of Darwin the idea of the animality of the human being, that he is an animal guided by the sex drive; otherwise he will be in the grip of a harmful inhibition with bad effects on the nervous system.<br /><br />That is how Freud considered the evolution theory as an explication of the existence of religion by linking it to sexual urges.<br /><br />Many theories drew from the theory of Darwin destructive ideologies, as the existentialism of Sartre and the contemporary parapsychology of Bergson; they based their theories upon that of Darwin in its explication of the human race, life and behavior.<br /><br />The experimental sciences proved that Darwin’s theory is false with irrefutable proofs. His theory is not even considered a scientific theory, especially after the discoveries of Mendel’s law on inheritance and genes.<br /><br />The Quran establishes that the human being is created out of an extract of clay, then he was placed as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging (womb of a woman).<br /><br />So, the matter of creation of all creatures at the origin is water.<br /><br /><strong>﴿وَاللَهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِن مَاءٍ﴾ [النور : 45].<br /><br />The meaning of the verse:<br /><br />﴾Allâh has created every moving (living) creature from water. Of them there are some that creep on their bellies, some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allâh creates what He wills. Verily! Allâh is Able to do all things.﴿ [An-Nûr (The Light): 45].</strong><br /><br />The human stays a human, with all his constituents, his form, his characteristics and his mind, without evolution or change. This fact is a proof that the Creator is one.<br /><br /><strong>﴿الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الْإِنسَانِ مِن طِينٍ. ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلالَةٍ مِّن مَّاء مَّهِينٍ﴾  [السجدة : 7-8].<br /><br />The meaning of the verse:<br /><br />﴾Who made everything He has created good, and He began the creation of man from clay. Then He made his offspring from semen of worthless water (male and female sexual discharge).﴿ [As-Sajda (The Prostration): 7-8].</strong><br /><br />Source : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ferkous.com">http://ferkous.com</a><!-- m --> – Sheikh Abu `Abd-El-Mu`iz Muhammed `Ali Farkûs<br /><br />Translation taken from: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/05/31/secularity-reality-and-danger/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2011/05/31/secularity-reality-and-danger/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 10:49 pm</p><hr />

How many of us really know about ourselves before even thinking about the environment surrounding us? There are many great things in ourselves that we are either heedless regarding their magnificence or that we take for granted. Let us take the following journey back to the days when each one of us was an “embryo” inside the womb of his mother:<br /><br />[Who took care of me with utmost care and graciousness when I was a tiny seed settled on the wall of the uterine with three layers of darkness surrounding me?<br /><br />Who made my mother’s blood bring me food I need until I grew up to a stage in which my body was able to stand the air, the light, and the hands of people who turn me around?<br /><br />Then, when the contractions pushed me, and I was “squeezed” out and to the world of tests and trials I came out!<br /><br />Who shielded you inside as a “fertilized egg”? Then who made your residence enlarge as you grew up? Who opened the way for you when you came out naked without belongings or wealth?<br /><br />There you came so poor and needy. Two “containers” of milk hanging on your mother’s chest came to the rescue! Who commanded the milk to develop and then to stand ready for your lips to come and suck it out? A milk so agreeable to you, neither cold nor hot; neither salty nor bitter. You were so thirsty and so hungry.<br /><br />Who turned the hearing of your mother and filled it with mercy, love and attachment? The moment she hears you crying she comes forth led by her mercy and love. She would prefer to see herself in pain not you! You enlighten her life. Who put all of that in her heart?<br /><br />When your body got stronger and your belly size became bigger, you needed another kind of food. Who put in your mouth the cutting and grinding “tools”? Who held your teeth from growing during the period of your breastfeeding? It was a mercy for your mother when they were held and a mercy for you when they came out! And the stronger you became, the more you got from these “tools” of your mouth! Thereupon you used a new set of “tools”: the molars working on meat, bread and all kinds of solid food. Who provided you with these “instruments” and made them easy for you to utilize.<br /><br />When we came out we knew nothing. What a burden it would have been if we were born in a state possessing the intelligence of an adult wrapped in diapers? What kind of living it would be? Would we receive the care and kindness you normally get as developing newborns?<br /><br />Our intelligence developed gradually and we were able to slowly but surely familiarize ourselves with our surroundings. Who is the One Who is All-Wise and Most Merciful, the One Who is ever watching over us and providing us with the means we need in due proportions and exact measurements?<br /><br />Then who is the One Who fashioned our heads with hair as a beauty and protection from cold and heat? Who adorned the face of the growing man with the distinctive beauty of the beard and kept the woman’s face soft, radiant and hairless?<br /><br />Many are turning away from the one who created us and increasingly becoming heedless regarding the true objective behind our existence. They are misled by a concept and a “theory”. That is it! A “theory” that practically denies the existence of the true God (Allaah).<br /><br />Darwin [1], presented a “theory” that denies the creation of man as well as creation itself. The theory was announced in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although it is an “assumption,” there are those who consider it scientific evidence to support their arguments against the reality of creation. The theory claims that the origin of life lies in a single small animal that was “developed” on its own from water. The “environment”, according to the theory, imposed specific structural changes on this organism producing new features in it. These changes were then inherited in the offspring and further transformed with time to produce more advanced creatures of which man is the highest form. This is the theory of Darwin.<br /><br />Many critical aspects of the lives of people are still affected, knowingly or unknowingly, by some basic elements of Darwin’s theory, mainly the idea of “development” and its link to the “environment.”<br /><br /><strong>The objectives of this book are to:</strong><br /><br />A) Examine the basics of the theory and the evidence supporting them.<br />B) Provide the essential facts that disprove the validity of the theory’s assumptions.<br />C) Discuss the influence of the theory on the life of this world.<br />D) Relate man to his Creator and hence to the purpose of our creation.<br /><br />I ask Allaah (God) to enlighten the hearts of those men and women who will read this book, and to guide them to worship Him alone by submitting their wills to His will. The submission and obedience to Allaah’s Will and Commands as detailed in the last Revelation to mankind, the Qur’an, is the meaning of Islam.<br /><br />The one who is need of the Mercy of Allaah<br />Saleh As-Saleh<br />___________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF8000">From A Small Animal to Man!<br /><br />A Theory With A Broken Chain</span></strong><br />The Background and Basics of The Theory:<br /><br />(1) The theory depends on what was observed in archeological discoveries at the time of Darwin: old and new geological layers contained different remains from different forms of creation. The “old” layers contained “primitive” forms of creation while more recent layers contained more “advanced” forms. Darwin concluded that the “more advanced” creatures originated (evolved) from the “lower primitive” ones.<br /><br />(2) The theory also depends upon an idea that was prevailing at the time of Darwin in which it was thought that all animal embryos were similar at their early stages of development. This brought a conclusion that “the origin of all beings is one” and that “evolution” on earth occurred in the same way it occurred inside the wombs of living beings.<br /><br />(3) Furthermore, the theory cites “differences in the roles” of the appendix in man in comparison to that in monkey. Since it is assumed that it “does not have a role” to play in the function of the human body while it can digest plants in monkeys, the theory suggested that the appendix in man is an underdeveloped form that was a left over from monkeys.<br /><br />(4) The theory assumes the presence of a “Natural Selection” process in which there are “elimination factors” that can abolish the weak living beings while the strong ones are kept, and that their characteristics are to be inherited in their offspring. With time these characteristics will accumulate in the new beings producing new characteristics. According to Darwin, this represents the “evolutionary” process that makes of these new characteristics “higher” forms of life.<br /><br />(5) The theory suggests a “Sexual Selection” process by which there is a tendency of the male and female to mate with the strong and best members of both sexes. The characteristics of the “best” will be “inherited” and those associated with weak animals would be “eliminated” because of the lack of tendency and/or interest to mate the weak.<br /><br />(6) Whenever a new characteristic is evolved it is inherited in the offspring.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF8000">REALITY VS THEORY<br />(1) The Points about Archeology</span></strong><br /><br />The science of archeology is far from being complete and no one can claim that the search has been completed under the earth or sea layers. The door is still open for more discoveries that may contradict the theory. Assuming, however, that the findings of this science are completed, this does not establish that “higher” forms of life are developed from “lower” ones. This is only evidence for organized existence of these beings (in any form) at times when the environment is suitable for that. On the other hand, the archeological studies at the time of Darwin estimated that man’s life on earth was 600,000 years whereas new archaeological discoveries give an estimate figure of 10 Million years. This is a reflection of the incompleteness of these studies and that this science is still variable.<br /><br />It is also important to note that there are many “missing links” in the so-called “evolutionary chain” of Darwin’s theory. For example there are no archeological data to link animals of “single cells” and those of “multiple cells” nor between invertebrate animals and fish or amphibians. The same is true between amphibians and reptiles and between amphibians and birds.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">(2) The Point About Embryos</span><br /><br />This was a wrong conclusion made by some scientists because of the less sophisticated microscopy present at Darwin’s time. Today’s technology demonstrates that there are fine differences between the structure, build up and organization of animal embryos.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">(3) The Point About The Appendix</span><br /><br />The presence of this organ in man does not represent a concrete evidence for the development of man from a “monkey”. Rather its presence is inherited from the grand-man who depended upon vegetation as a source of food to help him digest it. In addition, there could be other important functions for the appendix that are not discovered yet.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">(4) The Point About Natural Selectivity</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(a) Elimination “Factors” &amp; Life “Factors”</span><br /><br />Surely there is a law and discipline that work to eliminate the living creatures, weak as well as strong. Allaah ordained death on every living being. The elimination factors are not the only factors that affect life on this planet. There are “life factors” as well, and that there is a discipline of mutual dependency and relationship between the living being and its environment. These “factors” represent the true means which Allaah has provided: sun, seas, wind, rain, plants, gravity, etc. All of these means are coordinated to provide survival for man, animals and plants. Considering the “elimination factors” alone and disregarding the “life factors” is confusion on the part of Darwin’s theory. When scientists try to formulate theories to explain certain matters in the outside world, they take into account all factors of influence.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">(b) Natural Selectivity or “Mother Nature”</span><br /><br />Surely those in support of the theory of evolution like to refer to “Mother Nature” as the “source” that provides and supports the “natural selectivity.” “Mother Nature”, however, lacks wisdom, power, self-coordination, will, and knowledge. Natural things such as wind, lightning, water, storms, warmth, severe cold, etc. can cause destruction or deformation. How could these conditions explain the beauty of the creation and its fine course of establishment and coordination? How could the minute elements in the egg of a bird “know” that the egg must appear in the form of a bird and thus it has to break its own shell to survive? The One Who had created nature provided all the means for its course of existence and activity.<br /><br />Now we see that many who arrogantly deny Allaah’s existence try to divert the attention of the people to worship this “new” deity called “Mother Nature”! In many conversations some people are reluctant to say “God” when they want to refer to “supernatural” phenomena. Instead, they say: “Mother Nature” did such and such. They like to look “normal and advanced” and not “strange and backward” in front of others. The idea of “how people will look at me,” overshadows that God (Allaah) is more important than people. It is a reflection of psychological defeat in front of secularism, which itself is the major fruit of Darwin’s theory. It is lack of true faith in the true God, Allaah. A believer in Allaah would not fear saying the Name of his Creator, the Most Merciful, and the Most Compassionate. He knows that those around him will one day die, but Allaah is the Everliving. So, who must count first? He knows that Allaah is the Sustainer and Provider and not the “Chairman of the Boards” nor the “Chief Executives,” managers, or any other boss! This is the benefit of worship of Allaah: A liberation from slavery to anything and (or) anyone but Allaah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">(c) “Mother Nature” Is Not The “Creator”</span><br /><br />A simple comparison between man and nature illustrates that man can see, hear, know, learn, reason, etc. whereas nature has none of these qualities. How could man then be “more advanced” than a “creator” known as “Mother Nature?” This proves the falsehood of the idea of god-Mother Nature. Allaah says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم [2] to mankind): How do you worship besides Allaah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allaah, Who is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.” </span>(Qur’an 5:76).<br /><br />In many aspects, nature is under man’s service, and its resource is under his disposal, as Allaah had decreed in the Final Revelation to mankind, the Qur’an:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has perfected His graces upon you (both) apparent [3] and hidden [4]? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light.”</span> (Qur’an 31: 20).<br /><br />With the progress of technology some people became even more arrogant. Not only do they refer to “Mother Nature” as the “founder or creator,” but aim to control nature itself. It is a strange conclusion! Allaah has made it very clear that there will be this type of people:<br /><br />“The likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it. Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect.” (Qur’an 10: 24).<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">(d) The “Laws” of Nature</span><br /><br />Some consider that “Nature” represents the “Laws” that govern the universe. They try to explain how things occur, but do not answer questions like: Who created this universe? Who put the “Laws” into effect? This leaves them separated by an artificial barrier into two “personalities”: one that best “fit” the society (i.e. the outside) and tries to give “interpretations” for what occurs in the universe; and one kept within themselves confessing that God (Allaah) is the One commanding these “supernatural” phenomena. But under dangerous circumstances, you hear them calling: “Oh my God!” or “God help me!”<br /><br />In the old ages, man knew that rain came down from the sky. Today we know a lot about this process, from the evaporation of water up to the formation of raindrops, there is a reflection of real actions. In their references, scientists do not tell us how did these realities become laws. For example: why are these laws coordinated in ways allowing birds to fly in the air, fishes to live in the water, and man to live on the earth? “Nature’s” qualities are not its own. It has been given the attributes we feel and see around us.<br /><br />The true Creating Power has all the Perfect Attributes and All-Perfect Actions. He is Allaah:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: “(It is) Allaah.” Say: “Have you then taken (for worship) Auliyâ’ (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?” Say: “Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.” Say: “Allâh is the Creator of all things; He is the One, the Irresistible.”The One Who has created (everything), and fashioned it in due order and proportion; Who has measured and granted guidance.</span> (Qur’aan 87: 2-3)<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“The One who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creation of the One (Allaah) Whose Mercy encompasses everything. Then look again: “Can you see any rifts?” “Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out.”</span> (Qur’an 67: 3-4).<br /><br />“Allaah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see. Then He ascended the ‘Arsh (the Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round)! Each running (its course) for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Rabb. (Qur’an 13: 2).<br /><br />“He has created the heavens without any pillars, that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it shake with you. And He has scattered therein animals of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind you grow therein.” (Qur’an 31: 10).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And indeed We [5] created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us [6].”</span> (Qur’an 50: 38).<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">(e) A God Other Than Allaah!?</span><br /><br />In an Address to man, Allaah sends clear and vivid verifications as well as challenges for man and for these “gods” that some invoke and worship:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.”</span> (Qur’an 27: 61).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky whereby We cause to grow gardens full of beauty and delight. It is not in your power to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”</span> (Qur’an 27: 60).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (Rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah from all that they ascribe as partner (to Him)!”</span> (Qur’an 27: 63).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who originates creation, then repeats it, and Who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say, “Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur’an 27: 64).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Say (to the disbelievers): “Tell me, if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is there-an “ilah” (a god) other than Allaah could restore them to you? Look, how variously We explain the Signs, yet they turn aside.”</span> (Qur’an 6: 46).<br /><br />Many in this world have turned to worship many created things or beings. Divine attributes has been given to Buddha, ‘Eesa (Jesus), Saints, Monks, Musa (Moses), Prophets, Places, Rivers, Cows, Temples, etc., Do these “gods” benefit or harm?<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And they worship besides Allaah things that hurt them not, nor profit them and they say: “These are our intercessors with Allaah.” Say: “Do you indeed inform Allaah with that which He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Far is He removed from every imperfection! And far is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!”</span> (Qur’an 10: 18).<br /><br /><strong>Where did they find “Names” for them?</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</span> (Qur’an 12: 40).<br /><br /><strong>Where are the things they have created?</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“This is the creation of Allaah. So show me that which those (whom you worship) beside Him have created. Nay but the wrong-doers (and those who do not submit to Allaah) are in plain error.”</span> (Qur’an 31: 11).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Tell me or inform me (what) do you think about your (so-called) partner-gods to whom you call upon besides Allaah, show me, what they have created of the earth? Or have they any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book, so that they act on clear proof therefrom?’ Nay, the wrong-doers (and those who do not believe in Allaah) promise one another nothing but delusions.”</span> (Qur’an 35: 40).<br /><br /><strong>In fact they are unable to create even a fly:</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Verily! Those on whom you call besides Allaah, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.”</span> (Qur’an 22: 73).<br /><br /><strong>They themselves are created, aren’t they?</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Attribute they as partners to Allaah those who created nothing? But they themselves are created.”</span> (Qur’an 7: 191).<br /><br /><strong>They cannot even help themselves!</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</span> (Qur’an 7: 192).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Have you then taken (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as no power either for benef) it or for harm to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal with the one who sees? Or darkness equal with light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.’ Say: Allaah is the Creator of All things. He is the One, the Irresistible.”</span> (Qur’an 13: 16).<br /><br /><strong>They cannot answer those who invoke upon them!</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur’an 7: 194).<br /><br />The above proofs are sent down from Allaah to bring people to their senses. This is a Mercy and Kindness from Allaah for mankind. He said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Allaah Is the One Who sends down manifest Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, Allaah is to you Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.”</span> (Qur’an 57: 9).<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">(6) The Point About “Sexual Selection”</span><br /><br />The survival of the strongest is not evidence for selective developmental evolution. The only thing that can be understood about the mating tendencies is that they will maintain continuity in the same strong kind and an end to the weak kind. Thus:<br /><br />(i) The muscles of a strong athlete will not be inherited in his offspring.<br />(ii) The mind of a high quality scholar will not be transferred to his children by inheritance.<br /><br />The saying that newly acquired characteristics can be inherited is rejected by modern genetic studies as well as known facts. Any quality that is not an intrinsic part of the genome is “temporal” and is not transmitted to the offspring by inheritance: Muslims circumcise their babies.<br /><br />Their children are not born circumcised!<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">(7) “Under-developed Theory”</span><br /><br />We have not seen (or heard about) certain types of animals coming to existence through the process of developmental transformation. There was no monkey transformed into a man even after hundred years or so!<br /><br />The nose of a dog is more sensitive in its smelling function than that of man. Is the nose of the dog more “advanced” than that of man? Or are the birds (with flying abilities) and frogs (with amphibian abilities) more “developed” than man? The eye of the camel and that of the horse or donkey can see during day and night, is it true then that these animals represent more “advanced” forms than man?<br /><br />The male man, like the male elephant, has breast marks while horses and male donkeys do not (except some resemblance to whatever their respective mothers were). So, why does the male man continue to possess this feature while it was not present in some “lower” beings?<br /><br />Scientists have called Darwin’s study a “Theory” and clearly there is always a difference between theory and reality. A theory by definition is falsifiable.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES</span></strong></span><br />The idea of “selection for the strong” had a tremendous influence on humanity. It made it easy for some strong men and strong nations to think and feel that they are strong and superior because of an “evolutionary selective process.” They feel that they are entitled to certain practices of domination according to the idea “survival is for the best!” This is well manifested in the colonial expansions, racism, and in many practices by many of the so-called “democratic nations” who practice the principle of supremacy: “Might is Right.” The idea of “development” interprets life as a “constant struggle between living beings and that the survival is only for the one that best fits the environment around it.”<br /><br />In reality this environment is a materialistic one and it dictates the type of development, its size, and its direction in an imposed way leaving no role for the living being. This idea is very well used in our times to support the materialistic life of the modern world.<br /><br />Materialism is imposed in a way as an integral part for “development.” In the name of “development” today’s “secondary” things for your home are becoming the “necessary” items of tomorrow and if you don’t buy them you are going to “look different,” “rejected” and a “drop out” because you do not “fit” the environment around you. Just look around and see the many thousands of things that were “secondary” a year ago and became “essential” a year later! Open a woman’s dresser today and see the latest “fashion” dresses and shoes. Come next month and you find “new” ones. She has to “fit” into the “environment” around her. Men are also influenced with this “fit the environment” concept. Who is doing this to the World? Many are those who contribute to this problem. They come from “big businesses”, media sectors, politicians, military establishments, academia, ‘the world of fashions’, etc.<br /><br />In the name of progress, many people are influenced by the materialistic environment and are driven away from Allaah, their Creator. On the other hand, many are discovering the truth regarding the very essence of the purpose of existence. They are finding true, satisfactory and beneficial life in the code of life which their Creator has described in the final revelation to man: the Noble Qur’an. They came to know the beauty and reality of the following verse:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Say: (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): “Truly, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Rabb [the Creator, the Owner, and the One Who Commands and Administers everything] of the ‘Aalameen [all that exists].”</span> (Qur’an 6: 162).<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">Why Did The “Theory” Spread?</span><br />The theory came at a critical moment in the conflict between the church and many of its corrupted doctrines on one hand and the secular sector (especially scientists) in the 19th century Europe, on the other hand. During this conflict many scientists were killed and/or persecuted. This theory was one of the weapons that were raised by the scientists in their fight with the religious authorities in and outside Europe. It was presented as “The Scientific” reference of the mind. It was introduced in the education programs of most of the colonized countries as “Scientific Knowledge” to support its acceptance. Many colonized Muslim countries were targeted and this caused a great deal of negative influence on many generations, especially with the victory of the secular-scientific thoughts in Europe over the church-made laws. This played a role in the spread of secular thoughts in many parts of the world. For many it helped promote a stand against church oppression, and when it served its purpose it was transformed to serve the purpose of influence and secularism.<br /><br />Most people had no idea about the theory itself and/or the its concept of “selectivity” that was used as a “pretext of justification” for colonization, reflecting the prejudice of “being better” than those “weak ones” from the “other” world communities.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF8000">THE QUR’AN AND THE “THEORY”</span><br />When Allaah, the Most High, tells us about any matter, it comes from the One Who is All-Knowing. Whatever man knows is nothing compared to what Allaah, the Exalted, Knows:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Allaah knows and you know not.”</span> (Qur’an 2: 216).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Should He not Know, what He created? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).”</span> (Qur’an 67: 14)<br /><br />Why do people question their origin when they did not witness its creation? This is result of secular reasoning. Without the reality of creation, there is no purpose for man’s existence:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“I called them not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation.”</span> (Qur’an 18: 51).<br /><br />Whatever Allaah decrees in relevance to man’s creation is different from “theories”! Allaah, the AllKnowing, tells us that He informed the Angels about the creation of Adam before it happened:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And (remember) when your Rabb said to the angels: Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.”</span> (Qur’an 2: 30).<br /><br />And He, Most High, told us about the kind of material from which Adam was created: dust and water, and the offspring of Adam from sperm:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust (i.e. Adam) then from a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharges i.e. offspring of Adam) then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed (miscarriage) that We may make (it) clear for you (to show our Power and Ability to do what We will). And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then we bring you out as infants [7], then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known.”</span> (Qur’an 22: 5).<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“He is the One Who has created you from clay and then decreed a stated term (for you to die).”</span> (Qur’an 6: 2).<br /><br />Allaah shaped Adam by His own Hands [8]:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Allaah said:”O! Iblees (Devil) what prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with both My Hands.”</span> (Qur’an 38: 75).<br /><br />The Prophet (Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم) also informed us that:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“When Allaah created Adam from a Handful from all of the earth (material), the children of Adam came just like the earth: amongst them the red, the white and the black and those who are in between; the easy and the sad; the evil ones and the good ones.”</span> [9]<br /><br />Allaah then changed this clay into “sounding clay:”<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“He created man (Adam) from a sounding clay like the clay of pottery.”</span> (Qur’an 55: 14).<br /><br />Allaah, the Exalted and Magnificent, breathed into this clay a created and honored soul and life came into Adam and he became Adam that can hear, see, talk and think:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“So, when I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him his soul created by Me, then you (angels) fall down prostrating to him.”</span> (Qur’an 15: 29).<br /><br />Right after Adam’s creation he started to speak:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And He taught Adam the names (of everything); then He showed them to the angels and said ‘Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.’ They (angels) said: ‘Far is You (Allaah) removed from every imperfection, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the AllKnower, the All-Wise. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names…”</span> (Qur’an 2: 31-32).<br /><br />Even the first woman was created from the first man, Adam:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb, Who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from him (Adam) He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women..”</span> (Qur’an 4: 1).<br /><br />After the creation of Adam, Allaah commanded angels to prostrate to Adam; all of them obeyed. This is a great Honor to Adam. Iblees (the Devil) refused out of arrogance:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate to Adam.” So they prostrated except Iblees (the Devil). He was of the Jinns10; he disobeyed the Command of His Rabb.”</span> (Qur’an 18: 50).<br /><br />Allaah expelled him from His Mercy, and warned Adam against him:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrong-doers (and polytheists).”</span> (Qur’an 18: 50).<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF8000">THE TEST</span></span></strong><br />Both Adam and his wife were tested in Paradise. They were allowed to eat from all the fruits of Paradise. They were ordered, however, to stay away from a particular tree:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the wrong-doers.”</span> (Qur’an 2: 35).<br /><br />They disobeyed Allaah by eating from it and Allaah sent them down to earth to live with their posterity, that He may test their obedience and submission to Him. Certainly they repented and Allaah, Oftforgiving, accepted their repentance. The status of the children of Adam is above that of monkeys or lizards:<br /><br /><span style="color: #40BF00">“And indeed We have honored the children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea and have provided them with At-Tayyibat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preference.”</span> (Qur’an 17: 70).<br /><br />This is the true origin of man: an honored being above that of a cockroach or a mouse! The response of man must be that of thanks to his Creator, Allaah, manifesting itself in true submission and obedience to Him. This is the meaning of Islam. It is the religion of man since Adam, peace be upon him and it is the same religion of Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) peace be upon them all. It is manifested in its final, completed, and preserved form in the Qur’an that was revealed to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. It calls man to dissociate himself from any form of worship to other than his Creator, Allaah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #800000"><em>Completed on Friday, the 10th of the 11th Islamic month of Thul Qi’dah, corresponding to the 2nd of January 2004.<br /><br />Final revision on Saturday 1-5-1425 Hj, corresponding to the 19th June 19, 2004.<br /><br />May Allaah reward sister Umm Ahmad (Canada) for her suggestions and editing.

It reads: Sallaa Allaahu ‘Aleihi Wasallam, which means: May Allaah Praise his mention and safeguard him from every imperfection and from all kinds of evil.”<br /><br />[3] i.e. Islamic Monotheism, the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.<br /><br />[4] i.e. One’s faith in Allaah, knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise, etc.<br /><br />[5]The “We” refers to Allaah Himself. It is common with Semitic languages for any monarch to use the “We” and “Us” when referring to himself. And to Allaah belongs the best example. He Glorifies Himself as suits His Majesty. When Allaah says: “We” or “Us,” no one who is familiar with the Arabic lexicology understands that this refers to “more than one God united in one!” Allaah is One and Unique and all of His Attributes describe His Essence, not qualities of separate “gods”! He is the Most Merciful, the Provider, the Creator, the Oft-Forgiving, the Originator, etc.<br /><br />[6] The authenticity of the contents of any book, which describes Allaah with imperfect Attributes, is questionable. Allaah acts, originates, creates, and does what He wants such that neither tiredness nor slumber or sleep overtakes Him:<br /><br />Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. (Qur’an 2:255)<br /><br />[7] Prophet Muhammad, may Allaah exalt his mention and render him safe from every imperfection, said: “(As regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allaah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into his body…”(Collected in Saheeh Al-Bukhari which contains the most authentic traditions of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (vol. 4, hadeeth # 549). The texts are published by Dar-Arabia (Beirut, Lebanon) in English and Arabic. This narration came from Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who was un-lettered. These early stages of growth of the human body were known only approx.1400 years after the Prophet’s explanation. These statements, together with other prophecies by the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is a testimony that a) he was a true messenger of Allaah and b) the Qur’an he was trusted with is a true Revelation from Allaah. Those searching for the truth can find in the Qur’an their objective if they are sincere in their strive.<br /><br />[8] All of the Attributes of Allaah are real and true. He informed us about Himself and about His Attributes. He speaks only the truth. In all of His Attributes He is perfect and distinct from His creation:<br /><br />“And nothing is like unto Him. He is the All-Hearer AllSeer.” ( Qur’an 42: 11).<br /><br />[9] Related by the scholars of Hadeeth: Al-Tirmithee and Abu Dawood and Al-Hakim.<br /><br />[10] Jinns are beings created with free will, living on earth in a world parallel to that of man, and are invisible to human eyes in their normal state. The term “Jinnee” (English: Genie) is equivalent to Jinn, and Jaann may be used as its plural or as another singular form. In Islamic literature, Shaytaan (English: Satan, Devil) is a name given to disbelieving Jinns. Amongst them are the believers and non-believers.<br /><br />Source: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/08/02/creation-versus-evolution-darwins-theory/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2016/08/02/creation-versus-evolution-darwins-theory/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 10:45 pm</p><hr />
