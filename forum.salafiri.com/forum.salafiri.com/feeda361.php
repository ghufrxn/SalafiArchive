<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Virtues of Various Chapters of the Qur’an</span></span></strong><br /><br />Here are some ahadith regarding the virtues of various chapters of the Qur’an, collected from some of the books of Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have Mercy upon him):<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1 - ‘al-Fatihah’:</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn ‘Abbas narrated:<br /><br />“While Jibril was with the Messenger of Allah, he heard a noise from above. Jibril lifted his sight to the sky and said: “This is a door in the Heavens being opened, and it has never been opened before now.” An Angel descended from that door and came to the Prophet and said: “Receive the glad tidings of two lights that you have been given, which no other Prophet before you was given: the Opening of the Book, and the last ayaat of ‘al-Baqarah.’ You will not read a letter of them except that you will gain its benefit.””<br /><br />[‘Sahih at-Targhib wat-Tarhib’; # 1456]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 - ‘al-Baqarah’:</span></strong><br /><br />“Whoever recites Ayat al-Kursi (ayah # 255) after every obligatory prayer, then there is nothing between him and his entrance into Paradise except his death.”<br /><br />[‘Sahih al-Jami”; # 6464]<br /><br />“Verily, Allah Wrote a Book one thousand years before He Created the Heavens and the Earth; from this Book descended the last two ayaat of ‘al-Baqarah.’ These ayaat are not recited for three nights in any home except that no devil can come near it.”<br /><br />[‘Sahih al-Jami”; # 1799]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3 – ‘az-Zumar’ and ‘al-Isra”:</span></strong><br /><br />‘A’ishah said:<br /><br />“The Prophet would never sleep until he had recited ‘az-Zumar’ and‘Bani Isra’il’ (i.e., ‘al-Isra”).”<br /><br />[‘as-Silsilah as-Sahihah’; # 641]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4 – The Glorifiers:</span></strong><br /><br />al-‘Irbad bin Sariyah said:<br /><br />“The Prophet would not sleep until he had recited ‘al-Musabbahat’ *(the Glorifiers), and he would say:“In them is a ayah that is better than a thousand ayaat.”“<br /><br />[‘Sahih at-Tirmidhi’; # 2712]<br /><br />*: ‘al-Musabbahat’ are those chapters that begin with “سبح” or “يسبح” and they are: ‘al-Isra’,’ ‘al-Hadid,’ ‘al-Hashr,’ ‘as-Saff,’ ‘al-Jumu’ah,’ ‘at-Taghabun,’ and ‘al-A’la.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5 – ‘al-Kahf’:</span></strong><br /><br />“Whoever memorizes the first ten ayaat of ‘al-Kahf,’ then he will be protected from the trial of the Dajjal.”<br /><br />[‘as-Silsilah as-Sahihah’; # 582]<br /><br />“Whoever recites ‘al-Kahf’ as it was revealed, he will have a light on the Day of Resurrection that will reach from wherever he is all the way to Makkah. And whoever recites the last ten ayaat of it, and the Dajjal emerges right after, then he will not be harmed by him. And nobody makes ablution, then says: ‘Glory and praise be to You, O Allah. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn to You in repentance’ [Subhanak Allahumma wa bi Hamdik; ashhadu an la ilaha illa Ant. Astaghfiruk wa atubu ilayk] except that it is written on a tablet and permanently transcribed on that tablet, and that tablet will not be broken or damaged until the Day of Resurrection.”<br /><br />[‘as-Silsilah as-Sahihah’; # 2651]<br /><br />“Whoever recites ‘al-Kahf’ on the night before Friday, then a light will be lit for him between wherever he is and the Ka’bah.”<br /><br />[‘Sahih at-Targhib wat-Tarhib’; # 736]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6 – ‘al-Mulk’:</span></strong><br /><br />“There is a chapter in the Qur’an that is made up of thirty ayaat. It interceded for a man until he was forgiven all of his sins, and that chapter is ‘Tabarak.’“<br /><br />[‘Sahih at-Tirmidhi’; # 2315]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7 – ‘al-Ikhlas’:</span></strong><br /><br />“Whoever recites ‘Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad’ and completes it ten times, Allah will build a palace for him in Paradise.”<br /><br />[‘as-Silsilah as-Sahihah’; # 589]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/08/14/virtues-of-various-chapters-of-the-quran/">http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/08/14/vir ... the-quran/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Nov 06, 2016 11:12 pm</p><hr />
