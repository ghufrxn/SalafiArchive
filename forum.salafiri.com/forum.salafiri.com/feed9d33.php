So once the salafee has safeguarded himself by adhereing to the above principle in, refuting the innovator and innovation, it is upon him then that he further distinguish and safeguard himself from the innovator and a means of doing this is that he does not have the ahl ul bidah as his companion.<br /><br />This principle and the one above are connected and understand it well may Allah have mercy on you, that, “every time a salafee has a companion from the people of innovation it is usually at this tage that he will open his heart to the innovator, not being able to rebuke him or his innovation”. So for this reason we find the tremendous saying of Abu Dardaa who said,<br /><br />“It is from the fiqh (understanding of a person) that he [chooses] those whom he walks with, whom he enters upon (visits) and whom he sits with.” (al-Ibaanah 2/477)<br /><br />And Yahyaa bin Katheer said,<br /><br />“Sulaimaan bin Daawood alaihis salaam said: Do no pass a judgement over anyone with anything until you see whom he befriends.” (al-Ibaanah 2/464)<br /><br />And Moosaa bin Uqbah, the Syrian, approached Baghdaad and this was mentioned to Imaam Ahmad. So it was said,<br /><br />“Look at whose residence he goes to and with whom he resides and finds shelter.” (al-Ibaanah 2/480)<br /><br />And Imaam Al-Awzaaee said,<br /><br />“Whoever hides his innovation from us will not be able to hide his companionship from us.” (al-Ibaanah 2/476)<br /><br />May Allah have mercy on you, look at those who were far noble, upright and god fearing than you and I, yet they had a strong stance to those who corrupted the deen and not having any links with them.<br /><br />So we ask, which one today is more knowledgeable in aqeedah and manhaj concerning how to deal with the ahl ul bidah and the principles of al jarh wa tadeel than Al Awzaaee? Yet ponder on the noble saying of al-Awzaaee.<br /><br />Bring forth your men if you are truthful! So do not be Oh Salafee like the one who deludes himself thinking that the Ahlul Bidah will not affect him as his companion but know that the effect of this companionship will be so severe upon you that you will not be able to hide it! Allahs protection is sought.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not-drink-o-salafi-from-the-well-in-which-their-is-impurity/">http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not ... -impurity/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:59 am</p><hr />
