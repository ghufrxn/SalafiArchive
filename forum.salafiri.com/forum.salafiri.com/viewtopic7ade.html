an-Nabula 14/438)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(40) Imaam Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Alee bin Abdullah bin Muhammad as-Sooree (d.441H)</span><br />He was the Famous Imaam of Baghdaad he said, “Say to those who hate the Hadeeth and its People and speak ill of them what are you saying to knowledge, if it is from ignorance then being ignorant is from the stupid ones. Do you speak ill of those who saved the religion from baseless and futile things.”<br />(Tadhkirratul-Huffadh 3/1117 no.1002 sound chain, (Siyaar A’laam an-Nabula 14/438), al-Muntadham 15/324 of Ibn al-Jawzee)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(41) Imaam Suyootee (d.911H)</span><br />He said in explanation of the verse. “And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam (Sooralal-Israa 17:71) “There is no better virtue for the Ahlul Hadeeth than that because there is no other Imaam for the Ahlul Hadeeth other than the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)”<br />(Tadreeb ur-Raawee 2/126)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(42) Imaam Ismaaeel bin Muhammad bin Fadhal al-Asbaahanee (d.535H)</span><br />He said, “Mention the Ahlul Hadeeth as they are the group upon the truth until the hour is established.”<br />(al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah Wa Sharh Aqeedah Ahlus Sunnah 1/246)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(43) Qaadhee Hasan bin Abdur Rahmaan bin Khalaad Raamehrmuzee (d.360H)</span><br />He said, “Allaah has given virtue to the Hadeeth and his blessing to the Ahlul-Hadeeth.”<br />(al-Muhaddith al-Faasil Bayna ar-Raawee wal-Wa’awee pg.159 no.1)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(44) Hafs bin Ghiyath (d.194H)</span><br />He was asked concerning the people of Hadeeth ie the Ashaabul Hadeeth he replied, “They are the best (ie good) from the people of this world”<br />(Ma’arifah Uloom al-Hadeeth pg.3 no.3 of Imaam Haakim and its chain is authentic)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(45) Abul Fath Nasr bin Ibraaheem al-Maqdisee (d.490H)</span><br />He said, “Chapter: The virtue of Ahlul Hadeeth”<br />(al-Hujjah A’la Tareeq al-Muhajjah 1/325)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(46) Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Muflih al-Maqdisee (d.763H)</span><br />He said, “The Ahlul Hadeeth are the saved group who are established upon the truth”<br />(al-Adaab ash-Sharee’ah 1/211)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(47) Muhammad bin Ismaa’eel al-Ameer al-Yamaanee (d.840H)</span><br />He said, “upon you (ie to stick) to the virtuous of Ashaabul-Hadeeth (people of Hadeeth) you will find with them all guidance and virtues.”<br />(ar-Raudh al-Baasim Fe Dhab Ann Sunnah Abil-Qaasim 1/146)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(48) Haafidh Ibn as-Salaah d.806H)</span><br />After mentioning the conditions for an authentic hadeeth he said, “This is the hadeeth which is graded to be authentic without any differing amongst the Ahlul Hadeeth.”<br />(Uloom al-Hadeeth well known as Muqaddimah Ibn as-Salaah with Sharh of al-A’raqee pg.20)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(49) Abu Ismaa’eel Abdur Rahmaan bin Ismaa’eel as-Saboonee (d.449H)</span><br />He wrote a book titled, ‘Aqeedatus-Salaf Wa Ashaabul Hadeeth’ in it he says, “The Ahlul Hadeeth have the Aqeedah, they testify Allaah The Glorious is above the seven heavens upon his Throne.”<br />(Aqeedatus-Salaf Ashaabul-Hadeeth pg.14)<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">(50) Abu Mansoor Abdul Qaahir bin Taahir bin Muhammad al-Baghdaadee (d.429H)</span><br />He said concerning the people of Shaam, “All of them are upon the Madhab of Ahlul Hadeeth from Ahlus-Sunnah”<br />(Usool ud deen pg.317)<br /><br />So from these 50 statements we have proved the attributive name of the Muslims is Ahlul Hadeeth as it was for the Muhaajireen, the Ansaar and Ahlus-Sunnah and there is Ijmaa on this permissibility on the usage of this title. Not a single Imaam said it is incorrect to use the term of Ahlul Hadeeth, nor said it is impermissible or said it is an innovation however some Khawaarij and those who sympathise with them hate the title of Ahlul Hadeeth, they say it is an innovation and say it is a sectarian name and make fun of it and by doing so they oppose the ijmaa (consensus) of all of the scholars of hadeeth and the Muslims.<br /><br />There are many more statements which show evidence for the attributive name of Ahlul Hadeeth or the People of Hadeeth. We also find from the clarifications from the scholars of hadeeth and ijmaa that the title of Ahlul Hadeeth is of scholars of Hadeeth and the general Muslims who have sound Aqeedah who act upon the understanding of the Book and Sunnah without taqleed based on the understanding of the Salaf us-Saaliheen and their beliefs are also in conformation with the Quraan, Sunnah and Ijmaa. Remember Ahlul Hadeeth and Ahlus-Sunnah are names of the one and same group.<br /><br />Some people of innovation say the Ahlul Hadeeth only refers to the Scholars of Hadeeth whether these scholars are from Ahlus-Sunnah or people of innovation so we say their statement is rejected on the basis of it being contrary to the understanding of the Salaf us-Saaliheen. By accepting this statement of the people of Innovation it necessitates misguided people are also part of the victorious group so this statement being futile and is also apparent to the general people. The Scholars of Hadeeth have themselves clearly said about certain narrators not being from the Ahlul Hadeeth. (refer to statements no’s. 5, 21 and 28). Every innovator in this world hates and has animosity for the Ahlul Hadeeth so does this now mean that every innovator hates himself (because they are included within the victorious group). The truth is only two groups of people are worthy of this attributive title of Ahlul Hadeeth<br /><br />(1) The people of report hadeeth (ie the scholars of hadeeth)<br />(2) The people who act upon the hadeeth (ie the scholars of hadeeth and the general people)<br /><br />Haafidh Ibn Taymiyyah said, “We do not take the meaning of Ahlul Hadeeth to just mean the people who heard (ahadeeth), wrote them and or conveyed (or narrated them) rather we take the meaning it refers to the one who preserves, knows/learns and understands them inwardly and outwardly and follows them inwardly and outwardly and this is the same for the people of the Quraan” (Majmoo’a Fataawa 4/95) of Ibn Taymiyyah<br /><br />So we find from this clarification of Haafidh Ibn Taymiyyah Ahlul Hadeeth refers to the scholars of hadeeth and the general people. Lastly I would like to add Ahlul Hadeeth is not family based group rather it is an ideology. Anyone who is Ahlul Hadeeth and acts on the Quraan, Sunnah and Ijmaa upon the understanding of the Salaf us-Saaliheen and has belief in this then by calling himself Ahlul Hadeeth or Ahlus Sunnah it does not mean he will enter Paradise especially if he abandons righteous actions and follows his desires. The one who will be saved is the one who respects the Salaf and lives his life based on the Quraan and Sunnah and a label alone will not suffice. Salvation is achieved by purifying the heart and soul, rectifying ones Eemaan and Aqeedah and doing righteous actions and only then he will be the saved. InshaAllaah.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/">http://www.Ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com</a><!-- m --></div>
