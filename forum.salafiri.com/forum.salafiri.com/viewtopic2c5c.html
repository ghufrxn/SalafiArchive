When his body was brought forward after one of the obligatory prayers to be prayed over, the Imaam, who was one of the students of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, asked, ‘Who is the deceased?’ They said, ‘So and so.’ He said, ‘The one who spoke ill of Shaikh Ibn Baaz and swore at him? By Allaah, I won’t pray over him!’<br /><br />We prayed over him along with the people. [Afterwards] some people were saying that this Imaam who didn’t pray over that man will have a high and privileged standing in the eyes of Shaikh ’Abdul-’Aziz.<br /><br />When the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, came back from Hajj, they told him that that man had passed away, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">so he asked for Allaah’s mercy for him</span></strong>. Then they told him that the Imaam didn’t pray over him—<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">and the Shaikh became angry, visibly so, and he wasn’t pleased [at all]</span></strong>. Then he told someone, either ’Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jallaal or someone else, to take him to the graveyard,<strong><span style="color: #0000FF"> and [when he got there] he stood at the grave of that man and prayed and supplicated for him.”</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz, Duroos wa Mawaaqif wa ’Ibar, p. 67.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13/take-heed-and-use-your-brain-this-is-how-its-done-the-man-who-abused-and-cursed-ibn-baaz-and-who-then-passed-away-the-gentleness-mercy-and-understanding-of-ibn-baaz/">https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13 ... -ibn-baaz/</a><!-- m --></div>
