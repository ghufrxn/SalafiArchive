<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Is Al-Khidr, upon Him be peace, still alive now?</span></span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.miraathpublications.net/">http://www.miraathpublications.net/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong>By: Shaykh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (Rahimahullah)</strong><br /><br />The people differed regarding Khidr. Is he still around even up to this time wherein we live and he has not died, or has he died? That which is correct is that which the texts indicate; that he has died. This is because Allaah has said:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span><br /><br />Everyone shall taste death. (Aali Imran 3:185)<br /><br />The proofs and evidences indicate that he is not alive. For if her were alive then the day that Muhammad ﷺ was sent he would have hastened to follow him and act by his Sharee’ah. However, he had died a number of centuries before that; for Allaah took a covenant from the Messengers and Prophets that if He sent Muhammad while they were still alive then they would follow him. As Allaah, Mighty be He, has said:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللّهُ مِيثَاقَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَا آتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَاءكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ</span><br /><br />And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: “Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah, etc.), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.” (Aali Imran 3:81)<br /><br />From the proofs as well is that which has come on the authority of ‘Abdullaah that he said: The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ led us in the `Ishaa’ prayer and that is the one called Al-`Atma by the people. After the completion of the prayer, he faced us and said, “Do you know the importance of this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight will be living after one hundred years from this night.”[1]<br /><br />Translated By: Raha ibn Donald Batts<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Taken from: A Gift to the Reader in Explanation of the Book of Knowledge from Saheeh al-Bukhaaree pg. 95</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Al-Bukhaaree reported it in the Book of the Times of Prayer; Chapter: Mentioning the ‘Ishaa prayer and Al-‘Atmah, and whoever sees them to be one and the same, no. 539<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Sep 11, 2016 11:18 pm</p><hr />
