<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Take Heed and Use Your Brain, This is How It’s Done: The Man who Abused and Cursed Ibn Baaz and who then Passed Away—The Gentleness, Mercy, and Understanding of Ibn Baaz</span></strong><br /><br />“An example of the soundness of the Shaikh’s heart can be seen in what Shaikh ’Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jallaal narrated to me, may Allaah reward him, where he said that Shaikh Ibn Baaz ruled against a man in a certain issue and the man became upset and he was someone who had a sharp tongue and he started to insult the Shaikh and speak ill of him.<br /><br />After a while that man passed away while Shaikh Ibn Baaz was on Hajj. When his body was brought forward after one of the obligatory prayers to be prayed over, the Imaam, who was one of the students of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, asked, ‘Who is the deceased?’ They said, ‘So and so.’ He said, ‘The one who spoke ill of Shaikh Ibn Baaz and swore at him? By Allaah, I won’t pray over him!’<br /><br />We prayed over him along with the people. [Afterwards] some people were saying that this Imaam who didn’t pray over that man will have a high and privileged standing in the eyes of Shaikh ’Abdul-’Aziz.<br /><br />When the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, came back from Hajj, they told him that that man had passed away, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">so he asked for Allaah’s mercy for him</span></strong>. Then they told him that the Imaam didn’t pray over him—<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">and the Shaikh became angry, visibly so, and he wasn’t pleased [at all]</span></strong>. Then he told someone, either ’Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jallaal or someone else, to take him to the graveyard,<strong><span style="color: #0000FF"> and [when he got there] he stood at the grave of that man and prayed and supplicated for him.”</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz, Duroos wa Mawaaqif wa ’Ibar, p. 67.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13/take-heed-and-use-your-brain-this-is-how-its-done-the-man-who-abused-and-cursed-ibn-baaz-and-who-then-passed-away-the-gentleness-mercy-and-understanding-of-ibn-baaz/">https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13 ... -ibn-baaz/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 18, 2017 12:42 am</p><hr />
