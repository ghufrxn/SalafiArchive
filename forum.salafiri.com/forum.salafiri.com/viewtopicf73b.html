They said it is Umar’s. I wanted to enter it and see it then I remembered your Ghira (possessive jealousy).’<br /><br />Then Umar said: Let my parents be sacrificed for you O Allaah’s Messenger how dare I think of my Ghira being offended by you?’<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–said: ‘If there were to be a Prophet after me it would have been Umar al-Khattab.’<br /><br />Narrated by Uqbah bin Aamir, &amp; collected by Ahmad, Tirmidhee &amp; Hakim, &amp; made Hasan by al-Albaanee in Saheehah (327).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ayesha daughter of Abu Bakr as-Sideeq –Radi Allaahu anhum</span></strong><br /><br />She is Ayesha daughter of Abu Bakr as-Sideeq –Radi Allaahu anhum– wife of the Messenger of Allaah, after Khadija –Radi Allaahu anha– had died, the Angel Jibra’eel had shown her to the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– in his dream before he married her, she was 18 years of age when the Messenger of Allaah died.
