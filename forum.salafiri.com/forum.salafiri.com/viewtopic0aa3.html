				<h3>Praying for the Muslim Ruler</h3>

				<div class="content">It is reported that Al-Fudayl b. ‘Ayyâd – Allâh have mercy on him – said, “If I had one supplication that was going to be answered I would make it for the ruler (imâm), for the wellbeing and righteousness of the imâm means wellbeing for the land and its people.”<br /><br /><em>Al-Dhahabî, Siyar A’lâm Al-Nubalâ` in his biography of Al-Fudayl b. ‘Ayyâd.</em><br /><br />Points to note<br /><br />Wanting good for the Muslim rulers and supplicating to Allâh for them features as an important aspect of the creed of Ahl Al-Sunnah wa Al-Jamâah, and distinguishes them from the extremist ideology of the Khawârij sect. This has been recorded in the classical works of Sunni ‘aqîdah, for example:<br /><br /><em>Al-Barbahârî (Sharh Al-Sunnah p113, 114)</em> states, “If you see a man supplicating against the ruler, know that he is a heretic (sahib hawâ), and if you see a man supplicating for the ruler, know that he is a Sunni – inshâ Allâh.”<br /><br /><em>Al-Imâm Al-Âjurrî (d360H) states (Al-Sharî’ah Vol.1 p371)</em>, “I have mentioned warnings against the ways of the Khawârij that convey the message for everyone who Allâh protects against the ways of the Khawârij, and who does not hold the views of the Khawârij, but is [instead] patient over the injustice of the rulers … and who prays for the wellbeing and righteousness of the rulers, and who does Hajj and Jihâd behind the rulers against every enemy of the Muslims, and who prays the Jumu’ah and ‘Eid prayers behind the rulers. Whoever fits this description is upon the Straight Path – inshâ Allâh.”<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/praying-for-the-muslim-ruler/">https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/prayi ... lim-ruler/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Withholding from supplicating for the Muslim Rulers – Shaykh Al Fawzaan</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</span><br /><br />What do you say about the one who says its not a must for him to supplicate for the (Muslim) ruler?<br /><br />(You say this) because you do not love the ruler, and this is a proof of hypocrisy. The ruler of the Muslims is loved, this is the way of the believers, that they love the Muslim rulers and make dua for their success and their guidance and for them to be aided (by Allah), because their guidance is guidance for the Muslims. And if they are guided, Allah benefits the Muslims by them.<br /><br />Supplicating for them is from Sincere advice, and the Religion is sincere advice to Allah, his messenger, the rulers of the muslims and the general people. (1)<br /><br />And the salaf used to supplicate for the Muslim rulers upon the minbar, supplicating for their success and rectification and their guidance because this is rectification of the Muslims and a benefit for the Muslims. (2)<br /><br />And this (statement) is not possible except from he who has a soul of the khawaarij, a soul of hypocrisy.<br /><br />And Allah’s refuge is sought.<br /><br />From the lecture:<br />أسباب محبة الله<br />————–<br />(1) The famous hadith of Tameem Ad-Daarimi (May Allah be pleased with him) as reported in Saheeh Muslim<br /><br />(2) It is reported that Al-Fudayl bin Ayyad [Allah have mercy on him] said, ‘If I had one supplication that was going to be answered I would make it for the ruler (imam), for the wellbeing and righteousness of the imam means wellbeing for the land and its people.’<br /><br /><em>Al-Dhahabi, Siyar A’lam Al-Nubala` in his biography of Al-Fudayl b. Ayyad.</em><br /><br />Please see following link for further statements of the Salaf on praying for the Muslim Ruler<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/praying-for-the-muslim-ruler/">http://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/prayin ... lim-ruler/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />We ask Allah The Lord of the Tremendous Throne to rectify the affairs of our Muslim rulers, to make them from the righteous and to benefit Islaam and the Muslims by way of them.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">آمين</span></div>
