<title type="html"><![CDATA[(9) The Balance of the Salafees in Dealing With Innovators]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=99&amp;p=103#p103"><![CDATA[
Shaykh  ul-Islām  Ibn  Taymiyyah  (rahimahullāh)  said:  “So  for example, the Imāms of innovation from the people who have statements which oppose the  Book  and  the  Sunnah  or  actions  of   worship  which  oppose  the  Book  and  the Sunnah, then their condition has to be clarified and it is obligatory to warn the Ummah against them by agreement of  the Muslims. to the extent that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: “If a man fasts, prays and secludes himself in the worship of Allāh, is this more beloved to you or talking about the people of innovation?” Imām Ahmad replied: “When a person prays, fasts and secludes himself in worship then this is only for himself, yet if he speaks about the people of innovation this is for the Muslims and thus is more virtuous.” He made clear that the benefit for this is for the general Muslims in their religion and is a type of jihād in the path of Allāh wherein the path of Allāh is purified  along with His religion, His Methods and His  Divine  Legislation  (from  the  heresies  of   the  innovators)  and  it  prevents  their transgression and enmity. For this reason, it is obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims and if this was not established for Allāh to prevent the harms of those  innovators  then  the  religion  would  become  corrupted  and  this  harm  would  be much worse than the enemy during warfare gaining power. this is because when these enemies take control they do not corrupt the hearts or the religion that is within the hearts.  But  as  for  those  (innovators)  then  they  corrupt  the  hearts  from  the  outset.”(Majmu al-Fataawa vol. 28 page 231-232.)<br /><br />“If   an  innovator  is  calling  to  his  corrupted  beliefs  which  oppose the Book and the Sunnah, and it is feared that he will misguide the people then his  situation  has  to  be  explained  to  the  people  so  that  they  are  conscious  of   his misguidance  and  know  about  him.  All  of   this  is  obligatory  as  a  form  of   advice and seeking the Countenance of Allāh and not for personal desire with the people.”(Majmu al-Fataawa vol 28 page 221) <br /><br />Consider!, the IJMAA (consensus) of the salafee, past and present, in warning against the innovator and his innovation. So what about the salafee who sees no harm in the innovator and instead looks for ways of  cooperating with the innovator rather than creating the distance of  the east and west between him and the innovator. We do not need to go into specific occurrences concerning the dawah in the UK to exemplify this point and those who have some understanding will see what is being said here!<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not-differ-la-tafarraqu/">http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not- ... tafarraqu/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:15 am</p><hr />
