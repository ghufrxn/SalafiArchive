				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Manner In Wiping Over The Head During Wudhoo’ For The Women: </span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Is it prescribed for a woman, when wiping over the head during Wudhoo’, to begin from the front of the head and the go towards the back, and then finally to come back to the front, as is prescribed for a man? <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> Yes, this is the case because concerning Islaamic rulings, whatever is established for men is also established for women and vice versa, except if there is a specific proof that shows that a ruling only applies to men and not women or vice versa. In this issue, I do not know of any proof that is specific to women only. Thus, she should also, like a man, wipe over the head from the front to the back. If the hair is long, it will not be affected by this, since the purpose is not to press hard on the hair till they become soaked or to reach the scalp; rather the wiping should be done with calmness and tranquillity. <br /><br /><em>Fatwa Essential Rulings For Every Muslim Women By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn al-`Uthaymeen pg. 65</em></div>
