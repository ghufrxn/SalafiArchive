But rather everyone is moving towards passing away as Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><br />كُلُّ مَنۡ عَلَيۡهَا فَانٖ ٢٦ وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِ ٢٧</span><br /><br />– Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.  –[Rahman: 26-27]<br /><br />Some of the people of knowledge said: ‘The Mushrikoon used to reject his -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – Prophet hood, and they would say: ‘Muhammad is a poet we await for him some calamity after some time, and perhaps he will die just like such and such poet died from such and such tribe. So Allaah Ta’ala mentioned that indeed Prophets before you died, and Allaah has power over His religion with victory and protection, this is how the Deen and Sharia of the Prophet is protected.’<br /><br />With this Ayaah, it indicates that al-Khidr has indeed died, whether he was a Wali (friend of Allaah Azza wa Jal), or a Prophet, or Messenger, because he was a human being, and he was present at the time of Moosa –alayhim as-Salaam. And Allaah Azza wa Jal had indeed said:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><br />وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا لِبَشَرٖ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ ٱلۡخُلۡدَۖ<br /></span><br />– And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad) –<br /><br />[From ‘Min Kanooz Qur’aan’ by Shaykh AbdulMuhsin p.118]<br /><br />Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya<br /><br />All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.<br /><br />– See more at: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.miraathpublications.net/day-30-seeking-forgiveness/#sthash.sMH4UER4.dpuf">http://www.miraathpublications.net/day- ... 4UER4.dpuf</a><!-- m --></div>
