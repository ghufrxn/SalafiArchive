<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Term Tawheed In Hadeeth]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=252&amp;p=261#p261"><![CDATA[
<strong><em>TABLE OF CONTENTS </em></strong><br /><br />1) Ahadeeth that mention the word tawheed <br />2) Some Objections by Muslims <br />3) Conclusion <br /><br />Some people say the word tawheed is a newly concocted term. This is not the case. Not only books have been written with this title such as Kitaab at-tawheed of Ibn Khuzayma and Kitaab at-tawheed of Ibn Mandah rahimahumullah but this term is easily detected in the sunan as well. Some of the ahadeeth which have this term will be presented below. Not only do these ahadeeth display the term but also the importance of tawheed - something which many people neglect today or consider inferior or a redundant topic to study about -<br /><br />Now since the term Tawheed in the below ahadeeth will be highlighted and coloured with red , so i won't be mentioning or repeating it's mention under the hadeeth. But what i would do is apart from this tawheed wording matter, i will in a line or two max. jot down the benefit we learn from that particular hadeeth with regards to tawheed and it's importance and in some narrations i will mention an extra benifit that can be derived from the hadeeth and will not bullet point all the fawaid for it would lengthen the article and post beyond what was intended. <br /><br /><br />1) <br />أما أبوك فلو كان أقر بالتوحيد، فصمت وتصدقت عنه نفعه ذلك &quot;.<br /><br />`Amr bin Shu`aib narrated from his father, who narrated from his grandfather t that al-`Aas bin Wa’il made an oath during the pre-Islamic times (al-Jahiliyyah) that he would slaughter one hundred goats and that Hisham bin al-`Aas slaughtered his share of 50 goats.  Then `Amr bin al-`Aas asked the Prophet (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) about that, and he said, “As for your father, if he affirmed Tawheed and you fast and give charity on his behalf, it would benefit him.” <br /><br />[Ref: Imam Ahmad narrated this, See silsilah saheeha (484)] <br /><br />Benefit: <br /><br />- A man who does not die upon tawheed (such as a Muslim Mushrik upon whom the Hujjah was established and his denial was out of arrogance of any form (includes nationalism and akaabireen parasti) ) then charity and fasting is not going to benefit him. <br /><br /><br />2)<br /><br />9827 وعن الحارث بن الحارث قال : قلت لأبي : ما هذه الجماعة ؟ قال : هؤلاء القوم الذين اجتمعوا على صابئ لهم . قال : فنزلنا فإذا رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يدعو الناس إلى توحيد الله عز وجل ، والإيمان به ، وهم يردون عليه ، ويؤذونه حتى انتصف النهار ، وانصدع الناس عنه ، أقبلت امرأة قد بدا نحرها تحمل قدحا ومنديلا ، فتناوله منها فشرب وتوضأ ثم رفع رأسه ، فقال : &quot; يا بنية ، خمري عليك نحرك ، ولا تخافين على أبيك &quot; . قلنا : من هذه ؟ قالوا : هذه زينب بنته . رواه الطبراني ، ورجاله ثقات . <br /><br />Al-Harith bin al-Harith al-Ghamidi said, “I said to my father, ‘What is that group?’ He said, ‘Those are a people following a Sabian among them.’  So, we continued on and found Allah’s Messenger (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) calling the people to the Tawheed of Allah , and to have faith in Him. All the while, they were rebuking and hurting him until it became midday and then people left from around him.  A woman (In tabraani the wording is  جَارِيَةٌ a young girl and this is more appropriate as per the seerah with regards to the age of Zaynab r.a) , who’s neck (upper portion of the chest) was uncovered, appeared carrying a cup of water and a handkerchief; the Prophet drank from it and made ablution, then raised his head saying, “O girl, cover your upper portion of the chest (i.e the neck portion) and do not fear for your father.’  We said, ‘Who is that?’ They said, ‘This is his daughter, Zaynab.’ <br /><br />[Ref: Collected by at-Tabarani in, Al-Kabir, 3373, Ibn Abi `Asim in, al-Ahadeeth wa al-Mathani, 2403, and refer to, Jilbab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, pg. 79. Imam al-Haythami brought this in Majma` az-zawaid and classed the narrators to be trustworthy however some have inclined towards it's weakness] <br /><br />Benefits : <br /><br />- Calling to the people only to have faith in Allah is not complete. Rather as the prophet sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam did, i.e calling to having faith PLUS affirming tawheed is the actual and complete way <br /><br />- Young girls are also forbidden from disclosing their body parts out in the public. Not only is this from the islamic shar`iah and manners of a woman but also from the Muslim, especially `Arab culture by large until the last 2-3 decades. We still have paintings in museusms and videos and carols showing how young small girls in the `Arab streets back in the days used to wear a full long headscarf covering their bossoms and neck. Even though they were girls, but this was the culture they were raised in. We see some of it still being implemented in Pakistan, Afghanisthan, some parts of the `Arab world , Indonesia and some towns in India.  We ask allah to remove Muslims from the inferiority complex they have from the west and bring them back to Islamic values and accordingly the respective Muslim culture. <br /><br /><br />3) <br /><br />كَانَ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يُضَحِّيَ اشْتَرَى كَبْشَيْنِ عَظِيمَيْنِ سَمِينَيْنِ أَقْرَنَيْنِ أَمْلَحَيْنِ مَوْجُوءَيْنِ فَذَبَحَ أَحَدَهُمَا عَنْ أُمَّتِهِ لِمَنْ شَهِدَ لِلَّهِ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لَهُ بِالْبَلاَغِ وَذَبَحَ الآخَرَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَنْ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ ‏.‏<br /><br />Abu Hurairah t reported that when Allah’s Messenger (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) wanted to slaughter, he would buy two castrated great white rams with some black sections with horns. He would slaughter one of them on behalf of his Ummah, for those who believe in Allah while affirming Tawheed and who believe that he conveyed the Message, and he would slaughter the second on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) <br /><br />[Ref: Ibn Majah, 3122, and refer to, Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 1138]<br /><br />Benefits <br /><br />- Believing in Allah is something even the Mushrikeen Makkah did, but believing WHILE AFFIRMING TAWHEED is what is unique to the Muslims. <br /><br />- As mentioned/shown in the first hadeeth, even here the prophet sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam sacrificed for only that portion of his Ummah that believed in Allah WHILE affirming the tawheed. <br /><br />4) <br /><br />يُعَذَّبُ نَاسٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ التَّوْحِيدِ فِي النَّارِ حَتَّى يَكُونُوا فِيهَا حُمَمًا ثُمَّ تُدْرِكُهُمُ الرَّحْمَةُ فَيُخْرَجُونَ وَيُطْرَحُونَ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ ‏.‏ قَالَ فَيَرُشُّ عَلَيْهِمْ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْمَاءَ فَيَنْبُتُونَ كَمَا يَنْبُتُ الْغُثَاءُ فِي حِمَالَةِ السَّيْلِ ثُمَّ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ <br /><br />Jabir bin `Abdillah (r.a) said, “Allah’s Messenger (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘People of Tawheed will be punished in Hellfire, until they turn into coal, then mercy will descend on them and they will exit, and will be placed by the doors of Paradise.  The people of Paradise will pour water on them, and they will grow like the tree branches, leaves, and seeds that grow in the aftermath of floods; then they will enter Paradise.”<br /><br />[Ref: Ahmad (3/391); See Silsilah Saheeha 2451] <br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />- A warning to the people of tawheed in this hadeeth to not assume that their tawheed would help them against the oppression, tyranny, back biting and sins they commit in this world. <br /><br /><br />It is narrated that Mu`adh ibn Jabal said, <br /><br />&quot;The Qur`an will become worn out in the hearts of a people just like a garment becomes worn out and is ruined, they will read it but they shall feel no desire towards it nor any sweetness. They are but wolves in sheep’s clothing, their deeds are in greed without any fear (of Allah). If they fall short they say ‘We shall attain’ and if they fall into sin they say ‘WE SHALL BE FORGIVEN (AS) WE DO NOT COMMIT SHIRK WITH ALLAH.<br /><br />[Ref: Narrated by Darimi, no . 3346; Ibn Asakir in Tareekh ad-Dimishq 67/97; Daylami in Al Firdaws 3/444]<br /><br />- The people of tawheed are specifically distinctly mentioned here to be removed from hell fire. This is a powerful statement and glad tidings to those who do not associate anything with Allah in his attributes or worship and power. <br /><br /><br />5) <br /><br />Ja`far bin Muhammad narrated that his father said, “We entered on Jabir bin `Abdillah, and he asked about who was with him, until he reached me and I said, ‘I am Muhammad bin `Ali bin Husain.’ Then, he reached his hand towards my head, unbuttoned my top and bottom buttons and placed his hand on my chest – and I was a young boy back then – and said, ‘Welcome, O nephew, ask what you wish.’<br /><br />So I asked him – and he was blind – until it was time for prayer, then he stood. He had a woven piece (of cloth) wrapped around him which was so small that every time he tried to pull it onto his shoulders its edges would uncover another part of his body, and his garment was to his side on the clothing rail.  He led us in prayer, and I asked said, ‘Tell me about the hajj of Allah’s Messenger r.’  He signaled with his hand and nine people gathered around him, and he said, ‘Allah’s Messenger r spent nine years without making pilgrimage. Then, in the tenth year, it was announced to the people that Allah’s Messenger r would be making the pilgrimage.  Many people came to Madinah, all of them wishing to take Allah’s Messenger r as an Imam, and to do as he does.  So, we went out [on pilgrimage] with him.  When we reached Thi al-Hulaifah, Asma’ bint `Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr and asked Allah’s Messenger r what she should do.  He said, ‘Perform ghusl (shower), istathfiri (meaning wear your garment in a manner which resembles underwear [overlapping the woman’s private areas] and which helps to stop the bleeding of a woman) and then begin ihram (the act of `umrah or hajj).’  So Allah’s Messenger r prayed in the masjid and rode al-Qaswa’ (his camel), until the camel sat in the desert.  I looked as far as I could at those who rode and walked and as many as there were in front of him, there were to his right, to his left, and behind him.  Allah’s Messenger r was still among us, the Qur’an was still being revealed to him, he knows its explanation, and we did everything he did.  He glorified Allah using Tawhid, saying, ‘Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik, Labbaika Laa Shareeka Laka Labbaik, Inna al-Hamda wa an-Ni`mata Laka wa al-Mulk, La Shareeka Lak (O Allah I am here at your service, O Allah obedience is to you without associates, indeed praise, blessings and kingship are yours, there is no associate with you.’  The people also glorified Allah with these words.’”<br /><br />[Ref: al-Bukhari, 5571, and Muslim, 3009 - see sunnah.com] <br /><br /><br />6) <br /><br />(كانَ رجلٌ ممَّن كان قبلكم لم يعمل خيراً قطُّ؛ إلا التوحيد، فلما احتُضر قال لأهله: انظروا: إذا أنا متُّ أن يحرِّقوه حتى يدعوه حمماً، ثم اطحنوه، ثم اذروه في يوم ريح، [ثم اذروا نصفه في البر، ونصفه في البحر، فوالله؛ لئن قدر الله عليه ليعذبنه عذاباً لا يعذبه أحداً من العالمين] ، فلما مات فعلوا ذلك به، [فأمر الله البر فجمع ما فيه، وأمر البحر فجمع ما فيه] ، فإذا هو [قائم] في قبضة الله،<br /><br /><br />The Prophet (sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, “There was a man who came before you who did no good whatsoever, except Tawheed. When his time to die came, he said to his family, ‘Look, if I die have my body burnt to coal, then make them into ashes and wait for a windy day and throw half of the ashes in the desert, and half in the ocean.  By Allah, if Allah decides to punish my body, He will punish it like none other in the universe.’  When he died they did as he requested to his body, and Allah ordered the desert to gather whatever it had of him in it and the ocean likewise, until he stood in Allah’s Grasp. Allah U said, ‘O son of Adam, what caused you to do what you did?’ He said, ‘O Lord, I did so out of fear of you’ – and in another narration, ‘out of awe in you, and you know best–.’   The Prophet said, ‘Allah forgave him because of it, and he did no good actions, besides Tawheed.’” <br /><br />[Ref: Collected in, As-Sahihah, 3048] <br /><br />This hadeeth needs to be understood in depth by referring to the books of `Aqeedah and it's explanation for this has some thing which needs to be explained lest the common people mis-understand it as something else. This article is not intended for such clarifications <br /><br /><br />Benefits <br /><br />- There is a verse in the Qur`an that says on the day of judgement everyone will come/be put behind their Imaam. The ahl al-hadeeth have interpreted this verse to prove that for them Muhammad sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam would be the Imaam. And this hadeeth uses the word Imaam too addressing the Prophet sallalahu `alayhi wa sallam.  I just thought this is a good point to ponder upon <br /><br />- Jaabir ibn `Abdullah (r.a) clearly first stated the term tawheed and specified that praising allah USING TAWHEED. This is a proof that even in praise or gratitude we need to make sure we keep the tawheed in mind . Thus praising anyone else or praising Allah in a way that compromises the tawheed goes against the sunnah of the prophet and his sahaaba. The meanings of tawheed in that talbiyah is so clear that it needs no explanation <br /><br /><br />7) <br /> وَأَدْرَجَ فِي الْحَدِيثِ عِنْدَ قَوْلِهِ ‏{‏ وَاتَّخِذُوا مِنْ مَقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ‏}‏ قَالَ فَقَرَأَ فِيهَا بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَ ‏{‏ قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ ‏}<br /><br />In this hadeeth it reports that Jaabir Ibn `Abdullah (r.a) said the verse &quot; Qul yaa ayyuhal Kaafiroon&quot; was the verse of tawheed <br /><br />[Ref: Sunan Abi Dawud 1909] <br /><br /><br />2) Some Objections <br /><br />What about the hadeeth : <br /><br />Ubadah bin as-Samit (radhiallahu `anhu) reported that the Prophet r said, “Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship but Allah, and that Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger, then Allah has made Hellfire forbidden for them.’ [Tirmidhi] <br /><br />Answer by Imam Tirmidhi himself 1200 years ago <br /><br />فَقَالَ إِنَّمَا كَانَ هَذَا فِي أَوَّلِ الإِسْلاَمِ قَبْلَ نُزُولِ الْفَرَائِضِ وَالأَمْرِ وَالنَّهْىِ ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو عِيسَى وَوَجْهُ هَذَا الْحَدِيثِ عِنْدَ بَعْضِ أَهْلِ الْعِلْمِ أَنَّ أَهْلَ التَّوْحِيدِ سَيَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَإِنْ عُذِّبُوا بِالنَّارِ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ لاَ يُخَلَّدُونَ فِي النَّارِ ‏.‏ وَقَدْ رُوِيَ عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ مَسْعُودٍ وَأَبِي ذَرٍّ وَعِمْرَانَ بْنِ حُصَيْنٍ وَجَابِرِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ وَابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ وَأَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ وَأَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّهُ قَالَ ‏&quot;‏ سَيَخْرُجُ قَوْمٌ مِنَ النَّارِ مِنْ أَهْلِ التَّوْحِيدِ وَيَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏ هَكَذَا رُوِيَ عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ جُبَيْرٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ النَّخَعِيِّ وَغَيْرِ وَاحِدٍ مِنَ التَّابِعِينَ وَقَدْ رُوِيَ مِنْ غَيْرِ وَجْهٍ عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي تَفْسِيرِ هَذِهِ الآيَةَِ‏:‏ ‏(‏رُبَمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ كَانُوا مُسْلِمِينَ‏)‏ قَالُوا إِذَا أُخْرِجَ أَهْلُ التَّوْحِيدِ مِنَ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلُوا الْجَنَّةَ يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ كَانُوا مُسْلِمِينَ ‏.‏<br /><br />Summarized Trans :<br /><br />At-Tirmidhi after mentioning this hadeeth “This was before the obligations, orders, and prohibitions were revealed.” Then he said, “It has been narrated from Ibn Mas`ud, Abu Tharr, `Imran bin Husain, Jabir bin `Abdillah, Ibn `Abbas, Abu Sa`id al-Khudri, and Anas from the Prophet r that he said, “A group of people from among those of Tawhid will exit Hellfire and enter Paradise.”“This has also been narrated from Sa`id bin Jubair, Ibrahim an-Nakha`i and others among the tabi`in when explaining the ayah, ‘Perhaps (often) [at that time] will those who disbelieve wish that they were Muslims.’ (15:2)”.....<br /><br /><br />3) Conclusion<br /><br /><br />I have not compiled this article to encourage, motivate or even arm the takfeeris with anything that they would use to make blatant takfeer. When it comes to Kufr and shirk there are two important things to take care of; rather three <br /><br />1) The scholars have laid down the principles stating this and this action is Kufr or shirk al-Akbar <br /><br />2) however when this principle is applied muqayyad or specifically to individuals there are various barriers and rules that are to be followed <br /><br />3) Lastly this issue of tashreek or takfeer is what we might as well say the copy right of the `Ulema. Laymen, students of knowledge are not allowed to make takfeer or tashreek of Muslims . The case has to be submitted to Ahl al-`Ilm, they will analyse the individual or the group and then pass their fatwa <br /><br />Neither of the ahadeeth I jotted down above was intended to serve or use against the deviant Muslims indulged in some or the other grade of shirk , rather this article was aimed to remove <br /><br />a) the misconception that the prophetic traditions never had the word tawheed <br /><br />b) the importance of tawheed and the distinction between tawheed and simple utterance of Laa Ilaaha Illallah. <br /><br /><br />Read more In sha Allah: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://the-finalrevelation.blogspot.com/2015/02/showing-the-term-tawheed-being-used-in.html#ixzz3XcMjkPXV">http://the-finalrevelation.blogspot.com ... z3XcMjkPXV</a><!-- m --> <br />Follow us: thefinalrevelation on Facebook<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Sep 03, 2016 3:00 am</p><hr />
