<strong>بسم الله والحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله ، وبعد<br /></strong><br />Narrated Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree رضي الله عنه: Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝When you hear the Adhaan, repeat what the Muadhdhin (the call-maker) says.❞</strong></span><br /><strong>[Saheehain]</strong><br /><br />`Abdullaah bin `Amr bin al-`Aas رضي الله عنهما reported: I heard the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ saying: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝When you hear the Adhaan, repeat what the Muadhdhin says. Then send Salah upon me (i.e. invoke blessings on me) because everyone who does so will receive in return ten blessings from Allaah. Then beseech Allaah to grant me al-Waseelah, which is a high rank in Jannah, fitting for only one of Allaah’s slaves; and I hope that I will be that man. Whoever asks that I be given al-Waseelah, he will be assured of my intercession.❞</strong></span><br /><strong>[Saheeh Muslim (384), Sunan Abu Dawood (523), Sunan al-Tirmidhee (3614), Sunan al-Nasaa’ee (678)]</strong><br /><br />`Umar Ibn al-Khattaab رضي الله عنه said: Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝When the Muadhdhin says: اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ اللَّهُ أَكْبَر (Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest), then one of you should make this response: اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ اللَّهُ أَكْبَر (Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest); (and when the Muadhdhin) says: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ (I testify that there is no one worthy of worship except Allaah), one should respond: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ (I testify that there is no one worthy of worship except Allaah), and when he says: أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ‏ (I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah), one should make a response: أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ‏ (I testify that Muhammad is Allaah's Messenger). When he (the Muadhdhin) says: حَىَّ عَلَى الصَّلاَةِ ‏ (Come to prayer), one should make a response: لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّه‏ (There is no might and no power except with Allaah). When he (the Muadhdhin) says: حَىَّ عَلَى الْفَلاَح (Come to salvation), one should respond: لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّه ‏ (There is no might and no power except with Allaah), and when he (the Muadhdhin) says: Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest, then make a response: اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ اللَّهُ أَكْبَر (Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest). When he (the Muadhdhin) says: لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ (There is no one worthy of worship except Allaah), then make a response: لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ (There is no one worthy of worship except Allaah). And he who makes a response from the heart: I testify that there is no one worthy of worship except Allaah, he will enter Paradise.❞</strong></span><br /><strong>[Saheeh Muslim (385), Sunan Abu Dawood (527)]</strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000"><strong>Shaikh Ibn al-`Uthaymeen رحمه الله:<br /></strong></span><br />❝The virtue (of repeating the Adhaan), as mentioned in the Ahaadeeth, the Prophet ﷺ instructed us that when we hear the Muadhdhin calling the Adhaan, to say as he says. If he says: “Allaah is the Greatest”, we should also repeat: “Allaah is the Greatest”. When he says: “I testify that there is no one worthy of worship except Allaah”, we should also say: “I testify that there is no one worthy of worship except Allaah”. When he says: “I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah”, we should also say: “I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah”. Except when he says: “Come to prayer, come to salvation”, we do not repeat this because we are the ones being invited, and the Muadhdhin is the one who is inviting. So it is not correct for us to repeat: “Come to prayer” after the Muadhdhin, rather we are to say the words of seeking help: “There is no might and no power except with Allaah”. These words mean that we have accepted the call and now we seek Allaah’s عز وجل help (for fulfilling our responsibilities). This is why I say that these words are the words of seeking help through which a person seeks to correct his affairs and rectify his condition. This is why, in the story of the man with two gardens, the Believer said to him: <br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">وَلَوْلَا إِذْ دَخَلْتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلْتَ مَا شَاءَ اللَّـهُ لَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّـهِ<br /></span><br /><span style="color: #008000"><strong>{It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: “That which Allaah wills (will come to pass)! There is no power but with Allaah”}</strong></span><br /><strong>[Surah al-Kahf (18): 39]<br /></strong><br /><br />Meaning: It would have been better for you and you would have safeguarded your garden from getting ruined.<br /><br />This indeed is a great phrase. The Prophet ﷺ said to `Abdullaah Ibn Qais – Abu Moosaa al-Ash`aree رضي الله عنه: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝Shall I not guide you to a treasure from the treasures of Jannah?❞</strong></span> He (Abu Moosaa) said: “Yes, O Messenger of Allaah!” Thereupon he ﷺ said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝(Recite): “Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah” (There is no might and no power except with Allaah).❞</strong></span><br /><strong>[Saheehain]</strong><br /><br />So, when the Muadhdhin says: “Come to prayer, come to success”, we should say: “There is no might and no power except with Allaah”. When he says during the Fajr Adhaan: “The prayer is better than sleep”, we should also say: “The prayer is better than sleep”. When he says: “Allaah is the Greatest”, we should also say: “Allaah is the Greatest”. And when he says: “There is no one worthy of worship except Allaah”, we should repeat: “There is no one worthy of worship except Allaah”.<br /><br />After that, we should invoke Allaah’s blessing upon the Prophet ﷺ, saying: “Allaahumma Sallee `alaa Muhammad…” (O Allaah! Bestow Your favors on Muhammad…), and whoever invokes Allaah’s blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ once, he will receive Allaah’s blessings ten times.<br /><br />Then we should beseech Allaah to grant al-Waseelah to the Prophet ﷺ:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>اللهم رب هذه الدعوة التامة والصلاة القائمة آت محمدا الوسيلة والفضيلة وابعثه مقاما محمودا الذي وعدته (إنك لا تخلف الميعاد)<br /></strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>Allaahumma rabba haadhihi-d-da`wati-t-taammah, wal-salaati-l-qaaimah, aati  Muhammadani-l-waseelata wal-fadheelah, wab `ath-hu maqaama-mahmoodan al-ladhee wa`adtahu, [innaka laa tukhliful-mee`aad]</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>O Allaah, Rabb of this perfect call and of the established prayer, grant Muhammad the Waseelah and superiority, and raise him up to a praiseworthy position which You have promised him. [Verily! You do not neglect promises]</strong></span><br /><strong>[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (614, 4719). The words within the brackets are from Sunan al-Baihaqee and this addition opposes the other authentic narrations. See al- Dha`eefah (11/293/5181) and also al-Irwa (1/260-261)]</strong><br /><br />So, if we seek Allaah’s blessing on the Prophet ﷺ and beseeched Allaah to grant him al-Waseelah, then intercession will be assured for us, meaning: the Prophet ﷺ will intercede for us (on the Day of Judgment). Al-Waseelah is a high rank in the Jannah, the highest that can be (closer to Allaah), and this rank will not be given except to only one person. The Prophet ﷺ said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝I hope that I will be that man.❞</strong></span> And this hope, by Allaah’s Will, will be fulfilled (in the favor of our Prophet ﷺ), because we know that the best of creation with Allaah is the Prophet ﷺ, and because the Ummah of Muhammad beseeches Allaah to grant him that rank after every Adhaan. And the supplication between the Adhaan and `Iqaamah is not rejected. Every person in this (Muslim) Ummah says: “O Allaah! Grant al-Waseelah to Muhammad!” And the Ummah of Muhammad, by Allaah’s permission, is worthy that if they supplicate to Allaah to grant al-Waseelah to Muhammad, then Allaah will accept it from this Ummah, this is why the Prophet ﷺ said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>❝I hope that I will be that man.❞</strong></span><br /><br />Therefore, when we hear the Muadhdhin, it is necessary for us to repeat what he says, if we are reciting (the Qur’aan), then we should stop reciting and repeat after the Muadhdhin. When we are done with this, we can go back to reciting (the Qur’aan).❞<br /><strong>[Sharh Riyaadh al-Saaliheen (5/35-38)]</strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46440">AbuDahlia</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2021 6:44 pm</p><hr />

بسم الله والحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله ، وبعد<br /><strong><br />Part #1:<br />Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله:</strong><br />The Prophet ﷺ forbade from imitating the animals while in prayers. For he ﷺ forbade from kneeling like a camel [1], and from looking here and there like a fox [2], and resting (spreading the forearms) on the ground like a wild beast [3], and squatting like a dog [4], and pecking like a crow [5], and from raising the hands like wild horses while concluding the Salaah with the Tasleem [6]. The actions of the one who is praying are different from the actions of the animals.<br />[Zaad al-Ma`aad (1/217-218)]<br /><br /><strong>NOTES:</strong><br />[1] Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه reported the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ as saying: <strong>❝When one of you prostrates, he must not kneel in the manner of a camel, but should put his hands down before his knees.❞</strong><br />[Sunan Abu Dawood (840), Sunan al-Nasaa’ee (1091) and graded as “Saheeh” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br />[2] Narrated `Aaishah رضي الله عنها: I asked the Prophet ﷺ about one’s looking here and there during the prayer. He ﷺ replied: <strong>❝It is what Shaitaan steals from the prayer of any one of you.❞</strong><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (75, 3291)]<br /><br />Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه narrated that the Prophet ﷺ:<strong> ❝…forbade three things: pecking like a hen, squatting (Iq`aa') like a dog, and looking around like a fox.❞</strong><br />[Musnad Ahmed (8106) and graded as “Hasan li Ghairihee by Shaikh al-Albaanee in Saheeh al-Targheeb (555)]<br /><br />[3] Narrated `Aaishah رضي الله عنها: The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ: <strong>❝...forbade the people to spread out their arms (on the ground) like a wild beast (during Sujood).❞</strong><br />[Saheeh Muslim (498) part of a longer Hadeeth]<br /><br />[4] Anas رضي الله عنه narrated that the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ said;<strong> ❝Adopt a moderate position while in Sujood (prostration), and see that none of you stretches out his forearms (on the ground) like a dog.❞</strong><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (532, 822) and Saheeh Muslim (493)]<br /><br />Moderate position or doing the Sujood properly, meaning: the seven parts of the body – the forehead along with the nose, the two palms with fingers close to each other pointing towards the Qiblah, the two knees, and the toes of both the feet – should be touching the ground, and that the person should keep his forearms raised above the ground, keeping the arms (elbows) away from touching his chest or his sides, with the back raised high (i.e. the belly should not touch the thighs), and the thighs should not touch the calf.<br /><br />[5] `Abdul-Rahmaan Ibn Shibl رضي الله عنه said: The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ forbade three things: <strong>❝Pecking like a crow, resting one's forearms on the ground like a predator, and to fix the same place in the Masjid (for prayer) like a camel which gets used to a certain place.❞</strong><br />[Sunan Abu Dawood (862), Sunan Ibn Maajah (1429) and Sunan al-Nasaa’ee (1112) and graded as “Hasan” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br />[6] Jaabir bin Samurah رضي الله عنه narrated: We used to pray behind the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ and we would greet (each other) with our hands. He ﷺ said: <strong>❝What is the matter with those who greet (others) with their hands as if they were tails of wild horses? It is enough for you that one should place one’s hand on one’s thigh and then pronounce salutation upon one’s brother on the right side and then on the left.❞</strong><br />[Saheeh Muslim (430, 431)]<br /><br /><br /><strong>Part #2:<br />Shaikh Ibn al-`Uthaymeen رحمه الله:</strong><br />In the statement of the Prophet ﷺ: <strong>❝…and see that none of you stretches out his forearms (on the ground) like a dog❞</strong>, he ﷺ especially mentioned the dog here as sharp disapproval and censuring.<br /><br />In this Hadeeth, there is a clear indication that a person should not imitate animals. Similar has been mentioned in the Qur’aan when Allaah تعالى said:<br /><br />﴿مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ حُمِّلُوا التَّوْرَاةَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَحْمِلُوهَا كَمَثَلِ الْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا ۚ بِئْسَ مَثَلُ﴾<br /><strong><br />{The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Tauraah (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practice its legal laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey who carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example (or the likeness)…}</strong><br />[Surah al-Jumu`ah (62): 5]<br /><br />﴿فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ الْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث﴾<br /><strong><br />{So his description is the description of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out.}</strong><br />[Surah al-A`raaf (7): 176]<br /><br />﴿وَاقْصِدْ فِي مَشْيِكَ وَاغْضُضْ مِن صَوْتِكَ ۚ إِنَّ أَنكَرَ الْأَصْوَاتِ لَصَوْتُ الْحَمِيرِ﴾<br /><strong><br />{And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of donkeys.}</strong><br />[Surah Luqman (31): 19]<br /><br />And the Prophet ﷺ said: <strong>❝One who takes back his gift (which he has already given) is like a dog that swallows its vomit.❞</strong><br />[Saheehain]<br /><br />All these shows that a person should not imitate the animals. And from this, we also learn that a person should not imitate the sounds of animals, like the crowing of a rooster, or the barking of a dog, or the braying of a donkey.<br /><br />…Anyways, it is not befitting to imitate the animals for the children of Aadam about whom Allaah تعالى said:<br /><br />﴿وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلًا﴾<br /><br /> {and We preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.}<br />[Surah al-Israa (17): 70]<br /><br />And this is so much disliked to the extent that the Prophet ﷺ said:<strong> ❝It does not befit us to follow a bad example. The one who takes back his gift is like the dog who takes back his vomit.❞</strong><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (2622, 6975)]<br />[Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaaree of Ibn al-`Uthaymeen (2/364)]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46440">AbuDahlia</a> — Fri Dec 11, 2020 6:30 pm</p><hr />

What is better, reciting the Qur’aan or saying the Takbeeraat in the first 10 Days of Dhul-Hijjah and the days of Tashreeq (the three days following Eid al-Adhha, i.e. 11th, 12th, 13th of Dhul-Hijjah)?<br /><br />FIRST: People often make a comparison between the recitation of the Qur’aan and doing Dhikr, which they should not be doing. There is nothing that can be compared to the recitation of the Qur’aan, and as the Prophet ﷺ had said, the best Speech is the Book of Allaah.<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah ﷺ said: <br />❝The best talk (speech) is Allaah’s Book (the Qur’aan), and the best way (for guidance) is the way of Muhammad, and the worst matters are the heresies (those new things which are introduced into the religion).❞<br />[Saheeh Muslim]<br /><br />Moreover, the recitation of the Qur’aan itself is Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah). <br /><br />Furthermore, and the words of Dhikr are from the Qur’aan itself as the Prophet ﷺ had said:<br /><br />Samurah Ibn Jundub رضي الله عنه narrated that the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ said: <br />❝The best talk after the Qur’aan – and it is from the Qur’aan – are four, and it doesn’t matter with which you begin:<br /><br />سُبْحَانَ اللهِ <br />Subhaan-Allaah (Glory is to Allaah), <br /><br />وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ<br />wal-hamdu-lillaah (praise is to Allaah), <br /><br />وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ<br />wa laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah), <br /><br />وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ<br />wa Allaahu Akbar (and Allaah is the Most Great).❞<br />[Musnad Ahmad (20223) and the wording is his, Saheeh Muslim (2137), Sunan Ibn Maajah (3811)]<br /><br />SECOND: In general, the precedence is given to the recitation of the Qur’aan and the contemplation of its meaning, then to Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah), and then Du`aa (supplication). <br /><br />The recitation of the Qur’aan is general, meaning one can recite the Qur’aan at any time. But as for Dhikr, there are certain Dhikr which are bounded by time and place. So, preference is given to the actions which have been specifically mentioned for that period of time or place. Therefore, in these days saying the Takbeer should be given precedence as this has been recorded from the actions of the Sahaabah and the Salaf.<br /><br />Imaam al-Bukhaaree رحمه الله mentioned that Ibn `Umar and Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنهما used to go out to the market place and say aloud: “ALLAAHU AKBAR, ALLAAHU AKBAR” and the people would emulate them.<br /><br />And Shaikh Ibn al-`Uthaymeen رحمه الله had said that preference should be given to saying the Takbeer, but if one recites the Qur’aan then no one should stop him or criticize him, because the Qur’aan is Dhikr, rather the best of Dhikr. But saying the Takbeer has been specifically assigned for this period, whereas the recitation of the Qur’aan is for all time (and not bounded or limited by time). – end of quote.<br /><br />In the end, the best is to combine between all the different acts of `Ibaadah, and a person should spend some time in reciting the Qur’aan, then doing Dhikr and making Du`aa.<br /><br />And Allaah is the One who grants success.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46440">AbuDahlia</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2020 3:52 pm</p><hr />

And is it permissible to call Sacrifice as Sunnah Ibraheemi?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> This hadeeth is narrated by Imaam Ahmad(1) and ibn Majah(2), and Allâmah Albani Rahimahullah and others have labelled as Da'eef(3).<br /><br />As for Sacrifice being called Sunnah Ibraheemi, then it is correct and it's reference exist in  Qur'aan-e-Kareem, Allah Ta'ala says:<br />وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ -وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِي الْآخِرِينَ -(4)<br /><br />And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (i.e. a ram);<br />And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among generations (to come) in later times.<br /><br />From this we come to know that Sacrifice is Sunnah Ibraheemi, as well as Sunnah of Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, because The Messenger of Allāh Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam stayed in Madinah for ten years and used to sacrifice every year.<br />______<br />(1) Musnad Ahmad: 4/368<br />(2) Sunan ibn Majah: 2/1045 [3127] Chapters on Sacrifices,<br />(3) See Mishkat with Ta'leeq of Shaykh Albani: 1/464 [1476].<br />(4) As-Saffat 37:107-108.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Ni'matu al-Mannan Majmoo' Fataawa Fadhilat ad-Duktoor Fadhl ar-Rahman: Volume 6, Page:47-48.</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Source: Dr. Fadhl ar-Rahman Al-Madani Channel</strong><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">https://t.me/dr_fazlurrahman_almadni/179</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46555">SheikhAbdullah</a> — Fri Jun 26, 2020 2:14 pm</p><hr />

<span style="font-size: 123%; line-height: normal">بسم الله والحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله ، وبعد<br /><br /><strong>Imaam al-Bukhaaree</strong> mentioned in his Saheeh:<br /><br />Book: Call to Prayers (Adhaan)<br /><br />(149) Chapter: Invocation before the Tasleem<br /><br />Narrated Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq رضي الله عنه: I asked Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ to teach me an invocation so that I may invoke Allaah with it in my prayer. He ﷺ told me to say:<br /><br /><span style="color: #000080">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي ظُلْمًا كَثِيرًا، وَلاَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، فَاغْفِرْ لِي مَغْفِرَةً مِنْ عِنْدِكَ، وَارْحَمْنِي إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ<br /><br />❝Allaahumma innee dhalumtu nafsi zulman katheeraa, Wa laa yaghfiru dh-dhunooba illa anta, fa-ghfir lee maghfiratan min `indika, war-hamnee, innaka antal-ghafooru r-raheem<br /><br />(O Allaah! I have done great injustice to myself and none except You forgives sins, so bestow on me a forgiveness from You, and Have Mercy on me, You are the Forgiver, the Merciful).❞</span><br /><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (834, 6326, 7387) and Saheeh Muslim (2705-48)]<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000"><strong>Shaikh Ibn al-`Uthaymeen said:</strong></span><br />This Hadeeth has great importance because of the following reasons:<br /><br /><strong>First:</strong> from the perspective of the questioner and the one being questioned. The questioner is Abu Bakr and the one being questioned is the Prophet ﷺ. And the most beloved of people to the Prophet ﷺ was Abu Bakr. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Prophet ﷺ would choose for him the best and the most comprehensive Du`aa.<br /><br /><strong>Second:</strong> from the perspective of the style of the wording (of the Du`aa). This Du`aa is a collection of different types of Tawassul (means of asking Allaah for something earnestly and feelingly).<br /><br /><strong>In the saying:</strong> “O Allaah! I have done great injustice to myself”, is an earnest appeal using the state/situation of the one making the Du`aa.<br /><br />Part of making an earnest appeal in Du`aa is that a person makes an appeal by mentioning his situation. Like how Moosaa عليه السلام did:<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">رَبِّ إِنِّي لِمَا أَنزَلْتَ إِلَيَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ<br /><br /><strong>{&quot;My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!&quot;}</strong></span><br />[Surah al-Qasas (28): 24]<br /><br />And he (Moosaa عليه السلام) did not mention any other thing except this. He mentioned his state (in his Du`aa) - an indication that it (the Du`aa automatically) includes in it - that anyone who mentions his situation is beseeching Allaah to change it for the better.<br /><br /><strong>It also includes:</strong> Beseeching Allaah by mentioning His praises (as He deserves to be praised). And this is mentioned in his ﷺ saying: “and none except You forgives sins”. This is part of making an earnest appeal; that a person beseeches Allaah تعالى through one of His (Lofty) Attributes, appropriate as per the need.<br /><br /><strong>It also includes:</strong> Beseeching Allaah through His (Beautiful) Names, and that is in the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: “so bestow on me a forgiveness from You, and Have Mercy on me, You are the Oft-Forgiver, the Most-Merciful”. This is beseeching Allaah through His (Beautiful) Names.<br /><br /><strong>And in his ﷺ statement:</strong> “a forgiveness from You”, is an indication to the greatness of the thing that is being sought, because something to come from Allaah, is no doubt, more magnificent and numerous. And this is also another way of making an earnest appeal.<br /><br /><strong>Another benefit from this Hadeeth:</strong> A person should (make a habit) of supplicating with this supplication during the Salaah. But when should he supplicate?<br /><br />Answer: As per the apparent understanding of Imaam al-Bukhaaree رحمه الله, one should supplicate with this after the (Final) Tashahhud (and before the Tasleem), because he included this Hadeeth under the chapter heading: &lt;&gt;, but there is nothing clearly mentioned in the Hadeeth to support this, as in the Salaah, there are different places to make Du`aa: in the Sujood, in the sitting between the two Sujood, after getting up from Rukoo`. In all these have been mentioned in the Sunnah as the places to make Du`aa. So anything is possible. But yes, in some other narrations, the Prophet ﷺ instructed (the other companions to supplicate with whatever they want in the final Tashahhud) before the Salaam. So the same is to be applied.<br /><br /><strong>[Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaaree of Ibn al-`Uthaymeen (3/386-387)]</strong></span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46440">AbuDahlia</a> — Mon Jun 15, 2020 9:32 pm</p><hr />

The Prophet (Sallalāhū ʾAlayhī Wa Salam) said,<br /><br /><strong>&quot;You should definitely fast because there is no act similar to it.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Ibn Hibbān: 929, Hākim 1/421 and Albānī declared it Sahīh) </em><br /><br />It was narrated about Abu Bakr (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) that <strong>he used to perform optional fasts in the summer and not perform optional fasts in the winter. </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Maʾarif and Kitāb az-Zuhd of Ibn ul-Mubārak)</em><br /><br />Um ul-Muʾminīn ʿAʾisha (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnha) also <strong>used to perform optional fasts during severely hot weather. <br /></strong><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Maʾarif and Kitāb az-Zuhd of Ibn ul-Mubārak)</em><br /><br />ʿAbdullāh Bin ʿUmar (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) <strong>used to perform optional fasts. He used to faint and become unconscious due to the severity of the heat however he would still not break the fast. </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Maʾarif no.448) </em><br /><br />Imām Ahmād Bin Hanbal <strong>used to fast to the extent that he would faint because of the severity of the heat and someone would have to sprinkle water over his face. </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.448) </em><br /><br />Abū Ḍardā (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) said,<br /> <br /><strong>&quot;Fast on a day that is severely hot in order to be saved from the severe heat on the day of judgement. Perform 2 rakʿat of Salāh in the darkness of the night in order to obtain light in the darkness of the grave.&quot; <br /></strong><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.448) </em><br /><br />ʿAmir Bin Qays (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) came to an area of Shām from Basrāh. (During those days Muʿawiyah (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) was the Khalīfah and Shām was his area of Khilāfah). Muʿawiyah (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) said to him that if you have any needs then to please let me know. And he said this repeatedly. Each time ʿAmir Bin Qays (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) replied in the negative that he did not require anything. When Muʿawiyah (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū)insisted Amir Bin Qays (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) said, <br /><br /><strong>&quot;My need is that you bring me the heat of Basrāh, so that perhaps fasting becomes hard for me because fasting in your city is very light for me.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.447) </em><br /><br />Muʿadh Bin Jabal (Raḍī Allāhū ʾAnhū) was close to his death bed so he had a desire for something and said, <br /><br /><strong>&quot;I feel sad because the thirst from difficult fasting will now end.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Kitāb az-Zuhd of Ibn ul-Mubārak)</em><br /><br />When Ramadhān came Imām Shihābudīn Zuhrī said, <br /><br /><strong>&quot;This is the month of reciting the Qurʾān and providing food to eat.&quot; </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />Ibn ʿAbdul Hakam said about Imām Mālik Bin ʿAnas that <strong>when the month of Ramadhān came he would go away from the Majlis of Hadīth and the Majlis of the people of knowledge and would instead focus on opening the Qurʾān and look at it and recite it. </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />ʿAbdurazāq said, <br /><br /><strong>&quot;When the month of Ramadhān would come Imām Sufyān ath-Thawrī would leave off all talk and would focus on the Qurʾān.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />Ibn Rajab mentions that <strong>some of the Salaf would complete the Qurʾān in 3 nights during the month of Ramadhān...others would complete it in 7 days such as Qatādah and other than him...some other Salaf would complete the revision of the Qurʾān in 10 days and nights such as Abū Dujānah al-ʿAtarī and other than him. </strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />ʿAswad Bin Qays <strong>would complete the recitation of the Qurʾān once every 2 nights in the month of Ramadhān.</strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />Imām Nakhaī <strong>would complete the recitation of the Qurʾān once every 2 nights in the last 10 days of Ramadhān and he would complete the Qurʾān once every 3 days in the first 20 days of Ramadhān.</strong>  <br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />Imām Shaʾbi said,<br /><br /><strong>&quot;The night of Laylatul Qadr is like the day.&quot;</strong><br /> <br />Imām Shafʿī said, <br /><br /><strong>&quot;I like to make effort in worship during the day of Laylatul Qadr with the same amount of effort done during the night of Laylatul Qadr.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.245) </em><br /><br />Ibn Jarīr said, <br /><strong>&quot;I like to perform Ghusl on each night of the last days of Ramadhān.&quot;</strong><br /><br /><em>(Latāʾif ul-Ma`arif no.269) </em><br /> <br />Imām Nakhaī <strong>used to perform Ghusl on each night of the last 10 days of Ramadhān.

Words within arrows are the words from the article from islamqa, &gt;&gt;&gt;abc&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />In response to what we wrote regarding the alleged statement from Shaikh al-Albānī a brother posted an article from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://islamqa.info/en/102260">https://islamqa.info/en/102260</a><!-- m --> in response, showing the alleged view of the majority. we did not even talk about the intrinsic details of the issue of Isbāl or lowering the garments below the ankles.<br /><br />SubhānAllāh how strange and bizarre, our brother claimed he wanted to show the other opinion. Sure, but we did not even discuss the issue, we merely presented a very brief clarification of an alleged statement attributed to Shaikh al-Albānī.  I also asked our brother if he had read the article he posted and he said he did. Well if that is the case then the opening words were grossly overlooked and glossed over, which would have rendered his words, ‘other opinion’ to be null and void.<br /><br />What are we referring to? The contention was the allegation <br /><br />He was asked: Is is haram to have the clothes below their ankle for a man?<br />He replied: How can I make something Haram what the early scholars and four imams considered permissible?<br /><br />However, the opening words of the article showing this ‘other opinion’ said,<br /><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">&gt;&gt;&gt;Praise be to Allaah.<br /><br />If a man lets his garment hang down below the ankle with the intention of being conceited and showing off, this is HARAAM (emphasis mine) and there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that, rather it is a major sin. <br /><br />In the answer to question no. 762 we have quoted some of the ahaadeeth which speak of the prohibition on that.&lt;&lt;&lt; </span><br /><br />So there is NO scholarly difference of opinion that it is HARAM if a man lets his garment hang down below his ankle with the intention of being conceited and showing off. So the question is, the very same article they posted says its HARAM and for them to argue Shaikh al-Albānī was referring to the conceited or showing off type is in need of evidence and Hujjah, which they will never be able to provide.<br /><br />The article they posted goes onto say,<br /><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">&gt;&gt;&gt;With regard to the one who lets his garment hang below his ankle with no intention of being conceited and showing off, the scholars differed in this case and there are three points of view: that it is haraam, that it is makrooh and that it is permissible and not makrooh.&lt;&lt;&lt;</span><br /><br />The actual fatwa from the website no.762 they themselves refer to answers this claim itself, the claim that it is only makruh ie disliked if it the garment hangs down below the ankles due to arrogance, conceit and showing off. The article says the following, which is an answer to the information contained in the posted article.<br /><br />Unlike, the posted article which we don’t even know who wrote, the deductions are invalid as we do not even know how is making the ijtihad, whereas in our article we are clarifying without making a hukm, interestingly enough the article we have posted below is by Shaikh Muḥammad Ṣāleḥ al-Munajjad  <br /><br />It states,<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Assalamu Alaikum<br /><br />A brother was telling me that wearing clothing below the ankles is haram and that there are many hadiths that prove this. I would appreciate your opinion on this matter.<br /><br />Jazakallah<br />Published Date: 1998-04-18<br /><br />Praise be to Allaah.<br />What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing one’s clothes below the ankles), for example:<br /><br />Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, no. 5787)<br /><br />The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;There are three whom Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 106)<br /><br />The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Isbaal (wearing one’s garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&quot; (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaa’i, no. 5334, with a saheeh isnaad).<br /><br />Ibn ‘Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles.&quot; (Reported by al-Nisaa’i in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar).<br /><br />Hudhayfah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, ‘This is where the izaar should stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles.’&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783)<br /><br />All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is greater. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah will not look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788)<br /><br />Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: ‘Beware of wearing one’s lower garment below the ankles, because this is a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off.’&quot; (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2722).<br /><br />No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; Abu Bakr said to him, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it.&quot; He said: &quot;You are not one of those who do it out of pride.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784)<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The lower garment of the Muslim should come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.)</span><br /><br />These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different punishments:<br /><br />Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Ya’qoob said: &quot;I asked Abu Sa’eed: ‘Did you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)?’ he said, ‘Yes, listen! ‘The izaar of the believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire,’ and he said it three times.&quot;<br /><br />Ibn ‘Umar said: &quot;I passed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, ‘O ‘Abdullaah, pull up your izaar!’ so I pulled it up. He said, ‘More!’ so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up properly after that.&quot; Some people asked, &quot;To where did you pull it up?&quot; He said, &quot;To mid-calf length.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaa’ir, 131-132) <br /><br />The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him.’ Umm Salamah said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what should women do with their hems?’ He said, ‘Let them go down a handspan.’ She asked, ‘What if their feet show?’ He said, ‘Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more.’&quot; (al-Nisaa'i, Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa’).<br /><br />The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 2088).</strong><br /></div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Sep 13, 2017 5:58 pm</p><hr />

The following statement has been going around <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><em><strong>One of Shaykh Albani's friends from Jordan, who Shaykh Albani would often ask for advise: <br />He was asked: Is is haram to have the clothes below their ankle for a man?<br />He replied: How can I make something Haram what the early scholars and four imams considered permissible?<br /><br />- Shaykh Mohammad Ibn Mahmoud al-Selawi</strong></em><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />These points In shāʾ Allāh will bring further clarification to the statement above.<br /><br /><strong>No.1</strong><br />This friend is not maʿrūf, the general people do not know who he is, in comparison to the well known students and people who benefitted from Shaikh al-Albānī and they are known. In this regard we are unable to verify the reliability of this friend. When was this statement made, what year and where, and are there any other corroborating witnesses especially since it is disputable and contentious. If someone is going to be so brazen to make such statements or the one who then carelessly narrates it make a point, let us apply the principles of narrating to them. The reality is the madhabists want to take some credit from the great Shuyūkh in order to justify their viewpoints. Ya Akhī the obligation upon you are the divine texts and not the words of men! <br /><br /><strong>No.2</strong><br />None of the well known and famous students of Shaikh al-Albānī have transmitted this from him, such students are great in number, active in teaching and also authored hundreds of books and research based treatises between them; none of them have transmitted this. In fact one student has authored a specific book on the issue of the garments below the ankle and he does not cite this odd and aberrant view. From the numerous students of the Shaikh to our knowledge, not a single one of them has transmitted this from him, hence the alleged statement is to be rejected on the basis that it is Shadh and thus rejected.<br /><br /><strong>No.3</strong><br />We find the opposite from Shaikh al-Albānī and all the aḥadīth he authenticates which indicate the prohibition and forbiddance in letting the garment below the ankle, such ahadīth are so many that one could compile a whole book.<br /><br /><strong>No.4</strong><br />Shaikh al-Albānī has authored hundreds of books, some of which run into volumes and everyone knows the level of research, precision and meticulousness of the Shaikh, how he deals with issues and his clarification of them. From all of his works; which range from Aqīdah, Fiqh, Ḥadīth, the science of Ḥadīth, ʿUṣūl al-Fiqh we do not find a SINGLE statement even remotely suggesting the alleged statement above. <br /><br /><strong>No.5</strong><br />It is also known to the student of knowledge and even the beginner that Shaikh al-Albānī was a person of evidence and proof, he spent his whole life propagating an evidence approach to all matters, with the final resolve being the divine texts. It is therefore incredibly insensitive to say the least; to even suggest that he would hold the view of the four madhabs or Imāms as evidence. It is a totally different matter to even allege this was the view of the four Imāms and the early scholars. In fact it is outright ridiculous to suggest Shaikh al-Albānī would forsake the texts for the view of men. I mean look at his books, pick any one book and just read 2-3 pages and you will come to known the methodology of the Shaikh was to return to the texts. <br /><br /><strong>No.6</strong><br />Shaikh al-Albānī has in his various works opposed and went against the view of the earlier scholars, and there so many examples that it is bizarre and embarrassing that we have to even mention this. For example Shaikh al-Albānī goes against the authentication and disparagement of the earlier scholars on narrators and he has even discussed the narrators and narrations in Bukhārī and Muslim. He even opposed so many views of the Imāms and scholars of the past, why would it be different in this issue?<br /><br /><strong>No.7</strong><br />The wording is also suspect and this is an extension of the points above, because we know Shaikh al-Albānī's methodology was to refer to the nusus to make a ruling whether something was lawful, unlawful, prohibited, forbidden and or inherently disliked or the opposite and not look at the position or view of the the four madhabs. For instance one only has to read the introduction to the Ṣifah Ṣalāh to get a good idea that this alleged statement is questionable and perhaps a gross misunderstanding and or even idraj by the narrators and transmitter.<br /><br /><strong>No.8</strong><br />Shaikh al-Albānī has hundreds and hundreds of hours of recordings of his lessons, phone call conversations, questions and answer sessions, meetings, sermons etc. In fact he has the worlds best known series i.e. Silsilah Huda wan-Nūr as well as other series and we do not find a single statement from the Sheikhs own mouth in any of the hundreds of recordings, that he even said something remotely similar to the statement above. <br /><br /><strong>No.9</strong><br />Let us look at this is from another perspective, none of the numerous aḥadīth which discuss the issue of the garments below the ankle, mention the words ḥarām. There are so many narrations that the sheer number of them indicate and allude to prohibition i.e. being ḥarām. This is another discussion of ʿUṣūl al-Fiqh and what surprises us even more, the madhabist lovers under the garb and famous shield they use to hide behind of 'the four schools of thought' know very well because they engross themselves in ʿUṣūl al-Fiqh know that certain words indicate Nahi i.e. prohibition, words that indicate punishment are prohibited etc and on the other end their is Amr to raise the garment and again Amr is is for wujūb, yet they still have the mind boggling audacity to narrate and transmit such high suspect allegations.<br /><br /><strong>No.10</strong><br />The threat to punish those who drag their garments below the ankles is clear. the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <em>&quot;The part of the Izār which hangs below the ankles is in the fire.&quot;</em> (Bukhārī no.678). the garments below the ankles are a violation of this command. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr hols the literal meaning of this ḥadīth to be true i.e. the clothes below the ankle will be in the fire and he quotes the āyah Sūrah al-Anbiyā (21:98, See Fatḥ al-Bārī (10:268 no.5789)<br /><br /><strong>No.11</strong><br />In fact, the majority of the scholars i.e. the jumhūr agree that when the text is in the imperative form, it is intended for Taḥrīm (i.e. making something harām or unlawful), unless there is another authentic evidence that indicates otherwise. In one incident the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw someone dragging his lower garment. he ﷺ rushed to him and said, <em>&quot;<strong>Pull up</strong> your Izār and fear Allāh,&quot; The man said, &quot;I am Ahnāf (distortion of the foot which move towards each other) a person with trembling knees,&quot; He ﷺ said, &quot;<strong>Tug up</strong> your Izār, certainly all of Allāh's creation is good.&quot; Since then the man was not seen except with his Izār touching the middle of his Shins or up to the middle of his Shins.&quot;</em> (Ahmad on the condtions of Bukhārī and Muslim, refer to Silsilah āḥadīth al-Ṣaḥīḥaḥ (no.1441). There are many other āḥadīth which clearly command and are thus are the imperative form. Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr said about some of these āḥadīth that the apparent meaning of the ḥadīth indicates that it is <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong>.&quot; (Fatḥ al-Bārī (10:263)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Sep 12, 2017 11:40 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Neglecting Prayer Out Of Laziness</span></strong><br /><br />Imaam Ahmad said that the one who does not pray because of laziness is a kaafir. This is the more correct view and is that indicated by the evidence of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and by the words of the Salaf and the proper understanding. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustanqi’, 2/26).</span></strong><br /><br />Among the evidence to be found in the Qur’aan is:<br /><br />“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allaah and His Messenger Muhammad), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.” <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Maryam 19:59-60]</span></strong><br /><br />The evidence of the Sunnah that proves that the one who neglects the prayer is a kaafir includes the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his neglect of the prayer.” <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(Narrated by Muslim in Kitaab al-Eemaan from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)).</span></strong><br /><br />It was narrated that Buraydah ibn al-Husayb (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The covenant that distinguishes between us and them is the prayer, and whoever neglects it has disbelieved (become a kaafir).’” <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(It was narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa’i and Ibn Maajah). </span></strong><br /><br />‘Abd-Allaah ibn Shaqeeq said: the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not think that neglecting any deed made a person a kaafir, apart from neglecting the prayer. This was reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh according to the conditions of <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(al-Bukhaari and Muslim).</span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Jul 30, 2017 12:37 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Correct Way To Recite In Your Prayers (Salah) And In Morning – Evening Supplications<br /></span></strong><br /><em>By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool <br />Translated &amp; Foreword by Umm Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Foreword:</span></strong><br /><br />Are you saying your morning and evening Dua’ yet being afflicted by trials? This concise article may shed light on some questions.<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool says speaking about the correct way in which one should recite silently:<br /><br />‘Once one is a aware concerning the conditions of reciting audibly and silently, the way in which some people pray with their lips closed and not moving their tongue until they complete their prayer. They do not move their tongues to recite whilst standing in their prayer. Yet they are meant to be reciting but yet they do not move their tongues in remembrance, nor whilst in Ruku (bowing) or while standing up from it, nor in Sajood(prostration) or as they come up from Sajood or while they sit in the Tashahood(sitting at the end of the prayer).<br /><br />So we say that those people who pray like this, in fact their prayer is nullified because they have not recited in their prayer.<br /><br />This is because the tongue must move in recitation, and according to some of the Scholars (Fuqaha) it is necessary to move the tongue in the silent prayers and you must be able to hear yourself. And this matter is of utmost importance. Many people say: ‘I say my morning and evening supplications regularly and we seek refuge in Allaah yet we still experience afflictions.’ So we say if you recite the morning and evening supplications then it is necessary to move the tongue while reciting them, there is no benefit if you pass your eyes along the lines of the page and to say that this is a silent reading. This is not considered reading or speech in the Arabic tongue. Reading in the Arabic language necessitates movement of the tongue, as is known from the hadeeth which is narrated from the Companions -may Allaah be pleased with them- that they knew when the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was reciting silently due to the movement of his beard. This illustrates that the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- whilst reciting silently would move his lips and tongue.  This moving of the tongue is if the person has the capability to move his tongue and that there is nothing to hinder the movement of the tongue.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Sharh Sifat Sallat an-Nabi –-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-‘ by Muhammad Bazmool, p.221]</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 1:16 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Stoning To Death?</span></strong><br /><br />a). Sahih Bukhari<br /><br />Bukhari Volume 7, Book 63, Number 195:<br />Narrated Jabir:<br /><br />A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam(Maa’iz) came to the Prophet while he was in the mosque and said, &quot;I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.&quot; The Prophet turned his face to the other side. The man turned towards the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and gave four witnesses against himself. On that the Prophet called him and said, &quot;Are you insane?&quot; (He added), &quot;Are you married?&quot; The man said, 'Yes.&quot; On that the Prophet ordered him to be stoned to the death in the Musalla (a praying place). When the stones hit him with their sharp edges and he fled, but he was caught at Al-Harra and then killed<br /><br />b) Sahih Muslim<br /><br />In Saheeh Muslim Sahaba says &quot;We took him(Maa`iz) to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him.&quot; <em>[Sahih Muslim Book #017, Hadith #4202]</em><br /><br />c). Abu Dawud<br /><br />Another Hadith says &quot;They then went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and reported it(His running while stoning) to him. He said: Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah.<em>(Abu Dawud Book #38, Hadith #4405 Authenticated by Shaykh Al Bani, al-Hafiz Ibne Hajar Asqalani, al-Hakim,Dahabee see detail in the book &quot;Erwa al Ghulail hadith no: 2322 Vol 7 page 358).</em><br /><br />d) Jabir bin Abdullah ra said<br />Prophet peace be upon him said: Why did you not leave him alone and bring him to me? and he said this so that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) might ascertain it from him. But he did not say this to abandon the prescribed punishment.<em>[Abu Dawud Book# 38 hadith# 4406]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Commentaries.</span></strong><br /><br />a) Imam An Nawawi said<br />Imam Ash Shafiee and Ahmad and Others says that If he is agreeing that he did zina(after marriage) and if he is running while stoning, immediately he should be left alone..., Malik says in one of the narration that he should not be left alone and should be killed, Imam Ash Shafiee made the evidence from the narration of Sunan Abu Dawood where Prophet peace be uponhim said &quot;Why did you not leave him alone until Allah look into him &quot; and the narrations &quot;&quot;Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah&quot;<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Sharah an Nawawy, Book of Hudood Chapter on HE WHO CONFESSES HIS GUILT OF ADULTERY]</span></strong><br /><br />b) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:<br />It may be understood from this case – the case of Maa’iz when he confessed to having committed zina – that it is mustahabb for the one who falls into a similar sin to repent to Allaah and conceal his sin and not mention it to anyone, as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar said to Maa’iz. Whoever discovers anything of that nature should conceal it according to what we have mentioned; he should not expose it or refer the matter to the ruler, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in this story: “If you had concealed it with your garment it would have been better for you.” Hence al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If a person commits a sin and Allaah conceals it for him, I prefer for him to conceal it too and to repent,” and he quoted as evidence the story of Maa’iz with Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Fath al-Baari, 12/124, 125]</span></strong><br /><br />c) Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Raz mentioned<br />Another hadith says when Prophet peace be upon him heard that he ran away, he(peace be upon him) said &quot;Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah&quot;. This is the saying of Imam Shafiee and Ahlul hadeeth that If he is agreeing that he did zina(after marriage) and if he is running while stoning, immediately he should be left alone <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Commentary of Sahih Bukhari by Muhammad Dawud Raz checked by Shaykh Abds Salam Bastawi and Shaykh Abdul Jabbar Salafi Vol 7 page 51]</span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 1:04 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Not Raising the Hands to Supplicate After the Obligatory Prayer</span></strong><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /> <br />‘The people of knowledge explained that it is not legislated to raise the hands in Dua’ after completing the obligatory prayer, and that it opposes the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.<br /> <br />Ibn al-Haaj -Rahimullaah- said:<br />‘It has not been mentioned that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had completed the prayer and given Tasleem, that he raised his hands and supplicated, and that the people said Ameen to his Dua’. Nor was it mentioned regarding the Khulafah Rashideen after the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor from the rest of the Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum. Therefore, something which the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did not do, nor any one of his Companions then there is no doubt that leaving that action is better than doing it, rather this action is a Bida’. . . .’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[al-Mudkhal 2/276]</span></strong> <br />  <br />It has been mentioned in the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Fatawa of the Lajnah ad-Daimah for research of knowledge and verdicts’</span></strong>:<br />‘Making Dua’ after the obligatory prayer is not from the Sunnah if it is done while raising the hands. This is whether it is done by the Imam alone or just those who had prayed behind him, or the Imam and the people together. Rather this is a Bida’, because it has not been conveyed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- nor from his Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum-.<br /> <br />As for Dua’ without raising the hands, then that is okay due to some Ahadeeth mentioned regarding that.’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[‘Fatawa Lajnah’ 7/103]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz -Rahimullaah- said: ‘As far as we know it has not been reported from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- nor from his Companions -Radi Allaahu anhum- that they used to raise their hands to make Dua’ after the obligatory prayer. So it is known to be a Bida’ due to the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:<br /> <br />‘He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected.’ Collected by Muslim in his Saheeh.<br /> <br />As for making Dua’ without raising the hands and without doing it in congregation then there is no problem with doing that, because what has been affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that which indicates that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- supplicated before the Salam [at the end of the prayer] and after it.<br /> <br />Similar to this is making Dua’ after the optional prayer, due to the absence of any indication that it is allowed –regardless of whether or not the hands are raised, as raising the hands in Dua’ is a means for that Dua’ being answered. However, this should not be done regularly, rather from time to time, because it is not affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to make Dua’ raising his hands after every optional prayer. All good is in taking the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- as an example and following his methodology due to the saying of Allaah –Subhanahu:<br /> <br />&quot;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow&quot;  <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqalaat Mutnawa’ah (11/168)]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- said: ‘It is not affirmed from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he used to raise his hands after the prayer if he made Dua’. . . .’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Silsilah Ahadeeth Da’eefah wal Mawdoo’ah 6/60]</span></strong><br /> <br />Shaykh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.) said: ‘My instruction to the one who supplicates to Allaah Ta’ala after every obligatory prayer while raising his hands, is to leave that practice and to follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and to adhere to his guidance. Indeed the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.’ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Majmoo Fatawa wa Ras’ail 13/281]</span></strong><br /> <br />[From: ‘al-Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah wal-Mawdoo’ah alati Yastadil biha ala Bida’ fel Ibadaat’ 1/450]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 12:51 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Manner In Wiping Over The Head During Wudhoo’ For The Women: </span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Is it prescribed for a woman, when wiping over the head during Wudhoo’, to begin from the front of the head and the go towards the back, and then finally to come back to the front, as is prescribed for a man? <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> Yes, this is the case because concerning Islaamic rulings, whatever is established for men is also established for women and vice versa, except if there is a specific proof that shows that a ruling only applies to men and not women or vice versa. In this issue, I do not know of any proof that is specific to women only. Thus, she should also, like a man, wipe over the head from the front to the back. If the hair is long, it will not be affected by this, since the purpose is not to press hard on the hair till they become soaked or to reach the scalp; rather the wiping should be done with calmness and tranquillity. <br /><br /><em>Fatwa Essential Rulings For Every Muslim Women By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn al-`Uthaymeen pg. 65</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2017 12:48 am</p><hr />
