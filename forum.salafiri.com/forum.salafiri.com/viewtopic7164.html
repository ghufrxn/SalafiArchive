Rather Aboo Sulaymaan is a Shaikh from our Shaikhs, and a teacher from our teachers. If he attained correctness, then we are along with him, following the truth; and if he made a mistake, then we excuse ourselves, and we follow the truth, wherever we understand it to be.&quot;</em><br /><br />[Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah]<br /><br />Source: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com/">www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a><!-- w --></div>
