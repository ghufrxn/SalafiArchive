<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Definition of Dalaal</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Saalih al Fawzaan</em><br /><br />Taken from: Aqeedatut Tawheed of Shaykh Saalih al Fawzaan, page 114-115<br />Translator Nasser ibn Najam – words in brackets and footnotes are the translator’s<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Meaning:</span></strong> <br /><br />Turning away from the Straight Path and it is the opposite of guidance.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Explanation:</span></strong><br /><br />Ad dalaal (going astray) is turning away from the Straight Path and it is the opposite of guidance. He, the Most High, said:<br /><br /><ul>Whoever goes right by being upright and established upon the Path of Truth, then he goes aright only for the benefit of his own self.<br /><br />And whoever dalla (goes astray) so he takes hold of other than guidance, disbelieving in Allaah and in Muhammad (sall Allaahu‘alaihi wa sallam) and in the Truth which he came with from his Lord, then he does not harm anyone other than himself by his deviation and straying from guidance.[1]<br />[Soorah al Israa-(17) aayah 15]</ul><br />And <em>ad-dalaal</em> is applied to a number of (different) meanings:<br /><br />i) Sometimes it is applied to disbelief; He, the Most High, said:<br /><ul>And whoever disbelieves in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day, then he has indeed gone astray with a far dalaal (misguidance). [Soorah an Nisaa- (4)aayah 136]</ul><br />ii) And sometimes it is applied to shirk (associating partners with Allaah). He, the Most High, said:<br /><ul>And whoever commits shirk with Allaah, then he has indeed strayed with a far dalaal. [Soorah an Nisaa- (4)aayah 116]</ul><br />iii) And sometimes it is applied to opposition (to the Truth) which is lesser than disbelief, such as (when) it said: al firaq ud daalat (the sects of misguidance) – meaning (the sects of) opposition.<br /><br />iv) And sometimes it is applied to error[2], and from it is the statement of Moosaa ‘alaihissalaam:<br /><ul>I did it then when I was from the daaleen. [Soorah ash Shu’araa-(26) aayah 20]</ul><br />v) And sometimes it is applied to forgetfulness, and from it is His statement, He, the Most High:<br /><ul>So that if one of them tadilla (forgets)[3], then the other can remind her… [Soorah al Baqarah (2)aayah 282]</ul><br />vi) And ad dalaal is applied to being lost and absent, and from it is daalat ul ibil (stray camels).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br />[1] Refer to Tafseer at Tabaree<br /><br />[2] Refer to the narration of ibn Zayd in explanation of Soorah 26 aayah 20,reported in Tafseer at Tabaree<br /><br />[3] Refer to the narration of ar Rabee’, ad Dahhaak and others as reported in Tafseer at Tabaree<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 21, 2017 11:46 pm</p><hr />
