Thus the thing that is waahid (“one”) is separate and alone – the one for which nothing other than it is a partner to it.<br /><br />As for in the Legislation, then tawheed is: “The singling out of Allaah in [all] worship”, with the meaning that all worship is made solely for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.<br /><br /><ul>“And the religion – the obedience and the worship - is for Allaah, purely and sincerely, to exclusion of anyone other than Him.” [1]</ul><em>Sooratul Anfaal (8) aayah 39</em><br /><br />And with the proof as His saying, He the Most High:<br /><ul>“And I did not create the jinn or mankind except to worship Me alone.”</ul><em>Soorah Dhaariyaat (51) aayah 56</em><br /><br />And His saying, He the Most High:<br /><ul>“And worship Allaah alone; and do not set up any partner with Him in His Lordship nor in worship of Him, glorifying it as you would glorify Him.” [2]</ul><em>Sooratun Nisaa (4) aayah 36</em><br /><br /><br />And His saying:<br /><ul>“So call upon Allaah, making the Religion purely and sincerely for Him, not being people who associate anything other than Him as a partner in obedience to Him – even if the disbelievers detest your worship of Him.” [3]</ul><em>Soorah Ghaafir (40) aayah 14</em><br /><br />This is [meaning of] tawheed in the Legislation: the singling out of Allaah in [all] worship and abandoning the worship of whatever is besides Him.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br /><br />[1] Tafseer of at-Tabaree<br />[2] Tafseer of at-Tabaree<br />[3] Tafseer of at-Tabaree</div>
