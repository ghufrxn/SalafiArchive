<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Report of Safiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha saying Yā RasūlAllāh in a Poem]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=225&amp;p=234#p234"><![CDATA[
a report or incident is often cited concerning Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha where she recited a poem after the demise of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and a couplet of that poem which Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha allegedly recited included the words, &quot;Oh (Yā) RasūlAllāh you are our reference of hope.&quot;<br /><br />So the Barailwī Sūfī ʿAshaʿrī contingency claim Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha recited the poem after the demise of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and therefore saying Yā RasūlAllāh and referring to the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) for hope as a means of help and assistance is permissible.<br /><br />However the chain of this report is disconnected as it contains ʿUrwah bin Zubair who was born in the year 29H and Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha recited the poem immediately after the demise of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) when he died in 11H which means ʿUrwah was born approximately 18-19 years after the demise of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and thus the chain of this poem is weak as ʿUrwah did not meet his grandmother Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha !!!<br /><br />Furthermore, Ṣafiyyah RaḍiAllāhu Anha died in 20H i.e. 9 years before the birth of ʿUrwah ibn Zubair and therefore there is a disconnection between them which renders the narration, leading to the poem to be weak.<br /><br />The general meaning of the couplet under discussion is also questionable due to the fundamental teachings of Islam and therefore both elements - the text and chain are highly questionable.<br /><br />another point to consider, the poems and couplets that were recited after the demise of the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) that have reached us via authentic and sound chains, then none of them contain the words, Yā RasulAllāh!!!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Fri Sep 02, 2016 12:58 am</p><hr />
