				<div class="content">Even Salafees Do Taqleed<br /><br />This is old speech from some of the People of Innovation (Ahlul Bid’ah). The famous Ahlul Hadeeth scholar, as-San’aanee has mentioned in his book Irshaadun-Nuqqad Ilaa-Ijtihaad from some of the People of Innovation who said “You forbid from blind following and yet you blind follow Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, so if Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een says about a man, ‘He is trustworthy’, you’ll say, ‘Trustworthy’, and if al-Bukhaaree says, ‘This hadeeth is authentic’, you’ll say, ‘It is authentic’. So you are blind followers!”<br /><br />So as-San’aanee answered this in his tremendous book Irshaadun-Nuqqad Ilaa-Ijtihaad.<br /><br />He said “Indeed this is not blind following, rather it is only the acceptance of the narration of the trustworthy, and Allah says in his noble book, ‘O you who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with news, verify it. Lest you should harm a people out of ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.’ [Soorahtul-Hujuraat 49:6]. So this ayah is understood that if a trustworthy person comes to us, we accept his information.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/salafees-taqleed/">http://www.salafiri.com/salafees-taqleed/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.</div>
