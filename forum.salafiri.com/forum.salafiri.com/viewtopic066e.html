The Sunnah to us is, for one to believe in predestination, the good of it and bad, the delightful of it and the bitter, and that he should know that what he has befallen him did not wrongly befall him, and that what has not happened to him was not wrongly so, and that all of that is the predestination of Allaah, `azza wa jall.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF40">Belief is statements and actions, it increases and decreases</span><br /><br />2. And that Eman is statements and actions, it increases and decreases, and no statement is sufficient except with actions, and no statement and action without Niyyah (4), and no statement, action and Niyyah without it being a Sunnah.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF40">Praise upon the Sahaabah, May Allaah be pleased with them</span><br /><br />3. And asking for mercy upon all of the companions of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, for indeed Allaah, `azza wa jall, said,<br /><br />{And those who came after them say: &quot;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith… [59:10]<br /><br />So one does not believe except after asking for forgiveness for them, and whoever curses them or belittles them then he is not on the Sunnah, and he has no rights to booty, more than one informed us from Maalik bin Anas, that he said, &quot;Allaah, ta`alaa, divided the group and said,<br /><br />{(And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes} [59:8]<br /><br />And then He also said,<br /><br />{And those who came after them say: &quot;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith… [59:10]<br /><br />So whoever does not say that then he is not from those whom the booty is given to.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF40">The Qur'an is the speech of Allaah</span><br /><br />4. And [regarding] the Qur'an: it is the speech of Allaah, I heard Sufyaan bin `Uyainah say, &quot;The Qur'an is the speech of Allaah, and whoever says that it is created is a Mubtadi` (5), we do not listen to anyone who says that.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF40">Sufyaan's statements concerning Eman</span><br /><br />And I heard Sufyaan say, &quot;Eman is statements and actions, it increases and decreases.&quot; So his brother said to him, &quot;O Abu Muhammad, do not say that it decreases&quot;, so he responded, &quot;Be quiet O lad! Rather, it decreases to the point where nothing of it remains!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF40">The believers' seeing of their Lord after death</span><br /><br />5. And affirming seeing Allaah after the death.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF00">Affirming the Sifaat (attributes)</span><br /><br />6. And that which the Qur'an and Hadeeth have spoken about, such as,<br /><br />{The Jews say: &quot;Allâh's Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).&quot; Be their hands tied up…} [5:64]<br /><br />As well as,<br /><br />{And the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand} [39:67]<br /><br />And the Qur'an nor the Sunnah gave likening to this, we do not increase in it, nor do we explain it, we stop where the Qur'an and Sunnah stop, and we say,<br /><br />{The Most Gracious (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).} [20:5]<br /><br />And whoever assumes other than this then he is a Mu`attal (6) and a Jahmi (7).<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #00BF00">The difference between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Khawaarij</span><br /><br />7. And that we do not say as the Khawaarij said, &quot;Whoever does a Kabeerah (8) has done an action of infidelity&quot;. And there is no Takfeer (9) of anyone who performs a sin, rather, Takfeer is performed on the one who leaves any of the five that Messenger of Allaah spoke about, &quot;Islaam was built upon five [pillars, (as they are commonly referred to)], Testimony that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, peace and blessings be upon him, and offering the Salat (10), and giving charity, and fasting Ramadhaan, and making Hajj (11) to the house (12) .&quot;<br /><br />[Muslim, 19; Ibn Hibbaan, 1446, as well as others]<br /><br /><br />When is the proofs established against the one who leaves one of the pillars of Islaam, or some of them?<br /><br />As for three of them, then there is no debate regarding the one who leaves it: The one who does not utter, &quot;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah&quot;, and the one who does not pray, and the one who does not fast because he is delaying one of those from its due time, and it does not replace the one who complied after negligence of it knowingly, from its time.<br /><br />    As for the charity, when he does not give it, it can be replaced, and he is sinful by not giving it.<br /><br />    And as for the Hajj, then whoever it is obligated on, and he finds a means to do it then it is obligatory upon him, and it is not obligated upon him in that year so that there will not be because of it a doubt of when he did it, that he did it. And he is not sinful if he delays it as he is sinful when he delays the Zakaat (13), because the Zakaat is a right for the poor Muslims, his donation is on them, if he gives then he has given. If he dies sorry and able, but did not perform pilgrimage he asks to be returned to this Dunya to make Hajj, and it is obligatory upon his family to perform it for him, and we ask that, that is accepted as an action that he did, just as he had a religion and all the people came [to pray] on him after his death.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Footnotes:</span><br /><br />    Not the same al-Musnad of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal<br />    These two Imaams, Abu Haatim and Abu Zur`ah, are commonly referred to as, 'ar-Raaziyyaan', or, 'The Two Raazis'<br />    Thiqah means Trustworthy<br />    Intention<br />    Heretic; Innovator;<br />    Those that invalidate the meanings of Allaah's attributes<br />    Those that deny all of Allaah's attributes, as well as say the Qur'an is created<br />    Major sin<br />    Charging of infidelity<br />    Prayer<br />    Pilgrimage<br />    i.e., the Ka`bah, in the city of Makkah<br />    Charity<br /><br />End of the letter<br /><br />And all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of all that Exists<br /><br /><em><strong>Translated by Amr bin Jalal Abualrub</strong></em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/the-fundamentals-of-the-sunnah-imaam-abu-bakr-abdullaah-bin-az-zubair-al-humaidee/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2007 ... -humaidee/</a><!-- m --></div>
