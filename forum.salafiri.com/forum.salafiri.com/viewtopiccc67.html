When you are with your sheep in your wilderness, and you recite the Adhan for your prayers, raise your voice, for no jinn or man or anything within the voice range of the Mu'adhin (caller to Prayer) hears the call, but will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;</span></em>  Abu Sa`id said, I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). This Hadith is related by Imam Ahmad and Al-Bukhari.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta'</span></strong><br /><br /><ul><em>Member - `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud<br />Chairman - `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</em></ul><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;BookID=7&amp;PageID=1830&amp;back=true">http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChap ... &amp;back=true</a><!-- m --></div>
