			<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Imaam Muqbil on Jarh, Accepting News, Warning from the Hizbees and Taqleed</span></strong> [1]<br /><br /><em>Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi’ee<br /><br />Translated by Abul-Hasan Malik al-Akhdar</em><br /><br />Questions and Answers with our Sheikh Muqbil bin Haadee on those who say: That the speech of the Scholars about the people of innovation is backbiting and envy, and accepting it is blind following by Our Sheikh, The Muhaddith of the lands of Yemen, Imaam, Aboo ’Abdur-Rahmaan Muqbil Ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, and it consists of three questions that were chosen from the questions of the Salafee brothers in the city of As-Sumu’ahin the district of al-Baydaa and they are the last questions that the Shaykh answered, may Allaah have mercy upon him, on his chair in Daarul-Hadeeth in Dammaaj, may Allaah protect it from every evil and hated thing, and it was on Saturday night the 8th day of Rabee’ul-Awwal 1421H. We ask Allaah to benefit by it the Islaam and the Muslims, and to protect the Ummah and to preserve its ’Ulamaa‘ and to grant them success in that which He loves and is pleased with.<br /><br />[1] First Question: The questioner asks, “There are those who say that accepting the statements of the scholars about the people is considered blind following so what is the validity of this statement?”<br /><br />All praise is due to Allaah and the prayers and peace be upon our Messenger Muhammad and upon his family and Companions and those who adhere, I testify that nothing has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone and He has no partners and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. To proceed:<br /><br />This is old speech from some of the people of innovation, As-San’aanee has mentioned in his book Irshaadun-Nuqqaad Ilaa Tayseeril-Ijtihaad from some of the people of innovation who said, ‘You forbid from blind following and yet you blind follow Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, so if Yahyaa says about a man, ‘He is trustworthy,’ you’ll say, ‘Trustworthy’ and if al-Bukhaaree says, ‘This hadeeth is authentic,’ you’ll say: ‘It is authentic,’ so you are blind followers. So as-San’aanee answered this in his tremendous book Irshaadun-Nuqqaad Ilaa Tayseeril-Ijtihaad.<br /><br />He said, ‘Indeed this is not blind following rather it is only the acceptance of the narration of trustworthy, and Allaah says in His Noble Book, ‘O you who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with news verify it, lest you should harm a people out of ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.’ [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:6] So this verse is understood that if a trustworthy person comes to us we accept his information.’<br /><br />Yes if a weak person speaks about an Imaam from the Imaams then they do not accept his speech, Imaam adh-Dhahabee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, after mentioning the criticism of al-’Uqaylee about ’Alee Ibnul-Madeenee, ’Abdur-Razzaaq, and a group of the Scholars, adh-Dhahabee refuted him saying, ‘Do you have any sense O ’Uqaylee! You come to the great Scholars of Islaam and speak against them while they are better than you,’ or with this meaning. So if a weak person speaks about an Imaam from the great imaams his speech is not accepted, an example of that is the speech of al-Qardaawee about ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz that ’Abdul-Majeed ar-Raymee read in Jaami’ud-Da’wah, Jaami’ud-Da’wah that spread from it Sunan until it fell into the hands of ’Abdul-Majeed ar-Raymee and he infected it, ’Abdul-Majeed read the statement of al-Qardaawee supporting it, and some from the ignorant Yemenis who listened to him left out and were cursing ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz. I was informed of this by the trustworthy brother ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ’Iyaash so if one of no standing like ’Abdul-Majeed ar-Raymee or Yoosuf al-Qardaawee comes and defames an Imaam from the Imaams of the Muslims we do not accept it whatsoever. Yes and also the words of al-Haafidh adh-Dhahabee: ‘Abul-Fath al-Azdee, Muhammad Ibnul-Husayn comes and declares some of the Imaams to be weak, so Imaam adh-Dhahabee says, ‘This one is an Imaam and Abul-Fath al-Azdee is weak.’ So what? What is important is that al-Jarh wat-Ta’deel is not an affair of blind following, unless one who is weak defames an Imaam from the Imaams like what was done by Zaahid al-Kawtharee, may Allaah not reward him with good, he defamed al-Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, al-Bukhaaree, Ibn Hibbaan, ad-Daaraqutnee, and so on all the way until his time, the defamation of the likes of this weak one are not even considered,<br /><br />‘The overflowing ocean is not harmed; If a fool throws a stone in it.’<br /><br />So the defamation of this ignoble Muhammad Zaahid al-Kawtharee will not harm them. As for our Imaams and those who speak against the people of innovation then our Lord says in His Noble Book what you heard in the verse, ‘If a wicked person comes to you with news verify it.’ So what is understood from it is that if a trustworthy person comes to us we accept his information. And Muslim narrates in his Saheeh on the authority of Tameem ad-Daaree, may Allaah be pleased with him who said that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘The Religion is sincere advice.’ And in the Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Bajalee that he said, ‘We pledged allegiance to the Messenger of Allaah to establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaah, and to give sincere advice to every Muslim. O brothers! These people will resist with anything they can. Look at the cassette that ’Abdul-Majeed az-Zindaanee about the Majlis ush-Shaykhaat (Committee of Female Scholars) in Yemen, like in the disbelieving countries he mentioned this and some said, ‘By Allaah this speech is not good but is it the voice of ’Abdul-Majeed. O brothers! Listen! Listen! May Allaah bless you, so that you will not be saddened from this obstinance. Allah says about these obstinant ones,<br /><br />“And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep ascending thereto (all the day long). They would surely say (in the evening): ‘Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled. Nay we are a people bewitched.” [Sooratul-Hijr 14]<br /><br />O brothers! We can do nothing for the one who is obstinate. You might say daraba (past tense verb meaning he struck or hit) is a past tense verb and he will say, ‘No it isn’t, it is imperative. Who said it was a past tense verb? Or you say to him the Sun rose from over here. He says: No it didn’t it was from the West. You can’t see. So inform them that we can’t do anything for them, but we have for them the Book of our Lord and the Sunnah of our Prophet, and if only they would return and repent to Allaah. Wallaahul-Musta’aan.”<br /><br />[2] Fourth Question: The questioner asks, “O Shaykh there are some who consider the the speech of the Salafee Scholars against the hizbees (bigoted partisans) as jealousy between the scholars. So what is your reply to that? “What are we jealous of? Their masjids used to be filled with their students but when they smelled the odour of hizbiyyah [they left] and so they remained alone in their masaajid. So what are they jealous of? Do we envy them for wordly gains? We have left it (the worldly gain) praise be to Allaah, and we praise Allaah Who has given us success and made our hearts content from worldly affairs, and the Prophet spoke the truth when he said as has come in the hadeeth of Aboo Sa’eed al-Khudree in the Saheehayn, “Whoever seeks understanding Allaah will give it to him, and whoever is content Allaah will enrich him, and no one was given a provision better and more expansive than patience.” So I don’t what they have to be jealous of. Rather, we hope that they will return to the Sunnah, this is what we hope.”<br /><br />[3] Tenth Question: The questioner asks: O noble Shaykh! There are those that say that the speech against the Hizbees (bigoted partisans), and warning against them is considered backbiting so what do you say in this?<br /><br />O brothers! I have become tired, and have answered this question many times, and I answered it previously in on this cassette that the Prophet said, “The Religion is sincere advice.” So the Messenger according to their madhhab backbites the people, but some of the people don’t understand, it is true that some from the common folk don’t understand, by Allaah this is true. So listen, may Allaah bless you, the Messenger said said, “Are you a Fattaan O Mu’aadh?” And he said about the Khawaarij, “They will leave the Religion as the arrow passes through the game animal.” And he said about the Khawaarij, “They are the dogs of the inhabitants of the Hellfire.” And he said about the one who sought to enter upon him, “What an evil member of his tribe.” And he said to Aboo Dharr, “You are a man who has in him al-Jaahiliyyah.” And also he said to his women, “Indeed, you are like the women of Yoosuf.”<br /><br />This is the speech of those who don’t know O brothers, may Allaah bless you. Yes the Messenger of Allaah said, “The Religion is sincere advice.” And Allaah says, “So that there will be from you an Ummah that calls to good and enjoins the good and forbids the evil and they are the successful.” And the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘Whoever from you that sees an evil let him change it with his hand and if he is unable then with his tongue and if he is unable then let him hate it in his heart and this is the weakest of faith.’ So praise be to Allaah we mentioned a good number [of proofs] in the introduction of al-Makhraj.<br /><br />Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee backbites the people, why? Because he said, “Narrating on Haraam Ibn ’Uthmaan is Haraam (unlawful).” Ash-Shafi’ee is far from backbiting except in the madhhab of these ignorant ones. And also some Soofies came to Imaam Ahmad and said to him, “You back bite the people.” He said, “No, rather if I remain quiet and so-and-so remained quiet, then who would clarify for the people.” So it is a must to clarify and stand against the hizbees. Yes, why criticize us and Sa’tar, may Allaah not bless him said: we work for America. And he said: we are the brothers of the communists, and the tapes are present with us. Like this they have slandered us and cursed us unjustly! Allaah says,<br /><br />“There is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders charity, goodness, or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, seeking the good pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a great reward.” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:114]<br /><br />We wish we could be quiet but it is not possible for us to be quiet, and we know if we were to be quiet that the Ikhwaanee, the one from Jam’iyyatul-Hikmah, Jam’iyyatul-Ihsaan, also the securalist, and other than them perhaps would label us Shaykhul-Islaam, but we cannot be quiet even if they say what they say, and praise be to Allaah we are not concerned with them and their speech, we know that we have faults and that we are not infallible, and we also know that we are upon firmness in our Religion may Allaah give you all success in that which he loves and is pleased with and all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br /><br />[1] This information was taken from SalafiTalk.Net, reproduced here with permission.
