And they would not accept any advice, they would continue upon these aspects of Shirk! You would see it written in their shops and their Masajid: ‘Ya Allaah, Ya Ali, Ya Ghawth, Ya Hussain, Ya AbdulQadir, Ya such and such!!’ as well as other aspects of Shirk!<br /><br />Seeking aid from other than Allaah is Shirk; by saying ‘Ya Muhammad’, then this is committing Shirk with Allaah (associating partners to Allaah). Muhammad was the Messenger of Allaah, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam. Therefore, if one says ‘Ya Allaah and Ya Muhammad’, then that person has made Muhammad as an equal to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala.<br /><br />The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- did not come except to destroy this polytheism, and to rectify the deviated nation and at the head of what they had was committing Shirk (associating) with Allaah -Azza wa Jal. The Messenger came to purify the Dunyaa, the hearts, the minds and intellects from Shirk with Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and the filth connected with Shirk.<br /><br />He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- taught us pure Tawheed with the texts of the Qur’aan, the texts of the Sunnah and practically implementing them. He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- ordered us to level the graves, and to destroy idols.<br /><br />The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- said:<br /><br />‘Do not undertake journeys except to three Masajid – only these, not to graves, nor any place [for worship] – the Masjid al-Haraam, and this masjid of mine, and Masjid al-Aqsa.’<br /><br />This is because these Masajid were built by the Prophets for the Tawheed of Allaah having Ikhlaas (Sincerity) of the Deen for Allaah – Azza wa Jal.<br /><br />This action of writing ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ began in al-Madinah – since we know these things we can evaluate it – we knew the plots of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.<br /><br />There was a man named Siraaj Rahman a colleague of mine in the University and he was from the students of Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi – I don’t know whether – I saw this in Kenya or a story had been narrated to him that this had begun to spread in al-Madinah. Anyway, he mentioned that Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi said the statement: ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ and this is disbelief, what they mean by this is that Muhammad is a partner to Allaah –Azza wa Jal; Allaah &amp; Muhammad are equal.<br /><br />There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger; this is the highest status for this Noble Prophet –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam.<br /><br />The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:<br /><br />‘Do not over praise me, like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam. Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’<br /><br />I have seen this clearly and I would have waged war against it, and if I saw it in a Masjid I would advise the Imam of the Masjid. Likewise in Masjid al-Qiblatayn – Masjid al-Amoodi -, I spoke to the Imam, but he did not do anything! So I spoke to al-Amoodi who was responsible for the Masjid, and he hastened – may Allaah reward him with goodness- and effaced these things.<br /><br />And in the Masjid near my home in al-Madina they had written ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ so I advised the Imam and he said: ‘we will change it, we will change it.’ But he kept postponing it and did not change it! There was a good young man present who said: ‘I’ll sort it out.’ Then he went and covered it, and that was the end of that, and all praise be to Allaah.<br /><br />One day I was coming from Batthan and entered Madinah and there was a pickup truck in front of me and it had ‘Ya Allaah Ya Muhammad’ written on it in red. So I followed him and he began speeding up, he noticed that I was following him, so he began to speed up even more, so I gave chase and pursued him until we reached Qurban, he stopped his car and got out and said to me: ‘Shall I wipe it off?’ and I hadn’t even spoken to him yet! He knew and felt this is what I was pursuing him about, so I told him ‘Yes, wipe it off.’<br /><br />This confirms that there is a battle going on, the battle of these grave worshipping deviants in the land of Tawheed!<br /><br />[Taken From: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=128851%5D">http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?s ... =128851%5D</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/writing-ya-allaah-ya-muhammad/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... -muhammad/</a><!-- m --></div>
