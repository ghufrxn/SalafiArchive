<subtitle>Expounding the way of the Salaf us-Saleh in implementing the Quran and Sunnah. Indeed they (Ahl al-Hadith) acted upon the hadith whilst opposing blind following - the true madhab free from opinions and partisanship, which the companions taught the people</subtitle>

By Shaykh Hussayn bin ‘Abdul-‘Azeez aal ash-Shaykh [May Allaah Preserve him], Imaam and Khateeb of Masjid an-Nabawee and a Senior Judge in the High Court in Madeenah<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ {1}<br /><br />اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ {2}<br /><br />لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ {3}<br /><br />وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ {4}</span></span><br /><br />1. Say (O Muhammad): &quot;He is Allah, (the) One.<br />2. &quot;Allah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks).<br />3. &quot;He begets not, nor was He begotten;<br />4. &quot;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&quot;<br /><em>[Surah Ikhlaas 112:1-4]</em><br /><br />The virtues of this Surah has been narrated in various Ahaadeeth, such as what is narrated in the authentic narration that its recitation is like a third of the Quraan in reward.<br /><br />Also, this Surah affirms the Tawheed in Allaah, so the one who loves to recite it and its meaning then he becomes Loved by Allaah. Therefore this Surah and Tawheed are both loved to the believer.<br /><br />It is reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] would recite this Surah as well as Surah al-Kaafiroon in the two Sunan of Fajr, in the two Ra’kaat after Tawaaf and the two Sunan of Maghrib.<br /><br />This Surah was revealed because someof the Mushriks of Quraysh asked the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] about the lineage of Allaah so this Surah was revealed, this was reported in Sunan at-Tirmidhee.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘Allaah’</span>: This is the One true God which is known by the Fitrah of every human.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘the One’</span>: Meaning He is Alone, Perfect and none has these qualities except He.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘As-Samad’</span>: meaning He is Self-Sufficient, He doesn’t need others rather we need Him. He is sufficient for Himself, He is perfect and He doesn’t need anything to survive unlike humans.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘There is nothing like him’</span>: There is nothing comparable to Him.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ {1}<br /><br />مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ {2}<br /><br />وَمِنْ شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ {3}<br /><br />وَمِنْ شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ {4}<br /><br />وَمِنْ شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ {5}</span></span><br /><br /><br />1. Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak,<br />2. &quot;From the evil of what He has created;<br />3. &quot;And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness; (or the moon as it sets or goes away).<br />4. &quot;And from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots,<br />5. &quot;And from the evil of the envier when he envies.&quot;<br />[Surah al-Falaq 113:1-5]<br /><br />These final two Surah’s of the Quraan were given to the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] as a means of protection from all forms of illnesses and he was commanded to seek protection from them.<br /><br />It is reported that The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, “I have not been given anything like these two before so we should ask by them.” Meaning we should seek Ruqya with them.<br /><br />Therefore, these final two Surahs are beneficial for the body as well as the areas of ‘Aqeedah they address.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘To seek refuge’</span>: Meaning, to turn to Allaah, the Mosy High, and put trust in all our affairs in Him.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘The Lord’</span>: The Lord refers to Allaah, the Mos High, being the King, His is the Dominion, He Decrees, He Creates, He Sustains, He Gives life and He Gives death. These are all characteristics of a Lord and fall into our belief in Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘The daybreak’</span>: the scholars of Tafseer have said that this means we seek refuge in Allaah from the morning sunrise. Others said it can refer to seking refuge in Allaah, the Most High, in all the evils the day has ahead of us.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘With He has Created’</span>: this is general, thus we seek refuge in all the evils that may occur during the day.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘Evil’</span>: It is important to know that evil cannot be attributed to Allaah, the Most High. It states in Surah al-Jinn that the evil is only attributed to the creation, thus we cannot say a evil thing that has occurred is from Allaah, the Most High, rather He Willed it to occur.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘…evil of the darkening’</span>: meaning we sought refuge in Allaah from the evils of the days and now we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of the night. So the darkening refers to the sunset and beyond, meaning the night. This is because the worse of creation come out at night, from jinn, human and animals.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘Nafaath’</span>: This refers to the person who does withcraft and all forms of magic.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><br />قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ {1}<br /><br />مَلِكِ النَّاسِ {2}<br /><br />إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ {3}<br /><br />مِنْ شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ {4}<br /><br />الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ {5}<br /><br />مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ {6}</span></span><br /><br />1. Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind,<br />2. &quot;The King of mankind,<br />3. &quot;The Ilah (God) of mankind,<br />4. &quot;From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one's heart after one remembers Allah)<br />[Surah an-Naas 114:1-4]<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘Lord of Mankind’</span>: Here Allaah, the Most High, has attributed Himself tobe the Lord of Mankind, thus this is a honour and a form of respect given the children of Aadam.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘The King’</span>: Meaning, He Created mankind, He Controls what they have, His is the Dominion over them with Justice, the Eternal King.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘The God of Mankind’</span>: Meaning the only true Lord that mankind have.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">‘Khanaas’</span>: Khannaas is derived from the root word Kha - na - sa, the same root word in which the word ‘khunas’ or planets is derived from. So the Khannaas are those who orbit or move around the people, referring to the evil Shayaateen.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/tafseer-al-ikhlaas-al-falaq-and-naas.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09 ... -naas.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2016 12:00 am</p><hr />
