<title type="html"><![CDATA[All of Soorah Faatihah is about Tawheed]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=811&amp;p=855#p855"><![CDATA[
<em>In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</em><br /><br />In a previous article, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy upon him) explained how all of the Qur’an is regarding Tawheed. Every Aayah in the Qur’an relates to an aspect of Tawheed. He categorised the Aayaat of the Qur’an into five categories, each one of them linked to Tawheed. The article can be read here: <a href="http://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=810" class="postlink">Every Aayah in the Qur’an is regarding Tawheed</a><br /><br />The author then mentioned how every Aayah in Soorah al-Faatihah relates to Tawheed. In this article, with the help of Allaah, I will clarify this.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000FF">The General Meaning of Tawheed</span></span></strong><br /><br />It is a word we often hear being mentioned, however its meaning may not be understood. It can be summarised as:<br /><br />The command to single out Allaah in ALL aspects of Worship, and to single Him out in all qualities, characteristics, rights and attributes that are specific to Him.<br /><br />The opposite of Tawheed is Shirk, which is to direct an act of Worship to any other being, or attribute an exclusive right or characteristic of Allaah to another being.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000FF">Soorah al-Faatihah and Tawheed</span></span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">{الحمد لله رب العالمين}</span><br /><br />{All Praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds}<br /><br />This is affirming that only Allaah is the Rabb (Lord) of Creation. It therefore contains Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah, which is the exclusive right of Allaah in Lordship. He alone creates, owns, provides and controls creation.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">{الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ  مَالِكِ يَومِ الدِّينِ}</span><br /><br />{The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. The Owner of the Day of Recompense}<br /><br />This Aayah affirms two qualities and attributes which are exclusive to Allaah. Firstly He alone is entirely merciful, his attribute of Mercy is more comprehensive than any other being. He is also the sole Maalik (Owner) of the Day of Recompense. It therefore contains Tahweed al-Asmaa wa-Siffaat (the Tawheed of the names and attributes of Allaah). If any of these characteristics are affirmed for other than Allaah, it becomes Shirk.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">{‏إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ}</span><br /><br />{You alone do we Worship, and You alone do we seek help from}<br /><br />This Aayah shows us the obligation of directing all acts of Worship to Allaah, and only seeking help and aid from Allaah. This is the core essence of Tawheed. Opposing this Aayah results in a person contradicting the fundamental meaning of Islaam and is therefore Shirk (Polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">{إهدنا الصراط المستقيم}</span><br /><br />{Guide us to the Straight Path}<br /><br />This Aayah obligates upon us to supplicate to Allaah for guidance to the Straight Path. Supplication is an act of Worship and therefore must only be asked from Allaah. It also proves how true Guidance lies with Allaah and none other. Both meanings are Tawheed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">{صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ }</span><br /><br />{The Path of those who You have blessed}<br /><br />The path that we want Allaah to guide us to is the path of the blessed people.They are the people of Tawheed from amongst the Prophets, Messengers, truthful, martyrs, scholars and righteous people.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">{غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ}</span><br /><br />{Not the path of those who You are angry upon, nor those who have gone astray}<br /><br />A number of scholars have mentioned that the intent behind the ‘angered’ and the ‘astray’ is the Jews and Christians. This is because both groups of people oppose the command of Tawheed by refusing to Worship to Allaah, ascribing to Him partners and sons, and killing His Messengers. This Aayah is therefore a lesson to us about the people who oppose Tawheed – the people of Shirk.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Conclusion</span></strong><br /><br />This great Soorah is the first Soorah in the Qur’an. It exemplifies how all of the Qur’an is Tahweed, and how it is the most important message of the Qur’an. Tawheed is the core and essence of Islaam; a person cannot be a Muslim without affirming and implementing it.<br /><br />We ask Allaah to make us from the people of Tawheed, and to save us and our children from Shirk.<br /><br />Written by the one in need of Allaah:<br /><br /><em>Abul Abbaas Naveed Ayaaz<br />Nelson, Lancashire, UK<br />19th Saffar, 1436h<br />10th December, 2014</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.madeenah.com/all-of-soorah-faatihah-is-about-tawheed/">http://www.madeenah.com/all-of-soorah-f ... t-tawheed/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Dec 10, 2016 11:02 pm</p><hr />
