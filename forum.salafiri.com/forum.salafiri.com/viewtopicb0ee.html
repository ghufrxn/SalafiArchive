Did you do that?’ He replied, ‘No, by the One besides whom none has the right to be worshipped!’—and the Prophet عليه السلام knew that he had [in fact] done it—so he said to him, ‘Verily, Allaah has forgiven you your lie due to your attestation to, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’’”<br /><br />Al-Albaani said, “Al-Baihaqi said, ‘… what is intended is to show that even if a sin is great it does not mean that it necessitates the Fire as long as the [person’s] ’aqeedah is correct and he is someone for whom forgiveness has preceded [from Allaah]—a<strong>nd singling out a person in such a way [i.e., to say that a person has been forgiven as the Prophet did with that Companion] is not [allowed] for anyone [to do] after the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.’”</strong><br /><br />As-Saheehah, 3064.<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/it-is-not-allowed-for-anyone-apart-from-the-prophet-to-say-that-a-specific-individual-has-been-forgiven-because-of-his-tawheed/">https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/201 ... s-tawheed/</a><!-- m --></div>
