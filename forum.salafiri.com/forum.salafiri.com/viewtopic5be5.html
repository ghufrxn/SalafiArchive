				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">When Are Dua’s Accepted</span></span></strong><br /><em>Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</em><br /><br /><strong>In recent times when calamities are befalling the Muslims and all of us are in need of supplicating and asking Allaah for aid and assistance, we thought it would be important to compile something to show the times and instances when our duas are accepted.<br /><br />Generally Allaah listens to his servants and slaves any and every time and accepts their supplications and invocations, however there are instances when our duas are accepted a lot quicker or specified to be accepted. We wish to mention some of them inshaAllaah.</strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1. In The Month Of Ramadhaan</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Without doubt Allaah saves people from the fire of hell every day and night in ramadhaan and verily there is a dua for every Muslim in the day and night in the month of ramadhaan that is accepted.” (Imaam al-Albaanee said Saheeh Li-Ghayrihi, Saheeh at-Targheeb Wat-Tarheeb (no.1002), Kashf us-Sataar (no.962) of Imaam Bazzaar)</ul><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “There are 3 people whose dua are not rejected. (1) The just ruler, (2) The one who fasts until he does iftar and (3) the dua of the oppressed. Allaah will raise their dua on the day of judgement without any clouds and the doors of the skies will be opened and Allaah will say, I swear by my honour I will indeed help you even though it may be a little later.” (Tirmidhee (no.3598), Ibn Maajah (no.1752), Ahmad (2/305), Ibn Hibbaan (no.3428)  </ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2. On Laylatul – Qadr</span></strong><br /><br /><ul> Indeed, We sent the Qur’an down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn. (Soorah al-Qadr)</ul><br />Due to the virtue of this night and the great significance contained in it.<br /><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said: “Whoever stands (in prayer) in Laylatul Qadr while nourishing his faith with self-evaluation, expecting reward from Allah, will have all of his previous sins forgiven.” (Bukhaari and Muslim refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e 2/1100).</ul><br /><ul>Aishah (RadhiAllaahu AnhA)  narrates, “I asked Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), “If I find Laylatul Qadr then what should I do? He (the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)) said, recite this Dua.“ALLAAH HUMMA INNAKA A’FUWUN TOHI BUL AFVA FA’AFU ANNI” (Ibn Maajah (no.3850), Tirmidhee (no.3513), Mishkaat (no.2091) Allaamah al-Albaanee said Saheeh)</ul><br /><ul>Imaam Shawkaanee said, “One of the great criterion of this night is that the duas of the people are accepted and this is the reason why the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) encouraged the companions to search for this night and the great desire to attain it.” (Tuhfatudh-Dhaakireen (pg.46)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3. On The Day of Arafah (The 9th of Dhul Hijjah)</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Amr on the authority of his grandfather narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The best dua is the dua on the day of Arafah. The best dua I and the prophets before me made is, “la ilaaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa huwa a’la kulli shay’in qadeer.” (Tirmidhee (no.3585) Saheeh al-Jaam’e (no.1102) Imaam al-Albanee said Saheeh) </ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4. The Third Part Of The Night</span></strong><br /><br />The night is the period from the time of sunset until the sun rises.<br /><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Our lord descends to the heavens of this earth at the third part of every night and says, “Who is there who supplicates so that I may accept it? Who asks me so that I may give him? Who seeks forgiveness from me so that I may forgive him.”(Saheeh Bukhaari (no.1145) with Fath ul-Baaree (11/133), Saheeh Muslim (no.758), Tirmidhee (no.446) and Saheeh Jaam’e (2/1357)</ul><br /><ul>In another narration Amr bin Absah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Allaah is close to his servant in the last part of the night, if you are capable then supplicate and be from amongst those who remember him at that time.” (Nasaa’ee, Tirmidhee (no.3579), Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah and Mustadrak al-Haakim, refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e (1/259 no.1173), Mishkaat (no.1229), Saheeh al-Adhkaar (pg.73) Shaikh al-Albaanee said Saheeh)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5. A Particular Period Every Night</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Jaabir ibn Abdullaah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said,“There is a period every night in which a Muslims asks Allaah for goodness in this world and in the hereafter then Allaah definitely fulfils it and this period occurs every night.” (Saheeh Muslim and Musnad Ahmad, refer to Saheeh Jaam’e as-Sagheer 1/427)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6. In the Middle Of The Night.</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Uthmaan bin Abee al-Aas ath-Thaqafee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The doors in the heaven open in the middle of the night and a caller announces is there anyone supplicating that his supplication is accepted? Is there anyone asking for something so that he is given it? Is there anyone under distress so that this is made easy for him? No Muslim will remain who supplicates and his supplication is not answered, except the woman soliciting or the one who forcefully takes money from others.” (Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah 3/62)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7. Waking Up Suddenly During The Night.</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Mu’adh (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The Muslims goes to sleep whilst making dhikr of Allaah and then he wakes up at anytime during the night and then asks Allaah for any good from this world or the hereafter then Allaah grants him his request.” (Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah, Musnad Ahmad, and Tayalisee. Refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e 2/1003, Saheeh at-Targheeb no.597, Mishkaat no.1215)</ul><br /><ul>Ubaadah ibn Saamit (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said,“Whoever wakes up whilst sleeping he should recites the following la ilaaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa huwa a’la kulli shay’in qadeer alhamdulillahi wa subhanallahi, wa la ilaha illallah, wallaahu akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwata. And then he says Allaahumag-firlee and seeks forgiveness from Allaah or he supplicates, his dua is accepted and he gets up and makes wudhu and prays then his prayer will also be accepted.” (Bukhaari, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhee, Saheeh al-Kalim at-Tayyab)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">8. At The Time Of Adhaan</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Sahl ibn Sa’ad (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The dua is not rejected at 2 times, after the Adhaan and whilst it is raining…..” (Abu Dawood, Mustadrak Haakim and Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan. Refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e (1/590), as-Saheehah (no.1469) Saheeh at-Targheeb (no.266) (2 narrations combined)</ul><br /><ul>Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates a hadeeth that, “When the call to prayer is made the doors of the heavens are opened and supplications are accepted.” (transmitted by Abu Ya’ala, Tayalisee, al-Mukhtarah of Dhiya al-Maqdisee, refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e 1/203 and as-Saheeheh no.1413)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">9. At The Time Of Iqaamah</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>A mursal report from Makhool mentions the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “A supplication is accepted during the time of standing in battle for war, at the time of Iqaamah and whilst it is raining.” (Musnad Shaafi’ee and Ma’arifus Sunan Wal-Aathaar of Imaam Baihaqee, refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e 1/235, this report reaches the level of Hasan due to supporting narrations refer to Shaikh al-Albaanee’s as-Saheehah no.1469)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">10. Between the Adhaan and Iqaamah</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Anas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “A dua is not rejected between the Adhaan and Iqaamah. The companions asked, “what shall we ask for Oh Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).” He (the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)) said, “Ask Allaah for wellness/good health in his world and in the hereafter.” (Abu Dawood, Tirmidhee no.212, Saheeh Tirmidhee no.175, 244, Abu Dawood no.521, Nasaa’ee, Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibbaan and Musnad Ahmad (3/119), Shaikh al-Albaanee said Saheeh, refer to, Irwaa ul-Ghaleel no.224, Takhreej al-Kalim at-Tayyab no.73 of al-Arnaa’oot and Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.55 of Imaam Nawawee)</ul><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">A narration in Abu Dawood states, “A dua that is made between the Adhaan and Iqaamah is accepted hence make dua.”(Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood 1/105 of Allaamah al-Albaanee)</span><br /><br /><ul>The wording of the narration in Mustadrak al-Haakim is, “The dua that is made between Adhaan and Iqaamah is accepted.” (Saheeh al-Jaam’e 1/641 of Imaam al-Albaanee)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">11. At The Time Of Prostration</span></strong><br /><br />Allaah accepts the supplication that is done whilst in prostration.<br /><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “A worshipper becomes close to Allaah when he is prostrating hence make dua abundantly at such a time.” (Saheeh Muslim, Abu Dawood (no.875), Nasaa’ee no.1173, Baihaqee, Abu Awaanah and Musnad Ahmad. Refer to Saheeh Sunan Abee Dawood 1/166, Irwaa ul-Ghaleel no.456 and Saheeh al-Jaam’e 1/259 no.1175 and Saheeh at-Targheeb no.387)</ul><br /><ul>Similarly it is narrated by Ibn Abbaas (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)h the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said,“As for the prostration, then one should supplicate fervently, as it is possible it may be accepted.” (Saheeh Muslim, Abu Dawood, Nasaa’ee, Ibn Maajah refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e 1/536)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">12. After The Obligatory Prayers And At The Time of Suhoor</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Abu Umaamah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) was asked which dua is readily accepted? So he the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The dua during the last part of the night and the dua after the obligatory prayers.” (Shaikh al-Albaanee said Hasan in Saheeh Tirmidhee, Tirmidhee no.3499, Sunan Tirmidhee with Tuhfa 9/331, Saheeh Targheeb no.1648 and Mishkaat no.1231)</ul><br />The suhoor falls in the last part of the night and therefore it is included in this period. It is also a sign of the believers and those who have taqwaa to seek forgiveness in their duas.<br /><br />Allaah says,<br /><br /><ul>“They used to sleep but little of the night, And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness,” (Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat 51:17-18)</ul><br />And<br /><br /><ul>“The patient, the true, the obedient, those who spend [in the way of Allah ], and those who seek forgiveness before dawn.” (Soorah Ale-Imraan 3:17</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">13. Whilst Fighting The Kuffar</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Sahl ibn Sa’ad (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “The dua is not rejected at 2 times, after the Adhaan and when 2 armies are ready to battle” (Shaikh al-Albaanee said Saheeh, Abu Dawood no.2540, Refer to Saheeh al-Jaam’e (1/590 no.3079), Saheeh at-Targheeb (no.266)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">14. Whilst Drinking Zam Zam Water</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Jaabir ibn Abdullaah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said,“Whatever (good deed) zam zam water is drank for, it is fulfilled.” (Shaikh al-Albaanee said Saheeh, Saheeh Ibn Maajah no.2484, Ibn Maajah no.3062)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">15. A Specific Period On Jumu’ah</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “There is a period on Jumu’ah that if a Muslim asks Allaah for something whilst praying then Allaah grants him his request. Then he the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) indicated with his hands the shortness of that period” (Bukhaari no.935, 5294, Muslim no.852, Ibn Maajah no.1082. refer to Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.53)</ul><br /><ul>Abu Lubaabah Badree narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “There is a period on jumu’ah that when a worshippers asks Allaah for something he is granted it.” (Shaikh al-Albaanee said Hasan, Saheeh Ibn Maajah no.888)</ul><br /><ul>The wording of Saheeh Muslim is, “There is a short period.” (refer to Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.54)</ul><br /><ul>This period is not exactly known but Imaam Ahmad said, “We find from most of the ahadeeth about this period and we hope that our dua are answered, is after the Asr prayer or we hope it is after the sun reaches its zenith ie jumu’ah time.”(Sunan Tirmidhee 2/361 cited from Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.54-55)</ul><br /><ul>The Scholars have differed as to the exact time of this period due to the differing and various narrations that mention this period which led Haafidh Ibn Hajr as citing 40 various statements of the Scholars pertaining to this period (Fath ul-Baaree 3/82). Hence duas should be made after jumu’ah till the end of the day, as some of the scholars have said. (Fatwaa Islaamiyyah 1/400)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">16. On the Night of Jumu’ah</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “There is a period on the night of jumu’ah (ie Thursday evening.) in which a dua is accepted.” (Sunan Tirmidhee cited from Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.54)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">17. During Rain</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Seek the time of the acceptance of dua, when 2 armies meet to battle, during the time of Iqaamah and when it rains.” (Silsilatul-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah no.1469)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">18. After Reciting The Quraan</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Imraan ibn Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Whoever recites the Quraan should ask Allaah with it (ie make dua) as in the future there will come a group of people who will recite the Quraan but yet still ask the people (for help) by it.” (Shaikh al-Albaanee said Hasan, Tirmidhee no.2917, Musnad Ahmad no.19039, Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah 1/461)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">19. During The Gathering of Muslims</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>The Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “When a nation gathers and indulges in the dhikr of Allaah the angels encompass them and the mercy of Allaah descends upon them and the tranquillity, then Allaah mentions them amongst what is with him (ie the creation with ie the angels.” (Saheeh Muslim, also Saheeh al-Adhkaar pg.57)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">20. When the Rooster Cocks</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)  narrates the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “When you hear the rooster cock then ask Allaah for his grace because it (ie the rooster) sees an angel and when you hear the bray of a donkey then seek refuge in Allaah because it sees shaytaan.” (Bukhaari no.3303, Muslim no.2729)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">21. After Closing the Eyes Of the Deceased</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Umm Salamah (RadhiAllaahu Anha) narrates “After the death of Abu Salamah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) went to her and his (ie Abu Salamahs (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) eyes were opened. So he Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) closed his eyes and said, “When the soul is taken the eyes follow it.” So the household started to scream so he Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) said, “Do not call up yourself anything except good as whatever you say at that time the angels say Ameen.” (Muslim no.920, Abu Dawood no.3118)</ul><br />And many more</div>
