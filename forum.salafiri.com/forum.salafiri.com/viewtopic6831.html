				<div class="content"><em>“And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone).” [adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56]</em><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said in defining worship:<br /><br /><em>“Worship is to do acts of obedience to Allaah, whether they are commands which are obligatory upon us or recommended.”</em><br /><br />He also said, “Worship includes every single deed that Allaah Loves (meaning what He has Legislated in His religion), seeking His Pleasure in your speech and deeds, in your inner and outer selves.”<br /><br />Ibn al-Qayyim [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br /><em>Worship is connected to ones tongue and limbs all of which stems from ones hearts (i.e. it includes your speech, deeds and beliefs).</em><br /><br />Al-Qurtubee [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br /><em>Worship has two components; that you humble and submit yourself.</em><br /><br /><em>So the meaning of the Aayah is that Allaah, the Most High, has informed us of the purpose of creation and the reason for why you exist; to worship Him Alone. This is from the wisdom of our creation.</em><br /><br />Ibn Katheer [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said about this Aayah:<br /><br /><em>Worship is to obey Allaah by fulfilling His Commands upon you and to leave what He has Prohibited. This, in essence, is the religion of al-Islaam. Therefore, the meaning of Islaam is to submit yourself to Allaah, the Most High.</em><br /><br /><em>This submission must comprise of humility towards Him, obedience and total compliance (TN: These are three characteristics which define worship, others from the scholars added a fourth, which is love. Therefore, if any of these is directed at other than Allaah in its totality, then the object has become the deity being worshipped).</em><br /><br />Ibn Katheer [May Allaah have Mercy on him] also stated in his Tasfeer:<br /><br /><em>The meaning of this Aayah is that Allaah Created the creation to worship Him Alone, without having any partners. Whoever obeys Him in this, He Will Reward them with the greatest of rewards and whoever disobeys Him in this then He Will Punish them with the severest of torments.</em><br /><br /><em>At the same time, He has told us that despite the command of worship upon us, He is not in any need of us or our worship towards Him. Rather, we are the ones who are poor servants in front of Him. He is the One Who is Rich and Provides the creation with their sustenance and rectifies their affairs.</em><br /><br />‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib [May Allaah be Pleased with him] said about this Aayah (51:56), “This Aayah commands us to worship Him Alone and to supplicate to Him Alone.”<br /><br />Mujaahid [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said in Tafseer of this Aayah, “We have not been created except that Allaah gives us Commands and Prohibitions.”<br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam [May Allaah have Mercy on him] commented after quoting Mujaahid: this explanation of the Aayah is more precise based on the Aayah:<br /><br /><em>“Does man think that he will be left Suda [neglected without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord (Allah) on him]?” [al-Qiyaamah 75:36]</em><br /><br /><strong>[Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitaab at-Tawheed (Pg. 10-11)]</strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/the-purpose-of-creation-is-that-we-have.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04 ... -have.html</a><!-- m --></div>
