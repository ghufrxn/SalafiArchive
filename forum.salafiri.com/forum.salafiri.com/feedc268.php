The brother replied as a comment, which again was based on irrelevant points. Instead of acknowledging the pertinent points raised, after claiming that my initial article was poorly written with spelling mistakes etc and that he would not be resorting tit for tat, he does exactly the same. He runs with his sob story and then proceeds to take a swip at the articles I've written on the website.<br /><br />let me make a few things very clear to you, to even someone who has been in the dawah for 2 decades as you claimed and read this properly before you get angry yourself. (what did you think we were, the books of the brothers you illegally scanned and put up have been publishing books for 2 decades, don't play childish games)<br /><br />1. i am not angry, this has been done to us not now but for 2 decades, our urdu and english books.<br /><br />2. I did not drag your name in the mud, you did by behaving the way that you did, all of this was avoidable,  we spoke you nicely, you brothers did not even respond to your salafi brothers that aimed to resort to the innocent defence story. Had you wanted to work with us and resolve the issues you would have replied and you did not.<br /><br />3. you claim you only help out, which i thing is wrong firstly and secondly its more than helping, you actively promote they channel, i can share screenshots if you want. There is also other evidence too.<br /><br />4. Gad you just shared books, it would have bene different, but we have come to learn you and your team even scan the books, had it been that you just share whats already out there its a different matter. You have actually scanned the books yourself. <br /><br />5. you say you have screenshots of us sharing books too and that you have evidence. Try to understand this point before you present your so called evidence. You have scanned and shared thousand of books. We have if any shared handful and even that was in the past and if an admin did they were reprimanded and corrected, this is in the english group. As for the Arabic group, some of these books have been shared by the authors or publishers and it returns back to out original point of harming the Salafi dawn. That is, if others have scanned it and you are merely sharing it to help people that is a totally different matter.<br /><br />However, like the Kharijis in the west like Kalamullah and Sunniconnect who have gone out of their way to scan Salafi books and promote the deviated ones, you connect to them and the people, this is not right. the point is, you guys have actually scanned books of salafi publishers. <br /><br />i am not interested in working with you guys due to your attitude. You reckless approach to Salafi publishers and crying about your name, you should have thought about the honour of your Salafi brothers before your embarked on your quest to inadvertently destroy other Salafi publishers.<br /><br />I put up a simple request on Facebook to remove our books from your telegram channel and the other channels you operate. As for your other insinuations pathetic swipes, then i don't have any problem with that and i forgive you as my salafi brother, but your reckless attitude has to stop, we approached you in the brotherly way and you came out and said we will do what we want, and you hid behind the issue of it being researched. We will share the views of the Ulama and you will see how many of them were similar view to us. You mention sh Bakr Abu Zayd, then please do share what he said.<br /><br />The 3 publishers i mentioned, there is another 1 from USA and we are talking to 2 others in the UK. will take legal actions against you and all those named, due to your complicit participation in this regard. i don't care who you are.  <br /><br />Your attitude should been from the onset, brothers we are so sorry we will take your books down right away because we are sure you have other projects to finish. Look at this link (these are just some of them),<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/e-books-pdfs/">http://www.salafiri.com/e-books-pdfs/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /> these were potential books but when we fist published our book,s people counterfeited them reprinted them without permission and some people scanned them online for decades we had to put our books in PDF format. What are the names of your book and where are the PDF's?<br /><br />Because of you and the telegram channel, the publishers are thinking of never sending books to the USA, i know i will never be sending books to the USA.<br /><br />also, we know exactly who scanned the books because we don't distribute our books, we sell directly to consumers, therefore we have a trace on every book. 2. we have put certain marks on each book when he posted to know which copy goes to whom. And since i know it was to salamis, we don't want to go down this route but you forced us with your reckless and bad attitude. The brother the books went to and you will end up through legal rulings.<br /><br />You claim you can be contacted, you blocked me and ran off in a storm because of these legal implications, once again to remind you, you are part of this team and we believe instrumental in it, yet your playing the innocent card game. I have now blocked you, when you had the chance to communicate with us, you blocked me and then unblocked me to comment on my post. this is your 2 decades in dawn and tit for tat attitude you were talking about.<br /><br />if you want to contact me, then do so via nay other means.<br /><br />May Allah forgive us, Amin.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Jun 18, 2020 10:32 am</p><hr />

i mentioned in a post that brothers who copy and scan books of Salafi brothers are like the ISIS, the brother took exception and was upset by this. The reality this is true and since the advent of these so called brothers who without even listening or reasoning with what publishers have to say they continue in their quest to harm and tarnish even Salafi publishers.<br /><br />They say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Regarding the issue of copyrights, as in many things in the Religion, there is a difference of opinion. And unless one has thoroughly studied the subject he is simply blindly following a Fatwā that he heard or read and should therefore - at minimum - respect the opposing opinion. Below is a question and answer of Shaykh Bin Bāz (in Arabic and translated into English) regarding the issue. <br /></strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This is actually not a point that requires answering, using what we understand as legitimate difference of opinion does not mean that they are litigate, the truth and understanding of the scholars should he sough and understood in context. If there is for example Shaykh ibn Baz on one side, there are 50 others on the other. The Masala is based on the texts and what is correct not that their is a fatwa that then allows you to take the rights away of authors and publishers. Which you have been illegally and illegitimately violating. To make yourself feel better you assert have not understood the issues besides you and that even if they have an opposing view it is just based on taqlid. This is atrocious and a very poor line of argument, more surprising and astonishing that its come from a Salafi brother!<br /><br />Since you shared the fatwa of Shatkh Ibn Baz, the brothers heard this fatwa live in the late 90's, so we already know it. Inshallah i will share many others in the posts below, to see how throughly you have actually researched it.  <br /><br />they say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Anyone who is strict against the sharing of the PDFs should exit the group for his/her peace of mind. We will do our best not to harm any authors or publishers but we will share their works when necessary.  </strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This is reckless attitude, they say they will try their best not to harm authors or publishers. The authors and publishers HAVE BEEN SCREAMING OUT THAT WE ARE BEING HARMED. So despite this this reckless and haughty attitude continues. <br /><br />They then say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Some books are out of print for many years and the only option is a PDF. Many people live in lands where the actual books do not reach. Many people just do not have the funds. A real student of knowledge will always have the book when he is capable of doing so but when he can’t he will resort to these PDFs. Allāh knows best. </strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />So, look at how when their is no viable islamic lawful justification, we switch and go to the rare and most unique examples of when books are out of print. Thats excellent and a service to ummah to scan these books, no one is stopping you, but to equate this and hide the the scanning of recent books of small Salafi publishers is oppression and affecting Salafi Da'wah. Furthermore, if books are out of print, then just email and say, your book is out of print, we have scanned it and uploaded it. Then when you do share say to people brothers, make a small donation to the people who published it (if they are active) so that they can release more works. <br /><br />Lack of sales and everyone in the middle trying to make money affect the publishers, scanning their books just makes it so much worse, and if these mature Salafi brothers had even the slightest amount of respect for the Salafi dawn and they wanted the dawn to spread let them publish one book and lets see how they feel. <br /><br />They say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Many people just do not have the funds</strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />We agree, but we find this is not that significant. The cost of books to other daily products like clothes, shoes, 'sneakers' and a whole host of other amenities is no where near books. Brothers spend more on a meal out. Yes some book prices are very high and those who have prices that are that high should work on it. However, when people keep scanning books, the publishers raise their prices to cover costs, so illegal scanners and uploaders are to blame for it.<br /><br />Furthermore, i don't know of any publisher that wants publish only a handful of books, given the circumstances they would want to publish more and keep the prices low, but these people harm them so much under the guise of helping the poor student.<br /><br />You talk about poor students, we give snd ship free books to ever needs them and we don't even ask for a single penny, not even for postage and packaging. If people order books, we sent them other books for dawn and ask them to give them out. We keep our prices as low as possible. Book prices that the sufis and innovators would charge double or triple the amount.<br /><br />Instead of understanding the situation and making modifications of your ethos and ethics, you show reckless attitude and claim you will continue to share the books. Brother, we are not stupid that you can use irrelevant and non-pertinent examples to justify your operations that not only do they violate rights of Muslims but also your Salafi brothers, who  aim to get books out to people and defend the Salafi creed and Manhaj. We have over 50 books that we want to print, but since you scanned the books, we can't generate the money soon enough to publish other books. The claim that student of knowledge who are into books, will always buy books is true, but at the same token your encouraging those who should be reading and buying books to wait and get the PDF. <br /><br />We are publishers don't tell us whats right and wrong, the islamic law and rights are on our side, as you shall come to know. We share books for free, and distribute them not you. Our books have been printed without our permission in far countries, we don't say anything because they are not in the west and people will benefit, yet you come and tell us you are the saviours and helping the umma with your scans.<br /><br />you have not spoken with the truth about these matters, and i will continue to shed light in future posts when i have time. For example the claim you take from sunniconnect is not true. They share books of deviants. As for ISIS, because you don't even the reality it is pointless telling you, but i do suggest look into he matter properly.<br /><br />we even give books FREE, people can order FREE books from us and we can't do this if you still have that poor attitude. At one time we had 4-5 free books. Its really sad and upsetting that takfirois have bene doing this to salamis for years and your just like them, so this is the equation you got upset about.<br /><br />The sunni connect has pdfs of Sayyid Qutb's In The Shade Of The Quran Fi Dhilal Al Quran Syed Qutb, this is deviance we are talking about, and this is your salafi dawah, i think its poor and no excuses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Jun 17, 2020 11:12 pm</p><hr />
