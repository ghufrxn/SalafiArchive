				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Questioner:</span></strong> O Shaikh, for example, a person who declares the Companions to be disbelievers, for example, he says that Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah is a faasiq or a faajir and likewise his father, ya’ni, is such a person a disbeliever [due to what he said] or a faajir or a faasiq?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Albaani: </span></strong>It differs, Yaa akhi, according to the person: is he ignorant, is he a scholar, has the proof been established against him from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah’s Prophet ﷺ, is he someone who is obstinate [in his opinion], is he someone who has misinterpreted [the texts]? All of these things prevent the people of knowledge from [both] rushing to call him a disbeliever or from rushing to state that he is not a disbeliever. All of these checks have to be implemented so that after them we will have the ability to state whether he is a disbeliever or not.<br /><br /><em>Al-Hudaa wan-Noor, 342.</em><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/al-albaani-on-how-careful-the-scholars-are-before-they-declare-someone-to-be-a-non-muslim/">https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/201 ... on-muslim/</a><!-- m --></div>
