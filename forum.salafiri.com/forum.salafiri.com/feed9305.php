<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shī’a Papers – Part 14 – Lies Fabricated Against Yazīd<br /> </span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span><br /><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong><br /><br /> <br /><br />All sorts of lies and fabrications are levied against Yazīd in order to discredit him. They also lie based on a deep rooted sentiment that Yazīd must be blamed for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu. These slanderous and treacherous accusations were concocted by none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.<br /><br />The undercover Ḥanafī Aquilani (Aqeel Ahmed) cited a few reports which elucidated that Yazīd was responsible for the death of companions, we will inshaAllāh address this point later. Just a basic rebound for this is there were numerous companions who were with Yazīd at the time and supported him, so will the same be levied against them.<br /><br />It is also alleged against that he killed hundreds of people and desecrated the Prophets Masjid and his resting place.<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah refutes this claim and says,<br /><br />“10,000 people were not killed and nor was blood spilled at the Prophets Masjid and grave and neither was there any fighting in the Prophets Masjid.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/253]<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah went on to say,<br /><br />“None of the Muslims rulers from amongst Banī Umayyah or Banī ʿAbbās travelled to the Kʿabah with the intention of desecrating it. The representative of Yazīd nor Hajjāj bin Yūsuf the representative of Abdul Mālik did this, in fact all of the Muslims respected the Kʿabah.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/254]<br /><br />Aquilani Ahmed the deceptive undercover Ḥanafī boldly threw a hideous accusation of, “you cannot digest the criticism against Yazīd” and this individual based his foolish accusation on a number of narrations. From among the narrations he presented was that a person mentioned Yazīds bin Muʿawīyyahs name and said Amīr al-Muʿminīn whereupon Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz [101H] ordered for the man to be lashed 20 times. [Siyār ʿAlām an-Nabulā 4/35-40] as Aquilani Ahmed quoted<br /><br />However, the authentic narration is as transmitted by Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah where he said,<br /><br />“I have never seen Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz hit anyone except the man who cursed and abused Muʿawīyyah and he (Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAziz) lashed him.” [Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574], al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/139], Ṣawāʿiq Mehrqah [pg.221] and Nibrās [pg.551] of ʿAllāmah ʿAbdul ʿAziz Farhārwī [d.1239H], see also Nāhīyah ʿAnn Dham Muʿawīyyah [pg.20]<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shia-papers-part-14-lies-fabricated-against-yazid/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:16 pm</p><hr />
