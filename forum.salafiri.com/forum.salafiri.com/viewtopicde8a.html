				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Fitnah of Children Upon The Righteous People!</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Sulayman Ar Ruhaylee</em><br /><br />Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah—may Allah have mercy upon him said: As Hudaifah said to Umar رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُما<br /><br /><ul>فِتْنَةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ وَوَلَدِهِ وَجَارِهِ تُكَفِّرُهَا الصَّلَاةُ وَالصَّوْمُ وَالصَّدَقَةُ وَالْأَمْرُ وَالنَّهْيُ</ul><br />The afflictions for a man as it relates to his wife, his wealth, his children and his neighbor (and in another narration: himself, his children and his neighbor) are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining good and forbidding is evil.' Agreed upon.<br /><br />The Fitna for a man in his wife, his wealth and his children; what is the Fitna for a man in his wife, his wealth and his children? The scholars say: It is the distraction they cause him, or for the man to commit some impermissible acts outside of the major sins, because of them.<br /><br />The scholars say: The man may be tried from within his child (فِيْ ولده) and he may be tried by his child (بولده) and he may be tried from his child (من ولده).<br /><br />He could be tried by his children thus they distract him, and perhaps he could leave off some of his obligations because of his children, or he may commit some impermissible acts because of his children.<br /><br />How many people have never taken a picture before at all, and his picture has never been taken at all. Until he is granted a child, then he begins to carry a picture of his child in his cell phone! <br /><br />There are those from the people of good who have lived since they have known the truth, refusing to be photographed himself, and he does not have a picture except that which is absolutely necessary. But when he is granted a child he is the one who takes a picture of his child! He has been tried by his child.<br /><br />And he could be tried from within his child such that his child for example; is upon a path which is not good, or manners which are not good; and with Allah refuge is sought.<br /><br />And he could be tried from his child, such that the child calls the parent to evil. How many men were upon guidance and the Sunnah and the blessed good Salafiyyah by which the life is adorned and uprightness is actualized; then he was granted a child, and his child kept at him until he caused him to deviate away from it!<br /><br /><em>Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mtws.posthaven.com/">https://mtws.posthaven.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
