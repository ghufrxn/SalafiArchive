				<h3>And Both His Hands Are Right-Handed</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Mar 02, 2017 2:03 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> How can we make a combination between the report <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;with His left Hand&quot;</span></strong>, mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar, radyAllaahu 'anhumaa, in Saheeh Muslim and his, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And both His hands are right-handed?&quot;</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> There is no contradiction between the two hadeeths that is apparent on the outset. Thus his, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And both His hands are right-handed&quot;</span></strong> is an affirmation of Allaah's statement:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&quot;</span></strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]<br /><br />So this description, which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, has informed us of is an affirmation of Allaah's removal from any anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, the hand of Allaah is not like the hand of a human being â€“ left-handed and righthanded.<br /><br />On the contrary, <em>both</em> His hands are right-handed, may He be far removed from any defects.<br /><br />As for the other point, then it is that the report: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;with His left hand&quot;</span></strong> is <em>shaadh</em>[1], as I have clarified in the checking of <em>&quot;Al-Mustalahaat-ul-Arba'ah Al-Waaridah feel-Qur'aan&quot;</em> (no. 1) of Al-Mawdoodee.<br /><br />What further supports this is that Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth and (in it, he, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;with His other hand&quot;</span></strong> in the place of <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;with His left hand.&quot;</span></strong> This report is in conformity with his, sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, other saying: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And both His hands are righthanded.&quot;</span></strong> And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />[<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Asaalah</span></strong>, Issue #4]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br />[1] Translator's Note: A shaadh hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by a reliable narrator, which contradicts (the report of) a narrator that is more trustworthy than him.</div>
