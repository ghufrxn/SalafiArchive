<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Prohibition of Curing Magic by Using Magic – Shaikh AbdurRahmaan al Barraak]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=651&amp;p=694#p694"><![CDATA[
The following is Shaikh AbdurRahmaan bin Naasir al Barraak‘s reply to a question regarding curing magic using magic taken from the book: Shirk and what leads to it, the chapter on magic (Fatwa 17166)<br /><br />The Arabic text of this speech is in this file: <a href="https://sughayyirah.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/quote-al-barraak.pdf" class="postlink">quote al Barraak</a><br /><br />(originally from: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ajurry.com/vb/showthread.php?t=25441">http://www.ajurry.com/vb/showthread.php?t=25441</a><!-- m --> )<br /><br />Q: Is it permissible to cure magic by using magic when there is a need?<br /><br />A (Shaikh AbdurRahman bin Naasir al-Barraak): All the praise belongs only to Allaah. Curing or removing magic is called “an-nushrah”. It is narrated from Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah – sallallahu alayhe wa sallam was asked about an-nushrah, so he said: “It is from the work of shaytaan”<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">1</span></em></strong> (Imaams) Ahmad and Abu Dawood recorded it with a good chain. And in order to cure magic by using magic, one must go to a magician, ask him about who did the magic, and where is the location of the magic – and that is to nullify the work of the first magician. And it is known that the magician is a type of kaahin<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">2</span></em></strong>. And it has been authentically reported from the Prophet – sallallahu alayhe wa sallam:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">من أتى عرافا أو كاهنا فسأله ، فصدقه بما يقول ، فقد كفر بما أنزل على محمد</span><br /><br />“Whoever goes to an ‘Arraaf or a Kaahin<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">3</span></em></strong>, asks him (about something), and believes what he says, has indeed disbelieved in what was sent down to Muhammad.”<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">4</span></em></strong><br /><br />So it is not permissible to cure magic by using magic because that is from the work of shaytaan. And it requires asking the magician and believing him (which is prohibited due to the hadeeth he quoted).<br /><br />Ibnul Qayyim said<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">5</span></em></strong>:<br /><br />And “An-Nushrah” is to remove magic from the bewitched one.  And it is of two types:<br /><br />(1) Removing the magic using magic – and this is from the work of shaytaan<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">1</span></em></strong>. This is what al-Hasan (al Basree)’s saying refers to (None cures magic by using magic except the magician)<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">6</span></em></strong> So the one doing the nushrah and the one the nushrah is being done to get closer to him (shaytaan) by doing what he loves so that he (shaytaan) will cease his actions towards the bewitched one.<br /><br />(2)An-Nushrah by using Ruqyah<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">2</span></em></strong> and (reciting) the Ta’awwudhaat<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">3</span></em></strong> and dua and permissible medicines.  So this is permissible, on top of that it is recommended<br /><br />(end of quoting from Ibnul Qayyim)<br /><br />And some of the People of Knowledge have narrated from Sa’eed bin al-Musayyib – rahimahullah – that he viewed it as permissible to cure magic by using magic in cases of necessity. But it isn’t clear that the speech of Ibn al-Musayyib indicates that it is permissible to cure magic by using magic. Rather, it is possible that he meant: curing it by using allowable means. Even with that, Shaikh Uthaymeen indeed replied to this speech in “al-Qawl al-Mufeed” (2/73):<br /><br />“But in any case, even if Ibn al-Musayyib (had actually said it was permissible), or someone higher in status that Ibn al-Musayyib from those whose speech is not a proof (i.e. everyone other than the Prophet – sallallahu alayhe wa sallam) had viewed it as permissible, that doesn’t mean that Allaah has ruled it to be permissible – unless we refer back to the Book and the Sunnah – and the Messenger – (we ask that) Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace – was asked about an-Nushrah and he said: ‘It is from the work of shaytaan<strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">7</span></em></strong>‘”<br /><br />Footnotes:<br /><br />1 See footnote #1 of this article:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/the-prohibition-of-curing-magic-by-using-magic-ibnul-qayyim/">https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2013/ ... ul-qayyim/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />2 See this article:https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/definition-of-the-arraaf-the-kaahin-and-how-the-magician-is-from-them-and-like-them/<br /><br />3 See this article:https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/definition-of-the-arraaf-the-kaahin-and-how-the-magician-is-from-them-and-like-them/<br /><br />4 With the wording:<br /><br />من أَتَى عَرَّافًا أو كاهنًا فصَدَّقه بما يقولُ ، فقد كَفَر بما أُنْزِلَ على مُحَمَّدٍ<br /><br />Declared saheeh by Shaikh Albaanee in Saheeh al Jaamee (5939)<br /><br />There are other authentic wordings.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dorar.net/hadith">http://dorar.net/hadith</a><!-- m -->?
