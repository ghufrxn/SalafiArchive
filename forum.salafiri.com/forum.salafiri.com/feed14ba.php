<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Forgotten Sunnah: Allowing Rain To Touch One’s Skin -Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhali</span></strong><br /><br />571. Anas bin Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said,<br /><br />أَصَابَنَا مَعَ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَطَرٌ، فَحَسَرَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ثَوْبَهُ عَنْهُ حَتَّى أَصَابَهُ الْمَطَرُ، قُلْنَا: لِمَ فَعَلْتَ؟ قَالَ: لأَنَّهُ حَدِيثُ عَهْدٍ بِرَبِّهِ<br /><br /><em>“Rain fell on us while we were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took of his garment so that the rain could fall on him. We said, ‘Why did you do that?’ He said, ‘Because it has newly come from its Lord.'”</em><br /><br />The Shaykh commented on this narration in his explanation of al-Adab al-Mufrad by Imaam Bukhari on page 181 Vol 2. He said,<br /><br />“This narration contains the following benefits:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">First Benefit:</span></strong> The Companions were in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) most of the time.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Second Benefit:</span></strong> The permissibility of asking questions regarding legislative rulings (obligatory, recommended, hated, prohibited) in order to apply the answer. <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Third Benefit:</span></strong> The desirability to expose some of the body (when it rains) – like the ankles, arms or anything similar – as long as it is not part of the awrah. This is done at the beginning of the rain, just as it was done by the Prophet (peace be upon him).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fourth Benefit:</span></strong> The Prophet (peace be upon him) took off his garment when it rained because it came newly from its Lord. Meaning, Allah was the One who created the rain and allowed it to descend. It has been narrated that Allah entrusted Angel Mikaaeel (upon him is peace) with rain and vegetation. And Allah has the most expansive wisdom in everything He does, judges/rules with and decrees.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fifth Benefit:</span></strong> Rain is a mercy from Allah. This mercy reaches all of His creations on earth, despite their differences in creation.<br /> <br /><em>Translated by: Abu Awzaa’ee AbdusSalaam</em><br /><br />الفقير الى الله<br /><br />Share!<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tryingtofollowthesalaf.com/2016/02/02/forgotten-sunnah-allowing-rain-to-touch-ones-skin-shaykh-zayd-al-madkhali/">http://tryingtofollowthesalaf.com/2016/ ... -madkhali/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Feb 20, 2017 12:19 am</p><hr />
