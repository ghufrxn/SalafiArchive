(Mukhtasar Qiyam ul-Layl)<br /><br />With regards to any individual from the Ummah saying that we should raise our hands cannot be superimposed on the words of the leaders of both words the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam), even though if it may be good to observe or to look at (ie the action of dua in the Witr) whereas in reality he is free from it.<br /><br />If however it was something good or beneficial the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) would have most definitely not kept it from us because this would be treachery and Allah has purified him of this.<br /><br /><strong><em>Refer to Raf’a as-Satr Min Ahkam al-Witr, manuscript form</em></strong><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/innovation-of-raising-the-hands-in-qunut-al-witr-and-saying-allahu-akbar/">http://www.salafiri.com/innovation-of-r ... ahu-akbar/</a><!-- m --></div>
