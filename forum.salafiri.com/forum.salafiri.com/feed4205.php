The Shaikh who is a member of the Permanent Committee of the Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia analyses the difference between the mainstream Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah and the Sufi's and how they have deviated from the correct and authentic teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.<br /><br />Shaykh Dr. Sa'd bin Naasir ash-Shathree is known amongst the people for his diligence and efforts in teaching the Quran and Sunnah. There are a couple of books of the Shaykh which have been translated into English and this being the latest one on an issue which has been highlighted by the western neo-con agenda in falsely tackling the creed system and tenets of faith of Ahl al-Sunnah Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />In recent years the neo-cons have also emphatically promoted the Sufi idea to the western Muslims, however it is far away from the true teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.
