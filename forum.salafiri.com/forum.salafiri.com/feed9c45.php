<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Does ablution [1] become invalid by merely looking at women or men who are naked [2] ; also does it become void if a person looks at his own private parts [3] ?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> All praise is due to Allaah alone, and may the peace and blessings be with His Messenger, his family, and his companions.<br /><br />To proceed: The ablution of a person does not become invalid by merely looking at women and men who are in a state of nudity, or by simply seeing one’s private parts, as there is no evidence or proof with regards to this.<br /><br />Allaah is the possessor of all prosperity &amp; success, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be with our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Reference:</span></strong> <em>Fataawaa Al Lajnah Ad Daaimah, Volume 5: Fatwaa no: 6541</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Refer to Surah: 5 [Alma’idah] Ayah no: 6 in the Qur’aan for a description regarding the ablution Islamically known as (الوضوء).
