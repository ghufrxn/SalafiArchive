				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Following the Messenger is Upon Everyone</span></strong><br /><em>Narrations of the Salaf part 5<br /><br />Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1 – Imam Shaafi’ee (d.199 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘The first of manners which should be followed is that which the Messenger of Allaah  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘al-Adab’ by al-Bayhaqi (300) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 – Abul Abbas bin ‘Atta said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘Whoever adheres to the manners of the Sunnah then Allaah enlightens his heart with the light of knowing his –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah.  There is no station/status more noble than following the beloved –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his commands, actions, his manners and in following his manners in statements and actions and intentions.’<br /><br />[Taken from: Zuhud al-Kabeer by al-Bayhaqi (287) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5-6]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘Know that it is obligatory upon every mature, intelligent person from mankind and the Jinn to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.<br /><br />Allaah sent him with the guidance and the religion of the truth to make it uppermost above all religions, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. Allaah sent him to all of creation, mankind and Jinn, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the Persians and the Indians, the Barbars and the Romans, and all the different types of non-Arabs, black and white.  What is meant by non-Arabs is those who do not have the Arab language, amongst all their different languages.<br /><br />So Muhammad –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was sent for every single person from the humans and the Jinn, whether they are from those who follow a revealed Book or not. He was sent for every single person in relation to his Deen, from the inward matters and outward ones, regarding his beliefs, realities, methods and his legislations.<br /><br />So there is no ‘Aqeeda/belief except the Messenger’s –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ‘Aqeeda, and there is no reality except his reality, and there is no method except his method, and there is no legislation/Sharia’ except his Sharia’/legislation.<br /><br />No one from the creation can reach to Allaah, and to His pleasure, and His Paradise, and to His Generosity, and His Guardianship except by following the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- inwardly and outwardly, and in sayings and actions inwardly and outwardly, in statements of the heart and its beliefs, and the conditions of the heart and its realities, and the statements of the tongue and the actions of the limbs.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/430-431]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4 – Imam Abu Muthaffar Samaani (d.489 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘Indeed we have been ordered with following and have been recommended to it, and prohibited from innovating and rebuked for it.  The sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is that they follow the Salaf as-Salih, and that they leave everything that is innovated and a novelty.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘al-Inteesar li Ahl-ul-hadeeth’ p.69]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘As for the beliefs (al-‘Iteeqad) then it is not taken from me nor from someone more senior than me, rather it is taken from Allaah and His Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and that which the Salaf of the Ummah were gathered upon.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 3/161]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6 – al-Hasan al-Basari (d.110 A.H.)  said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘A statement is not correct except with action, and a statement and action are not correct except with intention, and a statement and action and intention are not correct except with the Sunnah.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘Sharh Asool I’teeqad’ 1/57]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘Following the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is a proof and evidence that the follower loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal – and what indicates to that is the saying of – Jala wa ‘Ulaa – : &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 1/334]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">8 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</span></strong><br /><br />‘What is necessary to comprehend is that Allaah Subhanahu said in His Book: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]<br /><br />A group from the Salaf said: there were a people at the time of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who claimed that they love Allaah, so Allaah revealed this Ayaah: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]<br /><br />So Allaah explained that His love obligates following the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- which in turn obligates the love of Allaah for His slave.  Allaah tested those who claim to love Allaah by this specific love, and indeed this issue has many claimants and those who are dubious in their love for Allaah.’<br /><br />[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/81]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/following-the-messenger-is-upon-everyone/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... -everyone/</a><!-- m --></div>
