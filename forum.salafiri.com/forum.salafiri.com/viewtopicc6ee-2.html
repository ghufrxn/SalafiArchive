Rather, the reason for the prohibition of liquor is its intoxicating effect. Based on this, it is understood that the presence of alcohol in a substance or in a drink does not necessitate that it is deemed liquor (i.e. impermissible) unless and until it is found to be intoxicating. Building on the foregoing, we state that the mere presence of alcohol in a medicine or in a drink is not sufficient reason for it to be treated (legislatively) as liquor, unless the amount (ratio) of alcohol in it is such that if consumed in quantity, will cause intoxication; then at that point we say the ruling for such (a medication or drink) is the same as the ruling of liquor. This is because, “Whatever causes intoxication (when consumed) in quantity then even a little of it is forbidden”[2]<br /><br />The preceding clarifies the difference between attributing the prohibition to intoxication and between what some people (mistakenly) think is the reason for the prohibition, (namely) the (mere) presence of alcohol.<br /><br />Additionally, it has been proven in lab results that alcohol is present (in small quantities) in many items that are (commonly) consumed today. Raising agents, dough, juices, fermented drinks, etc. all have a certain percentage of alcohol in them. However, this (tiny) percentage of alcohol is such that if you were to consume large quantities of these substances you would not become intoxicated. As such, it is a mistake to treat the foregoing substances as we treat liquor.<br /><br />Yet, if the ratio (i.e. quantity) of alcohol in this food or drink was such that if you were to consume a large amount of it, it would intoxicate you, then we would say the ruling is the same as that of liquor. So based on this, our concern is with the ratio of alcohol present in the item.<br /><br />As regards alcohol, there are three possibilities (when consuming it):<br /><br />The first is that it will cause toxicity (i.e. poisoning the person consuming it). This is when it is found in high ratio (in the item consumed) and it will give the same effect as poison, leading to death. In this case we say that if consuming this type of substance (or quantity) will show the effects of toxicity, that being death, then we say it is impermissible to consume it because doing so is harming oneself or killing it in this fashion, and killing oneself is forbidden.<br /><br />The second is that alcohol is found in (the substance in) very small amounts such that regardless of how much you consume of that food or drink, even in large quantity, it will not have any (intoxicating) effect. So consuming such a substance is the same as consuming other permissible items and there is no sin in it.<br /><br />The third is when the alcohol ratio found in this food or drink is such that if you were to drink a lot of it, or eat a large amount of it, then it would lead to intoxication. It is this ratio of alcohol that we say will take the same ruling as liquor and it is impermissible to consume it in any quantity, be it little or a lot, because the Messenger (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whatever leads to drunkenness in quantity then even a little of it impermissible”[3].<br /><br />Thus, we conclude that if the ratio (amount) of alcohol found in these medications falls under the second category - which if consumed (in quantity) causes no intoxication - then consuming this medication containing alcohol is permissible. However, if this medication contains alcohol in a ratio that if consumed in large quantities will lead to death then it is impermissible since this is akin to consuming poison. And if it contains alcohol in a ratio that leads to intoxication (if consumed in quantity) then it is this category that is considered as having the same ruling as liquor. This is what relates to the ruling regarding this medication and Allah Knows Best.[4]<br /><br />A Question Posed to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Umar Baazmool on the 22nd<br />Safar, 1435 A.H. Corresponding to the 25th December, 2013 C.E.<br /><br />Download/Listen Here [Arabic/English]: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../www.mpubs.org/files/MUBZ_20131225_ruling_on_medicine_containing_alcohol_ar_eng.mp3">http://www.mpubs.org/files/MUBZ_2013122 ... ar_eng.mp3</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Footnotes:</span><br />1 Liquor here is being used as a loose translation for the Arabic word Khamr, which comes from the root meaning of “mingling with”, “covering” or “clouding”; hence the statement of the scholars that Khamr is anything that clouds the mind. The word “ ???? ” Khimaar - a woman’s veil - shares the same root as it covers her from sight. Wa Allahu ta’aalaa aa’lam.<br /><br />2 This is the text of a hadeeth narrated by al-Imaam Abu Dawuud [3681] and at-Tirmithi [1865] and others on the authority of Jaabir Ibn ‘Abdillah and others from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Al-Imaam al-Albaani ranked it Authentic.<br /><br />3 See previous note for referencing of this narration.<br /><br />4 Any variance found in the wording of the translation between the audio and the transcript is due to the edits made by the translator for accuracy and readability.</div>
