				<h3>Doubt: Scholars Don’t Know Current Events – Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah)</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Doubt: Scholars don’t know Current events</span></span></strong><br /><em>Answered by Shaykh Al Albani (1420 H)</em><br /><br /><strong>Questioner:</strong> When you mention the statement:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">فَاسْأَلُوا أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</span><br /><em>So ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know. (Soorah An Nahl 16:43)</em><br /><br />There come some doubts from the youth when the likes Shaykh Al Albani, or Shaykh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, or others are mentioned to them. They reply to them saying: Shaykh Al Albani or Shaykh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, they have understanding in Fiqh issues, and Hadith, and these affairs. As for the affairs of Jihad and fighting they require experience. So whom will we take them matters from? From those on the front lines and from those who know these affairs.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Al Albani:</span> It is correct; Al Albani, nor ibn Baz or other than them don't know how to carry a weapon, but does this mean they do not know the rules of Jihad???<br /><br /><strong>Questioner:</strong> They know.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Al Albani:</span> What is the meaning of this speech? This is from the lure of Shaytaan for them; he makes fair seeming for them their verdicts that opposes the Book and the Sunnah.<br /><br /><strong>Questioner:</strong> Another question. From their analysis is that they say: Shaykh Al Albani or Shaykh bin Baz does not have an understanding of current events. They say: We live on the ground (in the midst of things) Shaykh Al Albani authenticates books.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Al Albani:</span> Very well. Give me a current event and then give me the legislative ruling for it. Give it to me so we can see. So we say to you; you know the reality of this event, but this reality does not give you the ruling. The ruling is taken from the Book of Allah and the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah.<br /><br />SubhanaAllah, this obstinacy is very strange.<br /><br />When the questions are presented to the scholars of the Muslims from every country in the world, there come questions about affairs which have taken place. Does the scholar know about the reality of these matters? He does not know about the reality of these affairs, but the one seeking the ruling describes these affairs as they took place.<br /><br />Why doesn’t he take the ruling himself, from the reality of these affairs, why does he ask the scholar?<br /><br />This is because he knows—regardless of who hates it—the scholar does not know about this affair but he knows the ruling for this affair.<br /><br />It is amazing that they justify their verdicts which are based upon ignorance of the Book and the Sunnah just because they are more familiar than so and so concerning the reality of the matter. May Allah bless you for your familiarity of this matter; but this familiarity does not give you the ruling for this matter. It is a must for you to ask the scholars, just as it has been stated in the Noble Quran.<br /><br />Any question which the scholar is asked, it is not a requirement that he is familiar with it as a reality; this is very normal. In reality, this statement alone is enough to show these people are deceived. Meaning they are deceived in their deviances in knowledge because they know more about the reality of the current events than the scholars.<br /><br />O my brother everyone who has a problem—and they are countless—then he will be more familiar with his problem than the scholar he is seeking the verdict from. But he is not able to receive a verdict except by asking the scholar. Thus we use the aforementioned verse as a proof against them, for asking the people of knowledge.<br /><br />Now some Jihadist groups have been established, what do they want? They want to strive in the cause of Allah. Okay, so the scholars and people of knowledge do not know the rulings for this Jihad, and if it is possible or not? And is it necessary to prepare first, especially the preparation we often mention which is a spiritual preparation?<br /><br />SubhanaAllah…with Allah help is sought.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/">http://mtws.posthaven.com</a><!-- m --></div>
