On Shaikh Hammaad al-Ansaari’s [1418H] Reading Habits<br /><br />“[Shaikh Hammaad al-Ansaari] would spend many a long hour going through books or checking manuscripts, when he came across a new book or a rare manuscript he wouldn’t sleep until he had read it all, until [sometimes] it would be fajr time and he still wouldn’t have finished his reading, then it would be the time of duhaa and he would still be engrossed in reading and researching, his addiction to reading, especially manuscripts, was one of the reasons that he had a problem with his eyes, may Allaah have mercy on him.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">He mentioned to me that he read Fathul-Baari twenty times.”</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Al-Majmoo’ fi Tarjuma al-’Allaamah, al-Muhaddith, ash-Shaikh Hammaad ibn Muhammad al-Ansaari, vol.1, p. 213.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://giftsofknowledge.net/2015/10/22/on-shaikh-hammaad-al-ansaaris-reading-habits/">https://giftsofknowledge.net/2015/10/22 ... ng-habits/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 18, 2017 1:15 am</p><hr />
