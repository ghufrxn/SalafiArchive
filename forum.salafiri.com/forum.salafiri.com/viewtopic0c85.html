And Al-Qa'nabee was from the Imaams of guidance, until some of the Huffaadh exaggerated in him and made him superior to Maalik [bin Anas], the Imaam. He (Al-Qa'nabee) died in 221H at some eighty odd years of age, and he is the greatest of the Shaykhs of Muslim [the compiler of hadeeth], absolutely.<br /><br /><strong>Source</strong>: &quot;Mukhtasar al-Uluww&quot; of adh-Dhahabi (p. 178).</div>
