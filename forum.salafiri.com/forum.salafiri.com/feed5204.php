<title type="html"><![CDATA[The First To Categorize Tawheed Into Three Categories]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=606&amp;p=648#p648"><![CDATA[
There is found from the speech of the scholars of the past the mentioning of three categories of tawheed, as for how it came about was through thorough research in following up the book and the Sunnah extensively, and this categorization of tawheed into three in an apparent manner was never present amongst the earlier generations from the time of the Companions nor those that came after them, rather it came afterwards in order to abridge the understanding on the Ayaat (i.e. ayaat In the Quran).<br /><br />So this categorization is not one which is innovated and non-legislated, rather it’s a clarification upon the evidences present within the Book &amp; the Sunnah. And from those who became renowned with this categorization was Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibnu Qayoum may Allah have mercy on them both.<br /><br />Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd mentions in his book ‘ At-Taahdheer min mukhtasiraat As-Saaboonee fi Tafseer’ (pg, 30) “this categorization which was founded by detailed study by earlier generation scholars of the Salaf, from those which indicated towards it were the likes of Ibnu Menda, Ibnu Jareer At-Tabaree and other then them, and this was acknowledged by Shaykhul Islam Ibnu Taymiyah and Ibnu Qayoum and also acknowledged to by Az-Zubaydee in ‘At-Taaj al Aroos’, and from the latter (i.e. scholars) our Shaykh Ash-Shanqitee in ‘Adhwaa ul Bayaan’.<br /><br />And it is a complete research of the texts of the legislation, and it (i.e. this research) is something which is present in each and different field (i.e. of knowledge), just like the research made by grammarians upon the Arabic language consisting of a Ism (Noun) fi’il (Verb) harf (letter) even though the Arabs never made mention of this, but still not one from amongst the criticisers censured them for this, likewise in other types of research”.<br /><br />I say <em>(Shaykh Muhammad Hizaam)</em> this was also indicated to by At-Tahaawi in the beginning of his ‘Aqeedah’ and also Ibn Hibaan in the introduction to his book ‘Rowdatul Uqalah wa Nuzhatul Fudala’, rather he who clearly categorised it into three types was Ibnu Bataa may Allah have mercy on him in the manuscript of his book Al-Ibaanah page 794-793, and he is the first whom I’ve come across from those that declared the categorization of Tawheed of Allah into three.<br /><br /><em>Translated from ‘Tawdhee al Mufeed Alaa kitaab Fathul Majeed’ (page31-32) by Shaykh Muhammad Bin Ali Al-Hizaam</em><br /><br />____________________________________________________<br /><br /><em>Shaykh Salih Ala Shaykh Hafithahullah mentioned in his explanation of Wasitiyah:</em><br /><br />The evidences indicate towards the categoratization of At Tawheed to:<br /><br /><em>1. Tawheedur Rububiyyah<br /><br />2. Tawheedul Uluhiyyah<br /><br />3. Tawheedul Asmaa Was Sifaat</em><br /><br />The scholars categorized it to this categorization and with them in regards to this is investigation of the evidences of the book and the sunnah and it has been frequently mentioned in the expressions of the older (scholars), from the scholars of hadeeth and the narrations, so it has come with Abi Ja’afar Al Tabari in his tafseer, and in other than it from his books, and in the speech of Ibn battah and the speech of Ibn Mundah and the speech of Ibn Abdul Baar and other than them from the people of knowledge from the people of hadeeth and narrations. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">In opposition to those from the innovators who claim that Ibn Taymiyyah innovated this categorization, then this categorization is old, it is known to those who examine the books of the people of knowledge.</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Sharh Aqeedatul Wasitiyaah Shaykh Salih Ala Shaykh Darul I’alimis Sunnah Ar Riyaad Page 22</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://aloloomenglish.net/vb/showthread.php?633-Who-Was-The-First-to-Categorize-Tawheed-into-three-Categories">http://aloloomenglish.net/vb/showthread ...
