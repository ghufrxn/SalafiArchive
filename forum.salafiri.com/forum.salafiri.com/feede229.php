<span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Listening to The Quran for Protection from the Shaytan – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">October 1, 2009</span><br /><br />Question:<br />There is a hadith wherin it is mentioned that if a person recites Surah Al Baqarah in the home, the shaytan will not be able to enter the home. Does this ruling also apply to one who listens to the Surah being recited from an audio tape?<br />Answer:<br /><br />No, the recitation from an audio recording does not benefit (with regards to protection). This is because it can not be said that the person has (in fact) read the Quran, but rather it is said that he listened to a previous recording. Similarly, if we were to record an athan, and at the time of prayer we played the recorded athan, this would not be accepted. Likewise if we did the same with a Jum’ah (Friday) sermon, and at the time of Jum’ah prayer we played the sermon through the microphones, and (person on) the tape said: Asalam u alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu, and then the caller of the athan calls to prayer, and the Imam gives the sermon (all on tape). Would any of this be correct and accepted? No it would not! Why? Because this is all considered a previous recording and it is similar to someone writing on a piece of paper or placing a Quran in his home. This does not take the place of reciting the Surah (for protection).<br /><br />S<strong>heikh Muhammed bin Saleh Al Uthaymeen – Liqa al Bab al Meftuh<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=368472">http://www.sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=368472</a><!-- m --><br />Translated by our brother Mustafa George</strong><br /><br />Share this, Baarakallaah Feekum<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Tue Sep 13, 2016 6:46 pm</p><hr />
