Therefore, it is not correct to use this hadeeth as an evidence to prove that the Sunnah is to essentially begin with the eldest of the people as is widespread nowadays.<br /><br />How can this be the case when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- himself did not do this, on the contrary the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave the drink to the Bedouin who was on his right hand side and not to Abu Bakr who was on his left hand side, then the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- explained by saying: ‘On the right hand side then the next one after him.’<br /><br />[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah by Shaykh al-Albaani (No.1771)]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/serving-from-your-right-hand-side/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... hand-side/</a><!-- m --></div>
