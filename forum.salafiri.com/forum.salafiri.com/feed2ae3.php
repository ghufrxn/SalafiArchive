<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Some of the Beliefs (‘Aqeedah) of the Raafidah (Shee’ah) from Their Own Shee’ah Sources.</span></strong><br /><br />1) To believe Jibreel [Peace be upon him] made a mistake in giving the revelation Prophet Muhammad [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] and should have instead gave it to ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib [May Allaah be Pleased with him]. [see: al-Mihal wa an-Nihal (Pg. 30)]<br /><br />2) There is no difference between the Shee’ah scholars and Allaah, the Most High. [see: Masaabeeh al-Anwaar (2/222-397)]<br /><br />3) The Quraan is distorted and incomplete. [see: at-Tanbeeh wa ar-Radd (Pg. 25)]<br /><br />4) The Shee’ah scholars came to complete the religion because the Prophet Muhammad [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] only gave us part of the religion. [see: Ihqaaq al-Haqq (2/288-289)]<br /><br />5) The Shee’ah scholars are a vice for us to get closer to Allaah, the Most High. So one is required to supplicate to them and not Allaah. [see: Bihaar al-Anwaar (23/99)]<br /><br />6) The Shee’ah scholars have the ability to control the universe and have the same Names and Attributes as Allaah, the Most High. [see: al-Kaafee (1/103)]<br /><br />7) Visiting the graves of Hussayn is like visiting the Throne of Allaah. [see: al-Mizaar al-Mufeed (Pg. 51)]<br /><br />8) The sand on the grave of Hussayn is a cure for all illnesses. [see: Kitaab al-Amaalee (Pg. 318)]<br /><br />9) ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib has the ability to bring the deceased back to life and some sects within the Raafidah even worship him as being a god. He knows the unseen and that he is the lord of the earth that lives on earth, according to them. [see: al-Kaafee (1/308 and 347)]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Raafidah (Shee’ah) are the Worst and Most Ignorant of People</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The Raafidah (Shea’ah) are from the most ignorant of sects. They are the worst of liars and furthest away from understanding the narrations (i.e. texts of al-Islaam) and intellect. They make lying and deceiving (what they call Taqiyyah) from the basis of their religion, so they lie knowingly attributing it to Ahl al-Bayt (the family of Prophet Muhammad whom they worship) with the worst of lies, to which none can count except Allaah.<br /><br />[Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (13/263)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Because they are Liars, their Narrations and Account of History is Rejected and Cannot be Relied upon.</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The origin of the innovation of the Raafidah is based upon heresy and atheism and they heavily rely on lying to support their beliefs. They are persistent in saying that the religion is based upon Taqiyyah. Taqiyyah is say something one may say to someone but you mean something different to what is understood from your speech. This form of Taqiyyah that they use is based upon hypocrisy and lies. They call people to this false belief whilst they claim that they are believers, and that there is no one upon the correct religion except them. They describe the best of this generation (i.e. the Companions) as being hypocrites and all of them (except a few) being apostates from the religion!...<br /><br />Therefore, there are no people who have apparent hypocrisy and are bigger apostates than them, and no one will find a group of deviants except that the Raafidah have the greatest number of apostates and hypocrites.<br /><br />[Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (1/30)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">They Venerate the Day of ‘Ashooraa as a Day of Mourning because of the Death of Hussayn [May Allaah be Pleased with him]</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The Raafidah (Shee’ah) take this day as a day of mourning because it is the day in which Hussayn, the son of ‘Alee, was killed.<br /><br />Taking this day as a day of mourning is from the deeds of those who are misguided and that they think that they are doing something good and righteous (cf. 18:104).<br /><br />Allaah has not Commanded nor did His Messenger to take the days in which the Prophets were inflicted with hardness or the days in which they died; as a day of mourning, so then what about those who lesser than them?<br /><br />Adapted from Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif (Pg. 43-45)<br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />It can never be beautified to anyone as to what the Raafidah do on this day. They mourn the death of Hussayn but his father, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib [May Allaah be Pleased with them both], was better than him but they don’t mourn the death of ‘Alee after he was murdered. ‘Uthmaan, ‘Umar and Aboo Bakr [May Allaah be Pleased with them all] passed away before them and they didn’t mourn their deaths either and they were better than him…<br /><br />Rather the best of creation, the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] passed away before them and his death was not mourned either.<br /><br />However, what they do to venerate this day to mourn the death of Hussayn has never been done before to mourn the deaths of those better than him. Moreover, taking a day as mourning is not the way of the Muslims, whatsoever. Rather, it is the way of the pagans of Makkah before al-Islaam.<br /><br />[Adapted from Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (25/307)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">History tells us that Yazeed bin Mu’awiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] did not order the killing of Hussayn.</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Salaah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />There is no authentic narration stating that Yazeed ordered the killing of Hussayn. What is authentic is that he ordered the killing of the one who ordered the killing of Hussayn, and his name was ‘Ubayd-Allaah bin Ziyaad, the governor of Iraq at that time. As for reviling Yazeed and cursing him then this is not the character of a Muslim, even if we were to affirm the accusation that he ordered the killing of Hussayn.<br /><br />[Qayd ash-Shareed min Akhbaar Yazeed (Pg. 57-59)]<br /><br />Imaam adh-Dhahabee said about Shimar bin Dhee al-Jawshaan:<br /><br />He was one of the killers of Hussayn [May Allaah be Pleased with him]. Him and his chosen group of men assassinated him.<br /><br />It is narrated that he said, “Oh Allaah! You Know that I am honourable to forgive me.”<br /><br />So it was said to him, “How can you be forgiven when you killed the son of the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him]?”<br /><br />He replied by saying, “Woe to you! What else can I do when I had been ordered by the governor to do so and I cannot disobey the command of those in authority.”<br />I say (adh-Dhahabee): This excuse is disgusting, because obedience to those in authority is only upon what is righteous.<br /><br />[Lisaan al-Meezaan (3/152) also see: Meezaan al-‘Itidaal (1/449), Kaamil fi at-Tareekh Ibn Atheer (4/55) and al-Bidaayah wa an-Nihaayah (7/270)]<br /><br />And Allaah Knows Best<br /><br /><strong><em>Source:</em></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/the-raafidah-sheeah-their-beliefs-and.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10 ... s-and.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Dec 22, 2016 10:57 pm</p><hr />
