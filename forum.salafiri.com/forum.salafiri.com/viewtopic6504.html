				<div class="content">1.Just because someone studies with a bonafide Alim, doesn't make him a major scholar, as the Khawarij studied with the sahabah for years!!!<br /><br />2.who does not know al-Qasimi, who died an atheist after defending the Creed of Ahl al-Sunnah after studying with scholars for years!Wake up<br /><br />3. Abul Hasan Ashari studied with Mutazilites for many years, his stepfather, al-Jubai yet he retorted to the Creed of the Salaf. Change!<br /><br />4. The wife of Abu Hanifah studied with wife of Jahm ibn Safwan, she is not attributed as a jahmi so why is the opposite taken as criterion<br /><br />5. Islahi studied with 1 of the greatest Hadith Master of the sub continent, al-Mubarakpuri yet looked what happened to him, Hadith rejector<br /><br />6.a student is on the Manhaj &amp; creed of his teacher in general. Look at refutations of the jahmiyyah, Ashairah &amp; jahmis by Ibn Jibrin while.<br /><br />7. Just the other day we read about Imran b. Hittan who married a kharijite woman &amp; thus became a khariji, so how about sitting &amp; tawun with them<br /><br />8.look what happened to the Egyptians who sat with the bonafide Sunni scholars of Ansar Sunnah, they later became despicable evil khariji's<br /><br />9.wahid uz-Zaman studied with imam Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi, look at what happened to his later views, he studied with him for ages!!<br /><br />10 &amp; Allahul mustan look at those who apostated in the time of Abu Bakr yet they had met our Prophet salllahualayhiwasallam, they were fought</div>
