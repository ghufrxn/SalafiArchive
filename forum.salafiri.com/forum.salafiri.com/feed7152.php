<title type="html"><![CDATA[The ‘Aqeedah of a Muslim is Simple and Easy to Comprehend]]></title>

Ibn al-Qayyim [may Allaah have Mercy on him] said in poetry:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">That is how your hearts are unlocked                    by having knowledge and Emaan</span></span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad bin Saaleh al-‘Uthaymeen [may Allaah have Mercy on him] explained:<br /><br />Theories and philosophy (similar to think-tanks and calls for updating the Sharee'ah) don’t effect ones heart, he spoke the truth here. <br /><br />If a person was to convey the message and beliefs of al-Islaam, by using complex philosophy or being proficient in theology (or debating it's rulings and beliefs), would the person you are calling understand and believe? He wouldn’t believe, rather it would be a cause of him rejecting al-Islaam.<br /><br />However the ‘Aqeedah of a Muslim is simple and easy to comprehend. If you told a layperson that Islaam is to testify that there is no god but Allaah and to testify that Muhammad is His Messenger, then this is conceivable and he has understood the very basis of ‘Aqeedah in these two short lines. But if we were to delve deep into matters of philosophy in trying to understand and explain al-Islaam, this wouldn’t benefit anyone. He spoke the truth, without doubt – may Allaah have Mercy on him.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">[Sharh an-Nooniyyah, line 238 (1/204)]</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2016 9:53 pm</p><hr />
