<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee on Gradual Progression in the Study of Kitaabut-Tawheed</span></span></strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">[Q]: Do you advise with the book: al-Jaami’ul-Fareed Sharh Kitaabit-Tawheed, which has been written in the manner of questions and answers by Shaykh Jaarullaah (d.1414H)?</span><br /><br />[A]: Yes, it is from the beneficial books. May Allāh have mercy upon him.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">[Q]: This one asks: How can a student of knowledge benefit from the explanations upon Kitaabut-Tawheed when they are many?</span><br /><br />[A]: He must make gradual progress in them. First, he must take for example, al-Jadeed fee Sharh Kitaabit-Tawheed of al-Qar’aawee, then he moves on after that to the questions and answers of al-Jaarullaah, and there is an old series of questions and answers on Kitaabut-Tawheed by Shaykh al-’Uthaymeen (d.1421H). It is published and it is now present and available. Then, after that, you must move onto Qurrah ’Uyoon al-Muwahhideen, then Fathul-Majeed. Then you must move onto the book of Shaykh Muhammad (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa), which is al-Qawlul-Mufeed. Then after that you can begin the lengthier books, such as Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed and the likes of it. So once you read these books with gradual progression, you will gain a clear understanding, and then you will make progress. And ask about that which is difficult for you. And it is better if it is feasible for you to read to someone who is at a higher level of knowledge than you, then that will be better. Yes.<br /><br />Translation by Maaz Qureshi<br /><br />1. al-Jadeed fee Sharh Kitaabit-Tawheed of Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-’Azeez as-Sulaymaan al-Qar’aawee<br /><br />2. al-Jaami’ul-Fareed li As’ilah wal-Ajwibah fee Kitaabit-Tawheed of ‘Abdullaah Ibn Jaarullaah Aali-Jaarillaah<br /><br />3. al-Qawlul-Mufeed ‘alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed of Imaam Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-’Uthaymeen (d/1421H)<br /><br />4.
