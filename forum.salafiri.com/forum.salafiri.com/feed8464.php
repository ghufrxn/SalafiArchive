Astonished On Those Scholars Who After Knowing The Truth Do Not Leave Their Opinion<br /><br />Says some scholars of the past.<br /><br />a) al Izz ibn Abdus salam said:<br />I have seen they gather in the Majalis and If it is mentioned in front of them the issue which is against them. They feel surprised and they do not listen to the evidence rather accept the blind following of their Imam. They think that Truth is with the madhab of our Imam.<br />It is waste of time to argue with them and there is no use of it.... It is better not to argue with them because when they do not find any evidence for the madhab of their Imam they say maybe our Imam had evidence for this issue and we do not know it. SubhanAllah Allah has taken the vision from many people who speak like this <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Qawaid al Ahkam of Imam al Izz bin Abdus Salam 2/275]</span></strong><br /><br /><br />b) Abu Shaama said<br /> ومن العجب أن كثيرا منهم إذا ورد على مذهبهم أثر عن بعض أكابر الصحابة يقول مبادرا بلا حياء ولا حشمة مذهب الشافعي الجديد أن قول الصحابي ليس بحجة ويرد قول أبي بكر وعمر ولا يرد قول أبي إسحاق والغزالي <br />It is Strange that when athaar of some Akaabr Sahabaa is mentioned against thier Madhhab many of them shamelessly say, The saying of Sahabi is not hujjah against the latter saying of Shafi'ee madhab..They reject the saying of Abu Bakr ra and Umar ra but they do not leave the sayings of Abu Ishaaq Sheraazi and alGhazzali. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Khutbah al kitaab al Momil liraddi ilal amril awwal page 71 translated by Abdul Raheem Salafi, taken from taqleed ka hukam by Wasi ullah Abbas]</span></strong><br /><br />c) Fakh ad-din al Razi said<br />قال شيخنا ومولانا خاتمة المحققين والمجتهدين رضي الله عنه: قد شاهدت جماعة من مقلدة الفقهاء، قرأت عليهم آيات كثيرة من كتاب الله تعالى في بعض المسائل، وكانت مذاهبهم بخلاف تلك الآيات، فلم يقبلوا تلك الآيات ولم يلتفتوا إليها وبقوا ينظرون إلي كالمتعجب،<br />Our Teacher and Mawlana who is end of (Muhaqqiqeen) and Jurists(Mujtahideen) may Allah be please withhim said, i have seen Jam'at from Jurists of blind followers (Muqallideen), i read in front of them many verses of Quran on some issues which were against their (taqleedi) madhab, not only they left to accept the verses they didn't even pay attention to it..<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[in the commentary of Quran under Sura Tauba verse 31]</span></strong><br /><br />d) Imam Dahabee(died 748 h) said <br />وكل إمام يُؤخذ من قوله ويُترك إلاّ إمام المتقين الصادق المصدوق الأمين المعصوم صلوات الله وسلامه عليه . فيا لله العجب ! من عَالِم يُقَلِّد دِينه إماما بَعَيْنِه في كل ما قال ، مع عِلمه بما يَرِد على مذهب إمامه من النصوص النبوية . فلا قوة إلا بالله .<br />We take and reject the saying of every Imam except Imam of the righteous Sadiq al Masdooq Al Ameen who is Infallible Prayers and blessings of Allah be upon him, By Allah I am astonished on that scholar who makes taqleed of a particular Imam in his deen on his all sayings, knowing that explicit ahadeeth are rejecting the madhab of his Imam. There is no Strength but in Allah <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Tazkara tul Huffaz vol 1 page 16 under the biography of Abdullah bin Masood RadhiAllahu Anhu]</span></strong><br /><br /><br />e) Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br />The one who has no knowledge and no ability to engage in ijtihaad must ask the scholars, because Allaah says: “So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know” [al-Anbiya’ 21:7].Allaah does not enjoin us to ask them except for the purpose of following their opinions. This is taqleed (following). But with regard to taqleed what is forbidden is adhering to a specific madhhab by following it in all cases and believing that this is the way to Allaah, so one follows it even if it goes against the evidence. <br /><br />But the one who has the ability to work things out (ijtihaad), such as the seeker of knowledge who has an abundant share of knowledge may engage in ijtihaad on the basis of the evidence, and follow the one who he thinks is correct, or is most likely to be correct. <br /> <br />As for the ordinary Muslim and the beginner seeker of knowledge, they should strive to follow the one who they think is closer to the truth, because of his abundant knowledge, strong religious commitment and piety. <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Al-‘Ilm, p. 205 see Islam qa fatwa no. 113687]</span></strong> <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Translated by Asim ul Haqq</span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2017 11:19 am</p><hr />
