<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> What is the ruling regarding reading or writing fictional stories and those which arouse the imagination? And if some of them [aid in] rectify[ing] social problems, then is this permissible?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> Fictional stories are from lies which occupy the time of the writer and the reader without benefit, so abandoning busying oneself with them is preferable. And if writing and reading [fictional stories] occupies oneself from that which is obligatory then this [fictional stories] is prohibited. And if it occupies oneself from that which is recommended then this [fictional stories] is disliked. In any case, the time of the Muslim is valuable, so it is not permissible to spend it in that which there is no benefit.<br /><br />Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan<br />ad-Durar an-Naadhirah fil-Fataaawa al-Mu'aasirah - Pages 644-645<br />al-Fowzaan - ad-Da'wah 1516, Jumaada al-Oolaa 1416AH<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Mon Jul 10, 2017 2:48 pm</p><hr />
