We will conclude with this question. Can you give a blessed word of advice for your children, your brothers from the students of knowledge in the Islamic nation collectively?”</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Shaykh Sãlih al-Fawzãn may Allah preserve him replies,<br /><br />Yes. I advise you all with the taqwa of Allah and to continue seeking knowledge, displaying an eagerness along the way and acting upon what Allah has taught you; inviting to Allah the Exalted and teaching the people what you have learnt. [I advise you to] leave off the quarrelling that occurs between the students of knowledge. The quarrelling, abuse and instigation between them has divided the Ummah and the students of knowledge. <strong><span style="color: #FF8040">“I warn you against so and so”, “Do not sit with so and so”, “Do not seek knowledge with so and so”, <span style="text-decoration: underline">this is not permissible</span>.</span></strong>  If a person has a mistake, then the advice should take place between you and him (private). As for you spreading it between the people and warning against him whilst he is a scholar, student of knowledge or a righteous man, however he erred, it doesn’t necessitate spreading [his mistake].<br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you do not know.}<br />(24:19)</span></strong><br /><br />It is incumbent that sincere advice is given between the Muslims. It is obligatory to display love and affection between the Muslims, particularly among the students of knowledge and the scholars, respecting the scholars without giving a recommendation for some of them and warning from others. This has been the cause for many wicked and evil things. It has been the cause for resentment, quarrelling, mutual hatred, and it has been the cause for trials and tribulations, stay away from these affairs. May Allah reward you all with good. Be as Allah wanted to you all to be.<br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{Indeed this nation of yours, is one nation.}<br />(24:92)</span></strong><br /><br /> [Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment.}<br />(03:105)</span></strong><br /><br /> <br /><br />Be eager upon existing in harmony, giving sincere advice between yourselves, cooperating with one another in righteousness and taqwa. Beware of those things that will cause you to be divided, specifically in this time that we are living in. The Muslims [today] are in a dire need to be united, to cut off the disputes between them, to cooperate with one another in righteousness and taqwa. Do not assist the enemy in separating the Muslims and dividing them. If separation occurs between the scholars and the students of knowledge, who will remain for the Ummah?<br /><br />The laymen do not have any blame, the blame is upon the students of knowledge, [they should] rectify [the problems] between the people and teach them. Leave these affairs, the quarrelling and the insults. <strong><span style="color: #FF8040">This is a reprehensible characteristic.</span></strong><br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{Do not backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it.}<br />(49:12)</span></strong><br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><br />{And do not obey every worthless habitual swearer. [And] scorner, going about with malicious gossip - A preventer of good, transgressing and sinful<br />(68:10)</span></strong><br /><br />Do not obey those people! Will you aid the shaytãn in separating the Ummah?! [You will aid the shaytãn] in weakening the Ummah! If you notice a fault [in him], then sincerely advise him, if this is proven true. Do not believe those who spread news.<br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.}<br />(49:06)</span></strong><br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace &quot;You are not a believer&quot;}<br />(4:94)</span></strong><br /><br />Allah the exalted encourages the unity of the Muslims, and the unification of the speech of the Muslims upon cooperation and sincere advice. We do not say, leave the mistake(s); no, correct the mistake(s). We say correct the mistake(s); do not leave the mistake but rectify it with the legislative means. May Allah grant everyone success to that which He loves and is pleased with and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), his family and his Companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Translated by Ismaeel Beaumont</span></strong><br />Al Madinah an-Nabawwiyyah<br />The Prophet’s City (ﷺ)<br /><br />28th Safar Rabi Al-Awal, 1436<br />Saturday 20th December 2014</div>
