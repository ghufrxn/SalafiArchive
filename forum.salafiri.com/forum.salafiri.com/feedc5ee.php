<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Virtues of Sending Salaah upon the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) – Sheikh Mashhoor Hasan</span></span></strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Sheikh Mashhoor Hasan aal Salmaan [1]</span>: Sending prayers upon the messenger of Allaah sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam has benefits, fruits and blessings in the two abodes that we can mention in what follows:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The first</span>, obedience to Allaah’s order, where He said, {Allah sends His Salat (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad ) and also His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salat on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting} [al-Ahzab: 56].<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The second</span>: Acting in conformity to that which Allaah does, in sending salutations upon him – as mentioned in the previous ayah and many ahadeeth, some of which will be mentioned. However, the two salaahs upon him are different – ours is a sending of salaah that is dua [for him] and asking [for him] and the Salaah of Allaah upon him is one of praise and honouring. Ibn al-Qayyim expounded upon this is Jalaa al-afhaam, as did his Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah in his tafseer (4/592).<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The third</span>: Acting in conformity to the angels, as mentioned in the previous aayah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The fourth</span>: The one sending salutations upon him receiving ten from Allaah.<br />Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh (no. 408) on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the messenger of Allaah sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said, ‘Whosoever  sends a prayer upon me, Allaah sends ten upon them.’<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The fifth</span>: They have ten rewards written for them.<br />This has been reported via some variant narrations of the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah mentioned in the last point. This was reported by Ahmad (2/262); Isma’eel al-Qaadi, in ‘The Virtues of Sending Salutations upon the prophet sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (no. 11); Abu Ya’laa (11/no. 6527); Ibn Hibbaan (3/no. 905) and its chain of narration is hassan.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The sixth</span>: They are raised ten levels.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The seventh</span>: They have ten sins forgiven.<br />An-Nasaa’ee reported in Amal al-Yaum wa’l Layla’, no. 62, with an authentic chain on the authority of Anas, on the prophet sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, ‘Whosoever sends a single salutation upon me, Allaah sends ten upon them; pardons them of ten sins and raises them ten levels.’<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The eighth</span>: It is a means by which the Allaah and the angels will send salutations upon them.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The ninth</span>: [it is a means by which one can] be taken out of the darkness and brought into the light.<br /><br />The Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, ‘Remembrance obligates Allaah’s and the angels’ salutations upon the one who remembers. And whomsoever Allaah and His angels send salutations upon have succeeded every success and achieved a great achievement. Allaah the Most High says, {It is He and His angels that send salutations upon you so that you may leave the darkness and enter the light}. So this sending of salutations from Allaah and His angels is a means by which they can be taken out of darkness and led to the light. And if they attain salutations from Allaah and His angels and they take them out from the darkness, leading them to the light, them what goodness have they failed to attain?! And what evil has not been repelled from them?! So woe unto those who are unmindful of their lord – how much of His virtue and beneficence have they been denied?! And with Allaah lies success.’<br /><br />I say: The slave can attain the salaat of Allaah and His angels if they send salaat upon His messenger sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam and then enter under the aayah, {It is He and His angels that send salutations upon you so that you may leave the darkness and enter the light}.<br /><br />I have a dedicated work, may Allaah facilitate its completion, regarding the means of leaving the darkness and being led into the light, entitled Fathun min al-‘Azeez al-Ghafoor.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The tenth</span>: That it is a means for making a sitting good and ensuring it does not return as a source of regret on the Day of Standing.<br /><br />Ibn Hibbaan reported in his Saheeh (3/no. 591) with a chain authentic  upon the conditions of Muslim, on the authority of Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said, ‘The messenger of Allaah sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said, “A people do not have a sitting in which they do not mention Allaah, or send salutations upon the prophet except that it will return on the Day of Standing as a source of regret, even if they enter the Jannah due to reward.”’<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The eleventh</span>: It is a means by which Allaah will raise the slave’s grief.<br />Reported by at-Tirmithi (2457); Ahmad (5/136); al-Haakim (2/153); Abd bin Humayd in al-Musnad (no. 170); Isma’eel al-Qaadi in ‘The Virtues of Sending Salutations upon the prophet sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (14); by his way as-Subkee in his Tabaqaat (1/173); Ibn Shaaheen in at-Targheeb wa’t Tarheeb (21) on the authority of Ubay bin K’ab, who said, ‘When a quarter of the night passed the messenger of Allaah sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said, ‘O people! Remember Allaah! Remember Allaah! The violent shaking after which the second blowing of the Trumpet has come. Death and that which is with it has come. Death and that which is with it has come.’ Ubay asked, ‘O messenger of Allaah, indeed, I send many salutations upon you. So how much of my prayers should I apportion for you?’ to which he said, ‘Whatever you wish.’ Ubay asked ‘A quarter?’ He replied, ‘Whatever you wish but if you increase, there is goodness in it.’ ‘A half?’ to which he replied, ‘Whatever you wish but if you increase, there is goodness in it.’ Ubay then said, ‘I will apportion all my prayer to you.’ To which the prophet replied, ‘Therefore your worries will be assured and your sins forgiven.’<br /><br />There is some debate with regards to its chain. Abdullah bin Muhammad bin ‘Aqeel has been declared weak by most but a group of the major a’imma, such as Ahmad, Ibn al-Madeeni and at-Tirmithi, have accepted him.<br /><br />The hadeeth has a supporting narration on the authority of Hibbaan bin Munqath, reported by at-Tabaraani (4/no. 3574). Its chain is hassan in supporting. See Mujma’ az-Zawaa’id (10/118).<br /><br />And the reason for Allaah’s sufficing the slave their worries is that Allaah sends salaah upon them due to their sending salaah upon His messenger sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The twelfth</span>: It guides the person who does it to path towards the Jannah and makes those who leave it stumble the path [towards Jannah].<br /><br />At-Taymee reported in at-Targheeb (1658 Zaghlool ed. &amp; 1685 Daar al-Hadeeth ed.); Ibn al-A’raabi in his Mu’jam (354); al-Bayhaqi in as-Sunan (9/286); in ash-Shu’ab (2/1574 – Zaghlool ed. &amp; 4/206 al-Hindiyyah ed.); in ad-Da’waatul al-Kabeer (154); Ibn Shaaheen in the fifth volume of al-Afraad (81); Ibn al-Jarraah in the fifth of al-Amaalee and ar-Rasheed al-Ataar; Abu Musa al-Madeeni in at-Targheeb, as noted in al-Qawl al-Badee’ (p. 146) with a hassan isnaad on the authority of abu Hurairah that the messenger of Allaah sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said, “Whosoever forgets to send salaah upon me will be hindered on the path to Jannah” and it is acceptable [Saalih] in witnessing.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The thirteenth</span>: It is a means by which Allaah will maintain good praise for the one who sends salutations upon him to those in the heavens and earth – as the one who sends salutations upon him is asking Allaah to laud His messenger, dignify and honour him. And the kind of reward that is given reflects the action done, so it is incumbent that the one who sends salaah upon the prophet will have a reward reflecting this.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The fourteenth</span>: It is a means by which the one sending the salaah can attain blessings in their selves, actions and their lives. It is a means by which they can attain rectification as they invoke their lord to shower blessings upon him and his family. And this is an invocation that is answered and reward reflects the type of action.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">The fifteenth</span>: it is a means by which Allaah’s mercy can be attained, as mercy is either the meaning of ‘salaah’, as one group [of the scholars] say, or from the requisites/necessary ramifications of it, as is the correct opinion. So the one who sends salaah upon him will achieve mercy upon them.<br /><br />And there are [other] fruits and blessings of sending the salaah upon him. Some are authentically narrated in the aathaar[2] and others, which are many, are derived through sound understanding, in conformity to the foundations of Ahlus Sunnah wa’l Jama’ah.<br /><br />And there are others narrated in ahadeeth that are weak and mursal that we shall mention in a future edition, may Allaah by His Favour and Grace facilitate it.<br /><br />And may peace and salutations be upon our prophet and his family and companions.<br /><br />[1] Al-Asaalah no. 17, pp 12-15<br /><br />[2] From them the narration on the authority of Abu Dardaa’, on the prophet sall Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, ‘Whosoever sends salaah upon me ten times when they reach the morning and ten when they reach the evening, my intercession will reach them on the Day of Standing’ – graded Hassan by Imaam al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ as-Sagheer (6357) [Translator’s Note]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/10/26/the-virtues-of-sending-salaah-upon-the-prophet-%EF%B7%BA-sheikh-mashhoor-hasan/">http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/10/26/the ... oor-hasan/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Sep 27, 2016 12:03 am</p><hr />
