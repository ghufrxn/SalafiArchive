				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Stoning To Death?</span></strong><br /><br />a). Sahih Bukhari<br /><br />Bukhari Volume 7, Book 63, Number 195:<br />Narrated Jabir:<br /><br />A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam(Maa’iz) came to the Prophet while he was in the mosque and said, &quot;I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.&quot; The Prophet turned his face to the other side. The man turned towards the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and gave four witnesses against himself. On that the Prophet called him and said, &quot;Are you insane?&quot; (He added), &quot;Are you married?&quot; The man said, 'Yes.&quot; On that the Prophet ordered him to be stoned to the death in the Musalla (a praying place). When the stones hit him with their sharp edges and he fled, but he was caught at Al-Harra and then killed<br /><br />b) Sahih Muslim<br /><br />In Saheeh Muslim Sahaba says &quot;We took him(Maa`iz) to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him.&quot; <em>[Sahih Muslim Book #017, Hadith #4202]</em><br /><br />c). Abu Dawud<br /><br />Another Hadith says &quot;They then went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and reported it(His running while stoning) to him. He said: Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah.<em>(Abu Dawud Book #38, Hadith #4405 Authenticated by Shaykh Al Bani, al-Hafiz Ibne Hajar Asqalani, al-Hakim,Dahabee see detail in the book &quot;Erwa al Ghulail hadith no: 2322 Vol 7 page 358).</em><br /><br />d) Jabir bin Abdullah ra said<br />Prophet peace be upon him said: Why did you not leave him alone and bring him to me? and he said this so that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) might ascertain it from him. But he did not say this to abandon the prescribed punishment.<em>[Abu Dawud Book# 38 hadith# 4406]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Commentaries.</span></strong><br /><br />a) Imam An Nawawi said<br />Imam Ash Shafiee and Ahmad and Others says that If he is agreeing that he did zina(after marriage) and if he is running while stoning, immediately he should be left alone..., Malik says in one of the narration that he should not be left alone and should be killed, Imam Ash Shafiee made the evidence from the narration of Sunan Abu Dawood where Prophet peace be uponhim said &quot;Why did you not leave him alone until Allah look into him &quot; and the narrations &quot;&quot;Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah&quot;<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Sharah an Nawawy, Book of Hudood Chapter on HE WHO CONFESSES HIS GUILT OF ADULTERY]</span></strong><br /><br />b) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:<br />It may be understood from this case – the case of Maa’iz when he confessed to having committed zina – that it is mustahabb for the one who falls into a similar sin to repent to Allaah and conceal his sin and not mention it to anyone, as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar said to Maa’iz. Whoever discovers anything of that nature should conceal it according to what we have mentioned; he should not expose it or refer the matter to the ruler, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in this story: “If you had concealed it with your garment it would have been better for you.” Hence al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If a person commits a sin and Allaah conceals it for him, I prefer for him to conceal it too and to repent,” and he quoted as evidence the story of Maa’iz with Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Fath al-Baari, 12/124, 125]</span></strong><br /><br />c) Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Raz mentioned<br />Another hadith says when Prophet peace be upon him heard that he ran away, he(peace be upon him) said &quot;Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah&quot;. This is the saying of Imam Shafiee and Ahlul hadeeth that If he is agreeing that he did zina(after marriage) and if he is running while stoning, immediately he should be left alone <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Commentary of Sahih Bukhari by Muhammad Dawud Raz checked by Shaykh Abds Salam Bastawi and Shaykh Abdul Jabbar Salafi Vol 7 page 51]</span></strong></div>
