<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Using the Athan to repel the Shayaateen</span></strong><br /><br />It was narrated that Suhail said: “My father sent me to Bani Harithah, and with me was a slave of ours- or a friend of ours. A voice called him by his name from behind a wall. The person with me looked over the wall, but could not see anything. I mentioned this to my father and he said: “If I had known that would happen to you, I would not have sent you. But next time, if you hear a voice (and don’t see anything), then give the call to prayer. I heard Abu Hurayrah narrating the Messenger of Allah (sallAllahu alayhi wa salam) said: “When the call to prayer is given, the Shaytan runs  away quickly.”<br /><br /><em>Muslim 858</em><br /><br />Benefits for this subject matter:<br /><ul>• ” If you hear a voice (and don’t see anything), then give the call to prayer…”  An-Nawawi said: ” It’s correct to say the athan that is used for calling to the prayer.( Al-Athkar 115)<br /><br />•Based on this hadeeth if anyone encounters something similar to what happened to this man,  then it is suitable for him to call the athan. Three points of benefit can be derived from this hadeeth.<br /><br />•-1- Shaytaan becomes visible to the Son of Adam to cause him harm. This is the disbelieving Jinn.<br /><br />•-2- Shaytaan’s harm and evil can be repelled by the Athan.<br /><br />•-3- Its permissible to call the Athan in other than its prescribed time, in order to drive the devil away. However calling the Athan for the prayer, can only be done at its fixed time.<br /><br />•Everyone who is afraid of Shaytaan should call the Athan.<br /><br />•Shaytaan flees from the Athan. (Al-Ilmul Hayyib by Badrud deen Al-’Aynee 855H)</ul><br /><strong><em>Translated and compiled b</em></strong>y<br />Abu Aaliyah Abdullah ibn Dwight Battle<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/09/29/using-the-athan-to-repel-the-shayaateen/">http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/09/29/usi ... hayaateen/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 3:53 pm</p><hr />
