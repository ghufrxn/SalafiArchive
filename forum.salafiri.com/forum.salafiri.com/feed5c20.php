The Mawlid Papers – Part 31 - The Legal Status of Mawlid Gatherings - Imam Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi (1320H) &amp; Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri (1353H)<br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />Question: What do you say about the Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times? Are they permissible or impermissible?<br /><br />Answer: The Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times are an innovation and it is not but except a bitter bid'ah. The gatherings that are organised are newly invented matters and every newly invented matter is an innovation. As for it being minor innovation then it is that such  gatherings did not exist during the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallams time, nor during the times of the companions, the successors or during the time of the Imams of Ijtihad, May Allah be pleased with them all.  Likewise and similarly such Mawlid gatherings are a hub and a concoction of evil and open corruption and its permissibility cannot be deduced from the Book of Allah nor from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam nor from Ijma or correct Qiyas and therefore it (these Mawlid gatherings) are are newly invented matters.<br /><br />As for it being a major innovation then the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, &quot;Beware of newly invented matters for verily every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.&quot; (Abu Dawud no.4607, Tirmidhi no.2676, Ibn Majah no.46, Ahmad 4:126,Mishkat 1:36)<br /><br />He also said, &quot;The worst of the affairs are the newly invented matters and every innovation is misguidance.&quot; (Muslim no.867)<br /><br />The Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith have authored numerous works and treatises on the Mawlid gatherings and in warning and censuring against it. The avid reader who wishes to read amore about this issue may refer to them and Allah knows best.&quot;<br /><br />Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain<br /><br />Written by Muhammad Abdur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri<br /><br />(Fatawa Nazariyyah (1:221), Majmu'a Fatawa Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri (pp.88-89)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2016 11:01 pm</p><hr />
