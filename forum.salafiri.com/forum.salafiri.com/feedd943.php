<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Do Not Say “Natural Disaster” Or “Mother Nature”</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muqbil (rahimahullaah)</em><br /><br />Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu ‘ala rasulullaah<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaikh Muqbil:</span></strong> Attributing earthquakes, rain, lightening, thunder, Tsunami to “nature” is Kufr!<br /><br />Five years ago, student of knowledge Abul Hasan Malik Aadam Al-Akhdar (hafidhahullaah) gave a class at Masjid Rahmah, reading to the attendees from a highly beneficial book Asbaabu Zilzaal(The Reasons for Earthquakes) written by Shaikh Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi’ee (rahimahullaah).<br /><br />In light of the recent earthquake that Allaah sent to the island of Haiti, inshaAllaah there is benefit in reading the following scholarly advice:<br /><br />So as for the one who tries to ascribe these matters to the nature, and he calls them ‘natural disasters’…if he intends by this that the nature itself is that which is causing these matters, then he is a Kaafir, a disbeliever.In a hadeeth Qudsi, the Prophet (sallaahu ‘alayhi wa salaam) said: He (Allaah) said: “This morning one of my slaves became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by virtue of Allaah and His mercy,’ that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by such-and-such a star,’ that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars.’“<br /><br />So Allaah has clarified here that the one who ascribes these matters – whether it be rain, lightening, thunder, the Tsunami, whatever it may be – if he attributes that to the creation, then he has disbelieved in Allaah.<br /><br />If a person says, for example, in describing an earthquake that the earth begins to do this and they begin to explain the actual way that the thing takes place, then this is a scientific explanation, but we understand that it is Allaah Who caused all of that to take place. That it is all from the Might of Allaah. So he does no ascribe that matter to the nature itself.<br /><br />Here is another daleel from Abul Hasan Malik’s lecture, in which he read from the book of Shaikh Muqbil (rahimahullaah) Asbaabu Zilzaal (The Reasons for Earthquakes).<br /><br />Because your Lord has inspired it.(Az-Zalzalah 99:5) Ibn Kathir (rahimahullaah) mentions with regards to this meaning, that the inspiration here is that Allaah commanded the earth to shake; that it is Allaah Who commanded the earth to move.And this is a refutation – as Shaykh Muqbil will get into – against those who attribute these calamities to the nature. They call them “natural disasters.” And as we will see from the speech of Shaykh Muqbil: If one actually says this believing that it is the earth or the nature itself that causes this matter, then he is a kaafir, disbeliever. He disbelieved that it is Allaah Who has caused this matter and caused this affair to take place with His infinite Wisdom.<br /><br />Source :http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=8&amp;Topic=10383<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Mar 26, 2017 10:17 pm</p><hr />
