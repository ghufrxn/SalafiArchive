However, that which is known to us and other than us who read about the affairs of the people is that these (deviant) sects are in existence and they are active in propogating their message. And because of this, it is imperative we study their opinions/views so that we know their falseness and know the truth (that we are upon) and refute those (of them) who discourse with us.<br /><br />Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen<br /><br /><em>Kitaabul-‘Ilm – Page 128, Question No.25</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://thesunnahway.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/the-benefit-of-learning-about-the-deviant-sects-by-shaykh-ibn-uthaymeen/">https://thesunnahway.wordpress.com/2011 ... uthaymeen/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2016 9:57 pm</p><hr />
