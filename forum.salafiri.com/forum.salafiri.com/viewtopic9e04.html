And it is possible that it could mean any crawling animal even if it does not kill, like insects.’<br /><br /><em>‘Evil eye’</em>: ‘From every evil type of affliction from the eye.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Taken from: ‘Tuhfahtul Ahawadhi’ an explanation of Sunan at-Tirmidhi]</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">How to Seek Refuge from the Evil Eye for Children</span></strong><br /><em>By the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani -Rahimullaah-</em><br /><br />Shaykh al-Albaani was asked over the phone:<br /><br />Phone rings.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       yes!<br /><br />Caller:                  Aslaamu alaykum.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       Wa alaykum as-Salaam.<br /><br />Caller:         O Shaykh regarding ‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’ Is this said three consecutive times or just once?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       No, it is mentioned once, however if it appears to the one saying this Dua’ that he needs to repeat it without specifying three times, then there is no problem with that.<br /><br />Caller:         and should he place his hand on the head of the one sought refuge for?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       Yes, yes!<br /><br />Caller:         Even in congregation, if it is a group of children together, how can he place his hand upon all of them?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       He should place his two hands on two of the children, then repeat this on the rest of the children.<br /><br />Caller:         Right hand and left hand, with both hands?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       Yes, yes.<br /><br />Caller:                  Regarding the hadeeth that the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–<br /><br />would not sleep until he recited Soorah Mulk, al – Isra, Zumar, and Sajdah, is this when he lies down on his bed at night, or before he lies down?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span>       What is important is that he recites before he falls asleep, whether it is whilst he is sitting or lying then it is up to him’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Silsilah Huda wa Noor’ tape No. 323 at 3:42mins]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/seeking-refuge-from-the-evil-eye-for-children/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... -children/</a><!-- m --></div>
