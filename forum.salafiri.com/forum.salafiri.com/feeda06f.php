I [Salih, the son of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal] asked my father regarding someone who forgot to rinse his mouth and nose [whilst doing his Wudhoo, and did not remember] until he [had already] begun praying Salaah?<br /><br />He [Imam Ahmad] responded: He must return to rinse his mouth and nose, and repeat his Salaah.<br /><br /><em>Reference: Masaa`il of Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal narrated on the authority of his son Imam Abul-Fadal, Salih bin Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal – Page 28</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] He is Abul-Fadl Salih bin Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal. Born 203 AH, he narrated from his father Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ali bin Al-Waleed At-Tayalsee, and Ibrahim bin Al-Fadl Az-Zaa`ri. Those who narrated from him include: His son Zuhair, Imam Abul-Qasim Al-Baghawee, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abee Haatim [also a student of Imam Salih bin Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal] when asked about him said: ‘I wrote down narrations from him in Asbahaan, and he is Thiqaah [trustworthy] and Sadooq [truthful].` Imam Saleh bin Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal died in Asbahaan, during the month of Ramadan, in the year 266 AH at the age of 63. He was buried near the, Sahabi of the Messenger of Allah Hamamah bin Abee Hamamah Ad-Dawsee. Refer to ‘At-Tabaqaat` of Imam Ibn Abee Ya`laa, volume 1/173-176.<br /><br />[2] He is Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal bin Hilaal bin Asad bin Idrees bin Abdullah bin Hayyan bin Abdullah bin Anas bin Awf bin Qaasit bin Maazin bin Shaybaan As-Shaybaanee. He was born in Rabiul-Al-Awwal in the year 164 AH. His father died when he was young, after which his mother took care of him and his education. He began seeking knowledge with the scholars of Baghdad, Iraq, and started seeking knowledge of Hadeeth at the age of sixteen. His search for knowledge led him to Kufa, Basra, Makkah, Madeenah, Yemen, and Shaam.. From the great scholars who praised him include, Imam Shaafee, Imam Abu Ubaidil-Qaasim, and Imam Ibrahim Al-Harbee. He died on Friday 12th Rabiul-Awwal in the year 241 AH.
