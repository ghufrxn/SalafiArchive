				<div class="content">(2) The Basis of the Salafee  Call and Its Restriction<br /><br />Imaam  adh-Dhahabee (rahimahullāh)  said  in  the  introduction  to his book al-’Uluww li’l-’Aliyy al-Ghaffār’:<br />“O ’ Abdullāh, If you love justice then  stop at the texts of the Qur’ān and Sunan and then look at what the Companions  and the Tābi’ūn stated along with the commentaries of the Imāms of tafsīr with  regards  to  the  verses  and  with  whatever  has  been  related  from  the  madhab  of   the  Salaf.  So  either  you  speak  with  knowledge  or  you  remain  silent  with  gentleness.” (Refer to Wasitiyyyah Ahlus Sunnah Baynal Firaq  pgs. 102-103. <br /><br />Pay  attention,  it  is  obligatory,  no  doubt,  that  the  caller  call  to  and  stop at the Quran, Sunnah and salaf. Look carefully and you will see in  the  words  of   Dhahabee  the  restriction  and  not  going  beyond  this  and it is therefore necessary that we explain this dawah to the masses in the  kindest way. Contra, It is a major sin if  we attempt to water down, hide  or appease this dawah with that which is falsehood. <br />Look  carefully  again  at  the  words  of   Dhahabee  and  you  will  see that a condition he placed is that the caller must have knowledge of  that which  he  calls  to  and  by  this  it  is  as  clear  as  the  sun  that  he  is  placing the importance upon the obligation of  consulting, taking advise of  and referring to the scholars. <br /><br />A dawah which does not refer to scholars for its knowledge is like the  one  who  expects  a  response  from  a  donkey  when  it  asks  it  how  its affairs are! Impossible! That is, it is a dawah that cannot possibly succeed and instead the dawah becomes open to the interpretations of  the juhaal  (ignorant) and ruwaybidah (those unfit to give knowledge).</div>
