				<div class="content">[6] Question: What are the books you recommend a young person that is starting out in his Islaamic studies to read?<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />If he is a novice, then from the books of Fiqh, we advise him to read “Fiqh As-Sunnah” of Sayyid Saabiq, while seeking assistance from some of its references, such as “Subul-us-Salaam (the ways of Peace &amp; Safety) “ (of Imaam As-Sana’aanee, rahimahullaah). And if he looks into “Tamaam-ul-Mannah” (of Al-Albaanee) then that will be stronger for him.<br /><br />And I advise him to read “Ar-Rawdat-un-Nadiyyah” (of Sideeq Hasan Khaan).<br /><br />As for the subject of Tafseer, then he should habitually read from the book“Tafseer Al-Qur’aan-ul-‘Adheem” of Ibn Katheer – [chm file download ]even though it is somewhat long – for it is the most authentic from the books of Tafseer today.<br /><br />Then, on the subject of religious exhortation and heart-softening narrations, he should read the book “Riyaad-us-Saaliheen” of Imaam An-Nawawee. [Daeef hadeeth in Riyadh us Saleheen – Albanee]<br /><br />Then, with regard to the books related to Creed, I advise him to read the book“Sharh Al-‘Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah” of Ibn Abee Al-‘Izz Al-Hanafee. And he should seek assistance, also, from my comments and explanations to it.<br /><br />Then, he should make it his customary practice to study from the books of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and his student Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah, may Allaah have mercy on them. For I hold them to be from the rare and unique Muslim scholars that have treaded upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors) in their understanding, while having Taqwaa and righteousness. And we do not purify anyone over Allaah.<br /><br />[Al-Asaalah, Issue #5][Source al-manhaj]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/15/albaneerecommended/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/15/a ... commended/</a><!-- m --></div>
