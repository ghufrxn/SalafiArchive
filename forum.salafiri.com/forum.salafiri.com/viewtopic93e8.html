				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0040FF">Easy Phrases of Dhikr (Remembrance) for After the Prayer</span></span></strong><br /><br />Here are some easy phrases of thikr (remembrance) for after the prayer, especially for children who are learning to pray:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">1 – Saying: Subhaan Allaah (10x), al-Hamdulillaah (10x), Allaahu akbar (10x) after the prayer.<br /><br />سُبْحَانَ اللهِ – الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ – اللهُ أَكْبَرُ</span></strong><br /><br />This is something very easy that few people do that would wipe away 2,500 sins a day (combined with one other act)!<br /><br />On the authority of ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-’Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father), the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) said (what means):<br /><br />“There are two traits that no Muslim servant guards over except that he will enter Paradise (by way of them) – Nay, they are so easy, yet those who do them are few – :<br /><br />(a) Glorifying Allaah (saying “Subhaan Allaah“) after each prayer ten times, praising Him (saying “al-Hamdulillaah“) ten times, and declaring His Greatness (saying “Allaahu akbar“) ten times – that is 150 on the tongue and 1,500 in the Scale -<br /><br />(b) Declaring Allaah’s Greatness (saying “Allaahu akbar“) 34 times when laying down, praising Him (saying “al-Hamdulillaah“) 33 times, and glorifying Him (saying “subhaan Allaah“) 33 times – that is 100 on the tongue and 1,000 in the Scale -<br /><br />And which one of you does 2,500 bad deeds in one day?!”<br /><br />This hadeeth was collected by Imaam Ahmad, the four compilers of the Sunan, and others.  Shaykh Al-Albaanee called it “saheeh” in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (#3230).<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">2 – Saying “Astaghfirullaah” (3x), and then ”Allaahumma antas-Salaamu wa minkas-Salaamu tabaarakta thal-Jalaali wal-Ikraam“<br /><br /> أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ<br /><br /> اللهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلاَمُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلاَمُ تَبَارَكْتَ ذَا الْجَلاَلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</span></strong><br /><br />On the authority of Thowbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him): The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) used to seek Allaah’s Forgiveness (saying “Astaghfirullaah“) three times when finishing his prayer, and then he would say (what means):<br /><br />“Allaahumma antas-Salaamu wa minkas-Salaamu tabaarakta thal-Jalaali wal-Ikraam” (“O Allaah you are as-Salaam – the One who grants peace – and from You alone is peace, blessed be You, O Possessor of Majesty and Grace!”)<br /><br />It was collected by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh (#591).<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">3 – “Allaahumma a’in-nee ‘alaa thikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ebaadatika”<br /><br /> اللهُمَّ أَعِنِّي عَلَى ذِكْرِكَ وَشُكْرِكَ وَحُسْنِ عِبَادَتِكَ<br /></span></strong><br />Mu’aath ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: One day, the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) took my hand and said (what means):<br /><br />“O Mu’aath! Verily I love you!”<br /><br />Mu’aath replied, “(I would ransom) my father for you, and my mother, O Messenger of Allaah! And I love you!”<br /><br />The Messenger of Allaah then said (what means):<br /><br />“I advise you – O Mu’aath – not to leave off saying after each prayer: Allaahumma a’in-nee ‘alaa thikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ebaadatika (“O Allaah! Help me to remember you, thank you, and worship you in a good way!”)”<br /><br />It was collected by Imaams Ahmad, Aboo Daawood, al-Haakim and others. It was authenticated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, and also by Shaykh al-Albaanee in Saheeh Sunan Abee Daawood (#1362).<br /><br />This hadeeth is just beautiful!  From the most important benefits of it is that true love for the sake of Allaah (may Allaah bless us with it) causes those who love each other to advise each other with things that please Allaah.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF0000">FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFIT:</span></span></strong><br /><br />More than one person has asked me about the thikr said 10 times after the prayer: What about 33 times? Is that wrong?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">The answer:</span></strong> Not at all. There are many different ways to make thikr after prayer. Saying them 33 times each is an authentically established Sunnah, collected by both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.<br /><br />So they are both Sunnah. However, the objective of this article is to highlight some of the easiest phrases for children when they first learn to pray. I suggested this one instead of the 33 times, because its easier and some children at age seven may have difficulty in counting to 33.<br /><br />And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />I was also asked about what some people claim is established in Saheeh Muslim, that eleven times each is also established.<br /><br />The answer: This is based on a misreading of a narration in Saheeh Muslim(#595).  Imam Muslim was identifying a misunderstanding added to the hadeeth by one of the narrators, Suhayl ibn Abee Saalih.  He mistakenly understood that the hadeeth of saying these phrases 33 times meant in total, and so we should say each of the three eleven times each.  The scholars (beginning with Imaam Muslim) have identified this as a personal mistake of Suhayl, and something not to be taken as part of the hadeeth itself.<br /><br />Al-Haafith Ibn Hajr concludes: “It is more apparent that the meaning is each of them get that (33 times) seperately.” (Fat-hul-Baaree, 2/328)<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Alee ibn Aadam al-Ityoobee said, “This (11x) was the misunderstanding of Suhayl when explaining the meaning of 33 times, he assumed that the 33 times should be divided over the three phrases.  What is correct is that each of the three phrases are to be said 33 times each, Subhaan Allaah (33), al-Hamdulillaah (33), and Allaahu akbar (33), 99 all togther, not 33 all together.” (al-Bahr al-Muheet ath-Thajjaaj, 13/239)<br /><br />And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://researchcenterforhadith.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/easy-phrases-of-dhikr-remembrance-for-after-the-prayer/" class="postlink">http://researchcenterforhadith.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/easy-phrases-of-dhikr-remembrance-for-after-the-prayer/</a></div>
