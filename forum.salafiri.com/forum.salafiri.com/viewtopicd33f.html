He is from the people of the fire on the Day of Judgement.<br /><br />2. <span style="color: #FF0000">The Mushrik</span>, he does not deny the existence of Allah تعالى but associates patners with Allah and thus seeks the anger of Allah تعالى by giving Allah's right of worship, his lordship and qualities and attributes to other than Allah. He is also from Ahlul Naar, the people of the fire.<br /><br />3. <span style="color: #FF0000">The Mustaslim or Muslim</span>, this is the one upon haq. He denies the existence of any deity being worthy of worship, makes kufr of taghoot and is firm upon the tawheed of Allah. On the Day of Judgement he will be the only one to enter Jannah.<br /><br />From the notes of Abu Ishaq Jalal Zulfiqar taken from <span style="color: #FF0000"><em>Sharh Sareeh as-Sunnah of ash-Shaykh Abdul Aziz al-Raajihi (حفظه الله)</em></span></div>
