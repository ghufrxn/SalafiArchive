You are a wrong doer but you see yourself as a good doer, and you are an ignorant person but you see yourself as a scholar, and you are stingy but you see yourself as generous, and (you are) a fool but you see yourself an intelligent one, your time is short but your hopes are big.</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Imam Ath-Thahabi said, commenting on this statement:</span></strong><br /><br /><em>    Yes! By Allah, He spoke the truth, and you are an oppressor but you see yourself as oppressed, and (you are) a consumer of unlawful things and you see yourself as pious, and (you are) a evil doer but you see yourself as upright (in your actions), and (you are) a seeker of knowledge for this world and you see yourself as a seeking it for Allah.</em><br /><br /><em>Taken from Siyar A'lam an-Nubala.<br />Translated by Hussain Suleman Abdul Sattar.</em></div>
