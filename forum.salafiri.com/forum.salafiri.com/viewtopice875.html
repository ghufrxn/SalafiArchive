Proofs:<br /><br /><ul>مَا أَنْهَرَ الدَّمَ وَذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ فَكُلْ، لَيْسَ الظُّفُرَ وَالسِّنَّ، أَمَّا الظُّفُرُ فَمُدَى الْحَبَشَةِ، وَأَمَّا السِّنُّ فَعَظْمٌ<br /><br />“Whatever makes the blood flow and Allah’s name is mentioned on it eat, not a nail or tooth, as for the nail it is the knife of the Abyssinian and the tooth is a bone”</ul><br />[Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim]<br /><br />Imam Nawawi rahimahullah said:<br /><br /><ul>في هذا الحديث تصريح بجواز الذبح بكل محدد يقطع إلا الظفر والسن وسائر العظام ، فيدخل في ذلك السيف والسكين والسنان والحجر والخشب والزجاج والقصب والخزف والنحاس وسائر الأشياء المحددة<br /><br />“In this hadith is clarity in the permissibility of slaughtering with any sharp object that cuts except for the bone or tooth and all other bones, so included in that is the sword, knife, spears, rock, wood, glass, sugar cane, ceramic, brass and all other sharp things”</ul><br />[Sharh Saheeh Muslim (13/123)]<br /><br />In fact there is another wording of the Hadith it states:<br /><br /><ul>أنهر الدم بما شئت، و اذكر اسم الله عليه<br /><br />Let the blood flow with whatever you want and mention Allah’s name over it.</ul><br />[Saheeh Jami’ no.2519]<br /><br />So machine as a tool is halal. The Permanent committee have passed a fatwa saying it is allowed:<br /><br />    <ul>Secondly, using machines for slaughtering animals whose flesh is permissible to eat according to Shari`ah does not differ from slaughtering them using a knife. Hence, whosoever presses the on button by whatever means and mentions the Name of Allah Alone, it is Halal to eat their slaughtered animals, be they Muslims, Jews, or Christians. This is because any animal whose blood is caused to flow and Allah’s Name is mentioned over it is Halal to eat except what is slaughtered using teeth and nails.</ul><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br /><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3136&amp;PageID=8661&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=8810&amp;MarkIndex=4&amp;0" class="postlink">[Reference]</a><br /><br />And:<br /><br /><ul>    Q 1: The company intends to buy an automatic slaughtering machine instead of doing this job manually, because there are too many animals to slaughter. Is this permissible?</ul><br /><ul>    A: It is permissible for you to buy an automatic machine to slaughter edible animals.</ul><br /><a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=7&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=8696" class="postlink">[Reference]</a><br /><br />And Allah Knows Best<br /><br />Faisal Ibn Abdul Qaadir Ibn Hassan<br />Abu Sulaymaan<br /><br />—<br /><br />The Permanent Committee (lajnah) were asked:<br /><br /><ul>    Q 2: Is it enough to mention Allah’s Name once when running the machine, as it makes only one movement?</ul><br /><ul>    A: It is enough to mention Allah’s Name once by the person who runs the machine to slaughter many animals at the same time, provided that this person is a Muslim, Jewish or Christian.</ul><br />    May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br /><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3137&amp;PageID=8696&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=8859&amp;MarkIndex=9&amp;0" class="postlink">[Reference]</a><br /><br />—<br /><br />Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad was asked:<br /><br />Question:<br /><br />The questioner from Britain says: We have with us slaughtered chicken that is electrocuted by way of water, so the chicken is stunned and then slaughtered. Is this allowed to eat?<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />“If it does not die by this stunning. If it dies it is dead meat, not allowed. If it is simply stunned and life still remains, then there is no harm in that. As long as it does not die and it is only stunned. If the stunning causes death, then it is not allowed because it is dead meat . If it does not cause death and life still remains, but due to the stunning it does not have the strength that it had before stunning, then there is no harm in that”<br /><br />[Sharh Sunan Ibn Majah no. 292]<br /><br />Translated by<br /><br />Faisal Ibn Abdul Qaadir Ibn Hassan<br />Abu Sulaymaan<br /><br />Also the Lajnah said:<br /><br />    Q 1: There are many factories that slaughter chickens here in Mauritius. During the process, the workers put the chickens in hot water to remove the feathers before they remove the innards. This causes the waste inside the chicken to be mixed with the meat. Is this meat considered to be Halal (lawful) to eat?<br /><br />    A: This meat is considered to be Halal to eat. Placing the chickens in hot water after slaughtering has no effect on the permissibility of eating their meat. However, it is obligatory to delay putting the chickens in water until they have stopped moving completely.<br /><br /><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3154&amp;PageID=8708&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=8873&amp;MarkIndex=0&amp;0" class="postlink">[Reference]</a><br /><br />Mentioned by<br /><br />Faisal Ibn Abdul Qaadir Ibn Hassan<br />Abu Sulaymaan<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://torontodawah.com/?p=6989">http://torontodawah.com/?p=6989</a><!-- m --></div>
