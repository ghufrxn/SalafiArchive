			<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Fatawa – Duha Prayer</span></span></strong><br /><br />Source: alifta.net Permanent Committee Fatwas<br /><br /><strong>Ruling on Salat-ul-Duha and the number of its Rak`ahs</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 9: Is it permissible to offer Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) in four or six Rak`ahs (units of Prayer) with one Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</strong><br /><br />A: salat-ul-Duha is an act of Sunnah (reported from the Prophet) and its minimum is two Rak`ahs and it has no maximum limit. However, it is preferable not to exceed eight Rak`ahs and to say Taslim after each pair of Rak`ahs. Furthermore, they should not be combined with one Taslim at the end, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The (optional) Salah (Prayer) by night and day should consist of pairs of Rak`ahs.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Salah of Al-Awwabin</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 2: is there a Salah (Prayer) called the Salah of the penitent, and when is it offered?</strong><br /><br />A: This was reported regarding Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise). Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated, The Salah of those who are penitent is offered when your Fisal (weaned camels) feel the heat of the sun. Related by Muslim.<br /><br />This means at the time when the young camels’ hoofs are burnt by the sun.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Waiting in the Masjid until the sun rises and then offering Salat-ul-Duha</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q2: A man sits in the mosque reading the Qur’an after praying Al-Fajr Salah (Dawn Prayer) until sunrise, then he prays two Rak`ahs. However, some people denied his deed and said: It is impermissible, because it is the tradition of the worshippers of the Sun. Please, advise! Mat Allah reward you!</strong><br /><br />Answer2: Whoever sits in the mosque reading the Qur’an and reciting the formulas of Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) after praying Al-Fajr Salah (Dawn Prayer) until sunrise is clear and the time when Salah is forbidden is over and prays two Rak`ahs or what he could, he indeed does a good and great deed. His act agrees with the Sunnah and is rewarded, God willing. In support of this, it is reported on the authority of Anas Ibn Malik: ()may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah said: ‘Whoever prays the morning prayer in congregation then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two units of prayer has the reward like that of Hajj and `Umrah.'” rt No : 6,Page No:147)<br /><br />The Messenger of Allah (May Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon him) said:‘Completely, completely, completely’ Recorded by Al-Tirmidhy who said: It is Hadith Hasan Gharib (a good Hadith that is strange to come from this chain of narration) from Sahl Ibn Mu`adh from his father (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (May Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon him) said: “If anyone sits in his place of prayer when he finishes the dawn prayer till he prays the two Rak’ahs of the forenoon, saying nothing but what is good, his sins will be forgiven even if they are more than the foam of the sea”.Recorded by Al-Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud. According to another narration:His would be Paradise The same narration is recorded by Al-Bayhaqy but he added in the end of the report: “Hellfire will never touch his skin.” The report has many supporting tarditions that back its authority and is also strengthened with the report of Jabir Ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) that The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sit crossed legged after the Fajr (dawn) Prayer in the same place in which he had prayed till the sunrise is complete. Recorded by Imam Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Collection of Hadith, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, and Al-Nasa`y. The denial expressed by some people aginst his man is baseless denial and only ignorant people may deny this act.( Part No : 6,Page No:148)<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his Family, and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>The best time for offering Salat-ul-Duha</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 1: It is narrated in a Hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: Whoever prays the congregational Salah ‘Prayer’ of Fajr ‘Dawn’, then sits ‘in the Masjid [mosque]’ doing Dhikr ‘Remembrance of Allah’ until sunrise, then prays two Rak`ahs ‘units of prayer’, receives a complete reward of Hajj and `Umrah ‘lesser pilgrimage’. My question here is whether these two Rak`ahs are considered a part of Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) which is to be performed in eight Rak`ahs, or are they another independent Nafilah (supererogatory) Prayer?</strong><br /><br />A: The two Rak`ahs which are mentioned in this Hadith are considered a part of Salat-ul-Duha though they have special merit due to being linked to sitting in the Masjid until sunrise. on the other hand, the best time for offering Salat-ul-Duha is when it becomes very hot in the forenoon.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Should someone who offers Salah then returns home and offers Salat-ul-Duha there take the reward of a person who sits in the Masjid?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q: I usually offer Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in the Masjid (mosque) and after that I go ( Part No : 6,Page No:149) home and engage myself in reciting the Qur’an until the shade of sun is as the length of two spears. Then I perform ten Rak`ahs with the intention of Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise). This is my habit everyday, Praise be to Allah. But one of my colleagues, may Allah reward him, brought my attention to the following: The meaning of the Hadith which reads: He used to sit in his praying place until the sun had risen Therefore, I ask Your Eminence: Shall I have the reward in this condition or should I sit in the Masjid? Could you kindly advise? May Allah reward you! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</strong><br /><br />A: Your recitation of the Qur’an and offering Salat-ul-Dhuha after the time of prohibition are good but what was reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) is that he used to sit in the Masjid after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer. Imam Muslim related in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir ibn Hamzah (may Allah be pleased with him) that: Whenever the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) observed the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he used to set at the place of worship till the sun had risen enough. This action is considered as extension to Salah because of what was authentically reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The angels ask for blessings on each one of you as long as he is in the place where he has prayed and has not discharged anything. They say: O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him. ( Part No : 6,Page No:150)<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Whether someone who leaves the Masjid after the Fajr Prayer to perform Wudu’ again then returns to it should take the reward of a person sitting in the Masjid</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 2: If a person stays in the Masjid (mosque) to remember Allah after performing Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, then enters the state of minor impurity and goes to perform ablution, does his leaving the Masjid deprive him of the reward of doing Hajj and `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) if he returns to the Masjid then offers Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) as mentioned in the Hadith?</strong><br /><br />A: If the person who sits in the Masjid after offering Fajr Prayer to make remembrance of Allah till sunrise enters the state of minor ritual impurity, then leaves the Masjid to perform ablution, returns soon to the Masjid without staying long outside the Masjid, then offers two Rak`ahs after sunrise, his leaving the Masjid does not deprive him of the great reward of offering this act of worship, that is, making perfect Hajj and `Umrah and entering Paradise, Allah Willing. The Hadith that indicates this is reported by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:Whoever offers Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in congregation then sits for the remembrance of Allah till sunrise, then offers two Rak`ahs (units of Prayer), will have the reward of making perfect Hajj and `Umrah)<br /><br />he added that Allah’s Messenger repeated the word ‘perfect’ thrice. Related by Al-Tirmidhy in (Al-Jame`) and he said, ‘This is a Hadith Hasan Gharib (a good Hadith that is strange to come from this chain of narration)’. Al-Tabarany related a similar narration with a good Isnad (chain of narrators)<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Salat-ul-Duha for the traveller</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 2: Is it permissible for me to offer Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) even if I travelled to one of the Arab countries and stayed there for a while?</strong><br /><br />A: It is Mustahab (desirable) to offer salat-ul-Duha, whether you are a traveler or not, at least two Rak`ahs. It is to be offered from after the sun rises, until it reaches the middle of the sky.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Whether a traveler is obligated to offer Salat-ul-Duha</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 4: is it permissible for a traveler not to perform Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) like other Nawafil (supererogatory prayers), or should it be performed while on a journey? Should one recite the Qur’an in Salat-ul-Duha audibly or inaudibly? How many Rak`ahs should be offered, and what is the best time for performing it?</strong><br /><br />A: Salat-ul-Duha is a recommended not obligatory Salah, and it is not a Sunnah Ratibah (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis). It is recommended in many authentic Hadiths reported from the Prophet( Part No : 6,Page No:152)<br /><br />(peace be upon him), but it was not established that he (peace be upon him) offered it on a continuous basis. It was authentically reported that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) offered four Rak`ahs in the Duha prayer and might add to them whatever Allah willed. Narrated by Muslim on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). The word “offered” does not indicate that the Prophet continuously performed Salat-ul-Duha based on what she (may Allah be pleased with her) said when she was asked if the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to observe Duha (Salat-ul-Duha) prayer. She said, “No, only when he came back from travel. Related by Muslim. The linguistic meaning of the word “offered” does not indicate constancy. However, this does not contradict her (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: I have never seen the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) offering the supererogatory Duha prayer, but I offer it. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In fact, she (may Allah be pleased with her) negated seeing Allah’s Messenger offering Duha, and performed Duha on the basis of what she knew of the reward of Duha and the act of the Prophet (peace be upon him). As a result, the wordings narrated on her authority are consistent. As for the number of Rak`ahs of Duha Prayer, it is from two to eight Rak`ahs. Also, it is not preferable to recite the Qur’an audibly while offering Duha. Concerning the time for offering Duha, there is a Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) that ( Part No : 6,Page No:153)<br /><br />Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The Salah (prayer) of those who are penitent is offered when the weaned camels feel the heat of the sun.Related by Muslim. The Hadith means the time when the hoofs of young camels are harmed by the scorching heat caused by the intense rays of the sun on the sand. It is reported in the Two Sahihs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim’s Books of Authentic Hadith) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) recommended Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) to observe the two Rak`ahs of Duha. As for the virtue of Duha Prayer, it is narrated in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) to offer it, as well as Muslim’s narration on the authority of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Each morning, there is a charity due from every bone in the body of every one of you. Each utterance of Allah’s glorification (i.e. Subhana Allah) is an act of charity, every utterance of praise (i.e. Al-hamdu-lillah) is an act of charity, every utterance of affirmation of His Oneness (i.e. La Ilaha Illa Allah) is an act of charity, every utterance of affirmation of His Greatness (i.e. Allahu Akbar) is an act of charity, and enjoining right and forbidding evil is an act of charity. It suffices for all of this to offer two Rak`ahs of Duha.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Salah of Al-Awwabin</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q 5: Is there a two-Rak‘ahs Salah (two-unit-Prayer) called the Salah of Al-Awwabin (Prayer of the Oft-Repentant) that is performed after the supererogatory Salah for the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer? Surahs Al-Fatihah and Al-Zalzalah are recited in each Rak‘ah (unit of Prayer) 15 times and those who perform it regularly are recorded among Al-Awwabin (the oft-repentant). May Allah grant you a long life!</strong><br /><br />A: salah of Al-Awwabin is Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise), which is performed (at the time of the day) when the sun’s heat becomes intense. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The Salah of Al-Awwabin is when the feet of young camels are scalded (by the heat of sand).” It signifies the time when the sand heated by the sun becomes unbearably hot for the feet of young camels. As for offering Salah after the supererogatory Salah for the Maghrib Prayer in which Surahs Al-Fatihah and Al-Zalzalah are recited 15 times, we know of no basis for this.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions!<br /><br />_________________________<br /><br /><strong>Salah of Al-Awwabin</strong><br /><br /><strong>Q: We heard that after the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer, there is a two-Rak`ah (units of Prayer) Salah offered called “Salah of the penitent”. Is it a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet)? How is it offered?</strong><br /><br />A: the Sunnah Ratibah (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) offered after the Maghrib Prayer is two Rak`ahs, and then a person may offer any number of Rak`ahs they like. As for the two-Rak`ah Salah called “Salah of the penitent”, it is groundless.<br /><br />It rather refers to Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) which is offered when it becomes too hot, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), The Salah of the penitent is offered when your Fisal (weaned camels) feel the heat of the sun. Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/18/fatawa-duha/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/18/fatawa-duha/</a><!-- m --></div>
