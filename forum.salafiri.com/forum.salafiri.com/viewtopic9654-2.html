So what is your opinion about his explanations and what is your advice to these youth?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Answer:</span></strong> “In reality, I did not read anything from the books of the Shaikh. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">However, I read a little from his explanation of Aqeedatul Waasitiyyah and I was amazed with an utmost amazement with what he established in that explanation. Jazahullahu Khairan.</span></strong> All praise is due to Allah, we teach here this explanation and we also teach his book on Usool ul-Fiqh, Qawaaid ul-Muthla, Explanation of Three Fundamental Principles, and his explanation of the Luma’atul ‘Itiqaad. What is important is that Allah gave him a strength in what relates to Aqeedah and fiqh. Sometimes he relies upon some weak Ahaadith and he keeps quiet about them. We advise our brothers to benefit from his books. Jazahullahu Khairan”.<br /><br />[http://muqbel.net/fatwa.php?fatwa_id=1551]<br /><br />Translated by<br /><br />Faisal Ibn Abdul Qaadir Ibn Hassan<br />Abu Sulaymaan<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://darussaafi.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/the-ruling-on-reading-the-books-of-shaikh-ibn-ul-uthaymeen-shaikh-muqbil-ibn-haadi-al-waadiee/">https://darussaafi.wordpress.com/2015/0 ... l-waadiee/</a><!-- m --></div>
