Imam Khattabi said, &quot;<strong>The Ashab as-Sunan are the Ahlul Hadith.</strong>&quot; <br /><br /><em>Sha'rani, Mizan Kubra vol.1 pg no.46</em><br /><br />Imam Qa'nabi said that Imam Malik was crying when he was on his death bed. I asked him, &quot;<strong>Why are you crying for?&quot; He replied by saying, &quot;Why shouldn't I cry? I have given so many fatwas based on opinion. Oh how I wish I didn't do that! Today I am feeling sorrowful because of it. I would prefer that I am whipped once for each fatwa that I gave which was based on opinion so that I am omitted (from ever having done that).</strong>&quot;<br /><br /><em>Ibn Khalikan 2/11</em><br /><br />Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Muflih al-Maqdasi said, &quot;<strong>The Ahlul Hadith are the saved group who are upon the truth.</strong>&quot; <br /><br /><em>al-Aadaab ash-Shar'iah 1/266</em><br /><br />Abu Bakr Ibn Ayash said, &quot;<strong>The Ahlul Hadith will be present in all eras.</strong>&quot;<br /><br /><em>Mizan Sha'rani 1/48</em><br /><br />Imam Hakim narrates the saying of Imam Ahmad Ibn Sinan al-Wasiti with a Sahih Isnad that, &quot;<strong>There is no innovator in the world except that he hates the Ahlul Hadith.</strong>&quot;<br /><br /><em>Ma'rifatu Ulum ul-Hadith no.6<br /></em><br />Imam Abu Dawud's son Imam Abu Bakr advises that, &quot;<strong>And do not become like those people who play with their religion otherwise you will end up insulting, slandering and stigmatising the Ahlul Hadith.</strong>&quot;<br /><br /><em>ash-Shar'ia of al-Aajuri pg no.738 </em><br /><br />Ibn Hibban defined the Ahlul Hadith as, &quot;<strong>The Ahlul Hadith act upon the Sunnah, they defend the Sunnah and they destroy, exterminate and suppress those who oppose them.</strong>&quot; <br /><br /><em>Sahih Ibn Hibban pg no.1056, under Hadith no.6129 </em><br /><br />Allamah Ahmad Ibn Bashar al-Maqdasi (died 374 Hijri) visited Sindh in the Indian Subcontinent. He said about it that, &quot;<strong>Most of the people here were Ahlul Hadith.</strong>&quot; <br /><br /><em>Ahsan Ataqasim Fi Ma'rifatul Aqalim pg no.48 </em><br /><br />Translated by Abu Ubaydah<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=59">Abu Ubaydah</a> â€” Sun Jan 22, 2017 11:56 am</p><hr />
