So let them say what they want, for my sins are many, and perhaps because of their slander, my sins will be lightened for me and instead fall upon their shoulders.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://rahmaniyyahpublishing.wordpress.com/general-benefits/let-my-enemies-say-what-they-want-a-weighty-reminder-from-our-shaykh-the-muhaddith-of-the-lands-of-yemen-muqbil-ibn-hadi-al-wadii-may-allah-bestow-his-mercy-upon-him/">https://rahmaniyyahpublishing.wordpress ... -upon-him/</a><!-- m --></div>
