I bear witness that You are above the Throne, above the seventh heaven and it is not as your enemies, the zanaadiqah (heretics) say.&quot;</em><br /><br />Muhammad bin Mus'ab was one of the pious worshipers and reciters, he was praised by Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal who described him with being upon the Sunnah, and Abu al-Hasan al-Attaar narrated from him. He was thiqah, and a reciter of the Book of Allaah. He died in 228H, refer to Taareekh Bagdhaad (3/279) of al-Khateeb. And al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee also reported this athar with the same isnaad in Tareekh Baghdaad (3/280). And it is also found in as-Sunnah of Abdullaah bin Imaam Ahmad (1/182).<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span> &quot;Kitaab us-Sifaat&quot; of ad-Daraqutnee (tahqeeq Shaykh Alee Naasir al-Faqeehee), no. 64, p 72.</div>
