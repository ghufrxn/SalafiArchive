<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Is Munfarid (person offering Salaah individually) Required To Announce Athaan (Call to Prayer)?</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question 21:</span></strong> Is it permissible for the person offering Salaah (Prayer) alone to pray without Athaan (call to Prayer)?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> Yes, it is permissible for a person offering Salaah alone to pray without the Athaan, but if he is in the desert or on a remote farm and the like, it is prescribed for him to recite the Athaan even if he is going to pray alone, and the Iqaamah (call to start the Prayer) is prescribed at all times, because of the general meaning of the evidence, and because of the saying of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry (the venerable Sahaby) (may Allah be pleased with him) to `Abdullah Al-Ansary,  <em><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;I see that you like sheep and the wilderness. When you are with your sheep in your wilderness, and you recite the Adhan for your prayers, raise your voice, for no jinn or man or anything within the voice range of the Mu'adhin (caller to Prayer) hears the call, but will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;</span></em>  Abu Sa`id said, I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). This Hadith is related by Imam Ahmad and Al-Bukhari.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta'</span></strong><br /><br /><ul><em>Member - `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud<br />Chairman - `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</em></ul><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;BookID=7&amp;PageID=1830&amp;back=true">http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChap ... &amp;back=true</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Wed Jan 11, 2017 10:52 pm</p><hr />
