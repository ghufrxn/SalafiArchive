<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Following the authentic Hadeeth and to leave every statement that opposes it</span></strong><br /><em>Narrations of the Salaf part 2</em><br />Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<br /><br />1.      From Yahya bin Saeed al-Qattaan (d. 198 A.H.) who said:<br />‘Do not look at the Hadeeth, but look at the Isnaad to see if the Isnaad is saheeh, otherwise do not be deceived by the Hadeeth if the Isnaad is not authentic.’<br /><em>[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 9/188]</em><br /> <br />2.      From Umar bin AbdulAzeez (d. around 100 A.H.) that he wrote to some people:<br />‘No one can have an opinion against the Sunnah which was established by the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’<br /><em>[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/781]</em><br /> <br />3.      From Malik ibn Anas (d. 179 A.H.)  who said:<br />‘Every ones statement can be taken or left except for the inmate of this grave -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’<br /><em>[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 8/93]</em><br /><br />4.      From Uthmaan who said:<br />‘A man came to Maalik and asked him about an issue.  So Maalik said to him: ‘The Messenger of -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said such and such’.  The man said to him ‘Do you hold that view?’ Imam Malik said:<br />فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ<br />&lt;&lt; And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e. his Sunnah)(among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&gt;&gt; [Noor: 63]’<br /><em>[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’  6/326]</em><br /> <br />5.      From Maalik ibn  Anas (d. 179 A.H.)  who said:<br />‘The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established Sunnan, following them is following the Book of Allaah, and it is completion of obedience to Allaah, and strength upon the Deen of Allaah.  It is not permissible for anyone to change it, nor to look into that which opposes the Sunnah.  Whosoever seeks guidance by it, then he is guided.’<br /><em>[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 8/98]</em><br /><br />6.      From Yahya bin Yahya at-Tameemi (d. 226 A.H.) who said:<br />‘I heard Abu Yusuf saying: Everything that I have given a verdict about, then indeed I take it back except for that which is in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah.’<br /><em>[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 8/537]</em><br /> <br />7.      From ar-Rabia’ who said: ‘I heard Shaafi’ee saying:<br />‘If you find in my book that which opposes the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, then take the Sunnah and leave that which I said.’<br /><em>[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 10/34]</em><br /> <br />8.      From Maalik ibn  Anas (d. 179 A.H.) who said:<br />‘Indeed I am a human, I can make mistakes, and I can be correct, so look into my opinion, everything that is in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah, then take it, and everything that does not agree with the Book and the Sunnah then leave it.’<br /><em>[From ‘Jamia’ Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/775]</em><br /> <br />9.      From Sufyan who said:<br />‘Learn a lot of Ahadeeth, indeed they are weapons.’<br /><em>[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’  6/362]</em><br /> <br />10.  Abul Hasan Shabwayhi said:<br />‘Whoever wants knowledge about the grave then he should adhere to the Athaar, and whoever wants knowledge of bread then he should adhere to opinions.<br /><em>[From ‘Tadreeb ar-Rawee’  2/565]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/narrations-of-the-salaf-part-2/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... af-part-2/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Mar 01, 2017 11:07 pm</p><hr />
