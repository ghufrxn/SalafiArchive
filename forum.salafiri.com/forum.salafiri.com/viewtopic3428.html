				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">When to say Masha Allah &amp; Barakallah</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen – When to say Masha Allah Tabarak Allah:</em><br /><br />Fatawaa noor ‘ala adarb tape no321<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Questioner:</span></strong><br /><br />May Allah extend your life! This is the questioner, Abu Abdullah, he says in the first question, If a person sees what amazes him, does he say Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah!), or Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah Laa Quwwata illah billah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah, there is no strength except with Allah) and are they all correct?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />All praises are due to Allah, Lord of the worlds and prayer and salutation upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, his companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgement.<br /><br />If a person sees that which amazes (pleases) him, pertaining to his wealth, then he should say Maashaa Allah Laa Quwwata illa billah, just as in the story of the companion of the two gardens, when his companion said to him: It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: That which Allah wills there is no power except with Allah. This is if he sees something amazing (pleasing) with his wealth.<br /><br />If he sees it in other than himself then he should say Barakallahu Alaihi (May Allah bless it for him) or a statement similar to it.<br /><br />And if he sees something that amazes (pleases) him from the matters of the Dunya (world) he should say: Labbaik, Innal Aish, Aishul Aakhirah, as the Prophet ( ) used to say. So he says Labbaik meaning an answer to you then he said verily the (real) life is the life of the hereafter. He makes it firm within himself at the same instance that the Dunya and whatever is within it does not remain and there is not any life in it but verily the real life is the life of the hereafter.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2010/02/11/when-to-say-masha-allah-barakallah/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2010/02/11/w ... arakallah/</a><!-- m --></div>
