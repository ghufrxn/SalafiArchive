What is your advice to them during this critical period in their life?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> Muslim youth should hold fast to the Rope of Allah and adhere to the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and also invite others to the Way of Allah. They should not side with their own view of things, even though the truth is on the other side. Rather, they should follow the truth wherever it may be, for truth is the worthiest to be followed. In general, the youth must take the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as their ideal and mould their life according to the life and example of the Prophet (peace be upon him): his acts, his noble manners, his good repute and his calling to the Way of Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says (what means): <em><span style="color: #0000FF">Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow.</span></em><br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br /><br /><em>Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’</em><br /><br />Member - `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud<br />Member - `Abdullah ibn Ghudayyan<br />Deputy Chairman - `Abdul-Razzaq `Afify<br />Chairman - `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=273&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" class="postlink">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee</a></div>
