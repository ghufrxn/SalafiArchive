<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Ahadeeth Regarding Tawheed</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Chapters of Tawheed and the Shahadtayn</span></strong><br /><br /><em>From the ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ Of Shaykh Al-Albaani</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1- There is no good in the Arabs nor the Non-Arabs except with Islaam</span></strong><br /><br />“Whoever from a household, from among the Arabs and the non-Arabs, whom Allaah intends good for them, Allaah enters Islaam upon them, then the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fitn</span></strong> appear as if it were a shade.”<br /><br /><em>Silsilah Saheehah : 51</em><br /><br /> <br />Hakim (1/61-62) narrated from the narration of Ibn Shihab who said: “Umar bin al-Khattab left for Shaam and Abu Ubaida ibn al-Jarrah was with us, and they came upon a wet ditch, and Umar was upon a she-camel, he got down from her and took off his leather socks and carried them on his shoulder, and took the reins of the she-camel and walked her through the wet ditch.”<br /><br />Abu Ubaida said: “<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">O Ameer –ul-Mumineen</span></strong>, you do this?! Take your leather socks off and carry them on your shoulder, and take the reins of your she-camel and walk her through the wet ditch?! It does not please me that the people of this country see you like this?”<br /><br />Umar said: “Oh! If only someone other than you Abu Ubaida had said this, I would have made an example of him for the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ummah</span></strong> of Muhammad –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam!<br /><br />Indeed, we were the most insignificant of people and Allaah honoured us with Islaam.  No matter how much we seek honour with other than what Allaah has honoured us with, then Allaah will make us the most insignificant of people.”<br /><br />And Hakim said about this hadeeth: “It is <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Saheeh</span></strong> according to the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim.” And ad-Dhaahbi agreed with him, and the hadeeth is like they have said.<br /><br />In another narration he said: “<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">O Ameer –ul-Mumineen</span></strong>, you will meet the soldiers and the generals of Shaam, and this is your condition?”<br /><br />Umar said: “Indeed we are a people, whom Allaah has honoured with Islaam, so we will never seek honour with other than Islaam.”<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/ahadeeth-regarding-tawheed/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... g-tawheed/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 07, 2017 4:18 pm</p><hr />
