<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Disobeying the Rulers &amp; Abandoning the Scholars - Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Aziz Ali-Shaykh</span></strong><br /><br />‘Abdul-‘Aziz Ali-Shaykh[1] on Disobeying the Rulers &amp; Abandoning the Scholars[2]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Some biased and questionable people these days are promoting by way of the internet and calling the youth of this country to disregard obedience to the leaders/government of the country and to instead oppose them. They also call the youth not to listen to the scholars in this regard. So, we ask for your counsel and comments on this.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> We seek refuge with Allah from such evil circumstances. These are the hypocrites. They are astray and in their hearts is a disease. They envy Islam and its people. Whoever calls to opposing and rebelling against the leader, whoever calls to insurgence against the authorities, and whoever calls to chaos, then there’s hypocrisy in his heart and a disease. May Allah suppress and disgrace such a person.<br /><br />This person is, and we seek help from Allah, one of the callers to evil and wickedness and of those who cause distress to a nation. He’s one of those who have a sickness of envy in their hearts towards Islam and its adherents. They love to spread chaos and anarchy among Muslim societies.<br /><br />It is required for every Muslim to have insight and to fully comprehend all that he hears.<br /><br />No doubt, the internet is one of the most technological advances in communication. However, unfortunately it sometimes contains websites and allows access to the promotion of criminal, misleading, and hypocritical information which takes others away from Allah. These are politically sectarian people causing nothing but corruption. Allah (Jalla wa 'Alaa) says:<br /><br />And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on earth,” they say, “We are only trying to rectify and better the situation.” For sure, they are the corruptors but they don’t perceive it. [Surah al-Baqarah, 2:11-12]<br /><br />Anyone who invites another person to oppose and rebel against the obedience of those in leadership and not to listen to them, then assume the worst of such a person in that he’s a hypocrite and a wicked sinner. He has no allegiance, no religion, and no loyalty. This is so because, and we seek refuge with Allah, these types of incitements promote chaos, bloodshed, the plundering of property, and the violation of people’s rights. Our society, thanks to Allah, is a Muslim society under Muslim leadership. There are men in its service working for the well-being of the country, defending it, some working throughout the entire night safeguarding it in order to protect it in every possible way. They sacrifice their time and money for the establishment of this society. Whenever any ways leading to evil arise, Allah repels them from this country by means of what it contains of good, rectifications, legislative rulings, and good intentions from those in positions of authority in the country. May Allah grant them success and guide them to all that’s good.<br /><br />So, these types of calls and invitations on the internet and by other means originate from envious people and misguided hypocrites. They cannot come from a Muslim who fears Allah and remains conscious of Him. A Muslim is someone who fears Allah conscientiously, calls to that which Allah calls to of listening to and obeying the leaders in obedience to Allah, and supports them by cooperation, especially in these recent times of dangers and tribulations that threaten all Muslim societies. So, alliance, cooperation, mutual support, and the unity of hearts and goals, and of the ranks of the people – this is what’s obligated upon us and required from every individual among us. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) said:<br /><br />“Whoever meets Allah (dies) with no allegiance of obedience upon him, then he dies a death in a state of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic state of ignorance).”[3]<br /><br />Whoever has within his heart envy and enmity towards the country and belittles obedience and social order, he lives a wretched life and dies the death of Jahiliyyah. A Muslim should love the good for other Muslims. He should love that they are united and that their hearts and ranks are one. It’s well-known that these enemies desire only chaos and disorder and not unity.<br /><br />This country is envied because of its religion, its safety, its leadership, affluence and rich resources, and its unity and uniformity. So, we ask Allah for His protection from these misguiding propagations. Every Muslim is required, when hearing such evil, to pay no attention to it, reject it, and make it known that it originates from people with hearts full of envy and animosity, of deviance and evil – from those waging war against Allah and his messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam).<br /><br />May Allah protect our Muslim lands from every evil. We ask Allah to preserve for us our religion, our safety, and our leadership. May He unite us on obedience to Him and may He prevent the plots of the treacherous and the hatred of the envious.[4]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abdul-‘Aziz Ali-Shaykh on Disobeying the Rulers &amp; Abandoning the Scholars</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Original Title:</span></strong> الفتاوى الشرعية في القضايا العصرية<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Author:</span></strong> Abdul-‘Aziz Ali-Shaykh<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/">http://www.authentic-translations.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br />[1] ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Ali-Shaykh: The current Grand Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
