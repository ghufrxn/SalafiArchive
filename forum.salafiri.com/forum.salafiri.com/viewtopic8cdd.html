These are beliefs of kufr (disbelief), while notifying about that which the Scholars notified about&#058; that this is a general ruling, and applying this ruling requires returning to the Scholars and their implementation. Applying it requires returning to the Scholars, and they look to the circumstances of the issue and the ruling on each individual according to what the principles of the Sharee’ah necessitate.<br /><br /><em>However, as a general ruling and general differentiation: al-Bid‘ah al-Mufassiqah does not make the person who performs it – by word or deed – leave the Religion. As for al-Bid‘ah al-Mukaffirah, then the ruling on the person who performs it is that he is a disbeliever.</em><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Another notification:</span><br /><br /><em>al-Bid‘ah al-Mufassiqah means – according the Scholars – that the innovators are not Saalihoon (pious, righteous people), rather they are fasaqah (disobedient, rebellious people) from the wicked fussaaq (disobedient, rebellious people). This is why some people say to you, “So and so is a person of innovation, but he is Saalih(righteous) and Taqiy (Godfearing).” We say to you, “You are wrong! As long as he is an innovator, he fell into innovation and the Scholars declared him an innovator, then he is faasiq (disobedient, rebellious).” Na‘am.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2013/10/12/what-is-the-difference-between-al-bidah-al-mufassiqah-bidah-of-faasiq-and-al-bidah-al-mukaffirah-bidah-of-kufr-shaykh-ahmad-baazmool/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2013/10/12/w ... -baazmool/</a><!-- m --></div>
