				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Wasting Water During Wudoo</span></strong><br /><em>Explained by Shaykh Salih Fawzan</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> O noble Shaykh the questioner asks concerning the narration: ‘Do not be wasteful, even if you are at the bank of a flowing river.’ Is this a hadith? And what is the ruling concerning being wasteful with water during Wudoo?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Fawzan:</span></strong> Yes, wasting water is not permissible during Wudoo and for other than Wudoo, but during Wudoo it is more severe because Wudoo is worship and it is not permissible to exaggerate in worship; rather it can only be performed in the legislated manner.<br /><br />The origin of this hadith is the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saw S’ad ibn Abi Waqas pouring a lot of water, thus he صلى الله عليه وسلم prohibited him from that during the Wudoo. Sa’d رضي الله عنه said: “O messenger of Allah, is there extravagance in water?” He replied: “Yes, even if you are at the bank of a flowing river.”<br /><br />In summary, wastefulness is not permissible. Allah the Exalted said:<br /><br /><ul>وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا وَلََ تُسْرِفُوا إِنَّه لََ يُحِ ب الْمُسْرِفِينَ</ul><br />Eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not those who waste by extravagance. (Soorah Al-'A`raf 7: 31)<br /><br />And if the extravagance is in worship then it is more severe, because this is adding something to the worship.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mtws.posthaven.com/">https://mtws.posthaven.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
