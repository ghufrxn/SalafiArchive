And How To Make Up What One Misses: Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez ibn Baaz</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />Within the funeral prayer does the worshipper look to the place of prostration as he would in the other prayers or is that not obligatory? And what does one do if he has missed more than one Takbeer in the funeral prayer?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />The Sunnah for the worshipper, within the funeral prayer and other than the funeral prayer, is to look at the place of prostration so that distraction or negligence regarding the prayer does not occur and he has Khushoo’. This is that which is better.<br /><br />If he catches some of the prayer then that which he catches is the beginning of his prayer—this is better—and that which he makes up is the end of his prayer. So if he catches the third Takbeer then he says the Takbeer and recites Al-Faatihah, and when the Imaam says the fourth Takbeer, then he says the Takbeer and sends prayers upon the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). When the Imaam says the Tasleem then he makes the Takbeer and says: ‘O Allaah, forgive him and have mercy on him,’ then he says the Takbeer and says the Tasleem.<br /><br />Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/14073">http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/14073</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/where-does-one-look-in-the-funeral-prayer-since-there-is-no-prostration-and-how-to-make-up-what-one-misses">http://mtws.posthaven.com/where-does-on ... one-misses</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Watch Video @ <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yA">http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yA</a><!-- m --></div>
