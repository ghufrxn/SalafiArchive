<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question:</span></strong> Noble Shaikh, what is the ruling on one who recites the Qur’aan whilst not having wudoo, regardless of whether he recites from memory or from the mus-haf?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Answer:</span></strong> It is permissible for a person to recite the Qur’aan without having wudoo if he recites from his memory. This is since nothing prevented the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from reciting the Qur’aan <span style="color: #0000FF">except for Janaabah (sexual impurity)</span>. He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would recite the Qur’aan whilst in a state of wudoo and without it.<br /><br />As for the mus-haf, it is not permissible for someone who has broken his wudoo to touch it, regardless of whether it is the minor form of impurity or the major form. Allaah says: <strong><em>“No one touches it except for the pure.” [Surah Al-Waaqi’ah: 79]</em></strong> This means: “Those who are pure and free from impurities, uncleanness and Shirk.” Also in the hadeeth, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) wrote a letter to his vice-regent ‘Amr bin Hazm in which he instructed him: <strong><em>“No one should touch the mus-haf except for the purified.”</em></strong><br /><br />This is also the view that has been unanimously agreed upon by the four Imaams – that it is not permissible for one in the state of impurity – whether major or minor state – to touch the mus-haf except from behind a covering, such as when the mus-haf is in a box or a bag or if one touches it using one’s garment or sleeve as a barrier.<br /><br />Source: Questions &amp; Answers on the Qur’aan – Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzaan, al-ibaanah.com<br /><br />​​http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/02/04/reciting-the-quraan-from-memory-or-from-the-mus-haf-whilst-not-having-wudoo-shaykh-fawzaan/<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Dec 05, 2016 10:26 pm</p><hr />
