<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">No one is safe from the Salafis criticism!</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>A doubt refuted by Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee reads the question:</span></strong> O noble Shaykh, we love you for the sake of Allah, and then all the people of knowledge those who defend the Sunnah and its people—(we say may Allah the One whose sake you love us for love you, and make us and you for those who love each other for the sake of Allah)—but  O Shaykh there is a doubt that some of the people bring, they say: You have not left alone anyone except that you have spoken against them. We want clarity; may Allah reward you with good?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee answers:</span></strong> I say: This speech is from that which the people say, and the intent from it is to turn the people away from Ahlus Sunnah, and the intent is to make the people flee from Ahlus Sunnah such that they can alter the atmosphere to the likes of this person who says this, and thus mislead the people. We say this is not correct. For verily Allah—the Exalted—has taken a covenant with people of knowledge that they clarify the truth. And clarifying the truth to the creation is obligatory upon the person who knows it, because it is from advice and sincerity. And falsehood is only established by people, just as the truth is only established by people. Thus warning from falsehood must be accompanied by warning against the people of falsehood.<br /><br />The Prophet, prayers and peace are upon him, described a people with descriptions and he warned against them before they came; may prayers and peace be upon him. And this was advice and sincerity to his Ummah; peace be upon him. So he warned against the Khawarij by mentioning their descriptions. And he warned against those who would come after him from the callers to the gates of the hell-fire, by mentioning that they will be from our skin, speaking our language. Therefore he warned against them; prayers and peace are upon him. And he warned us from those who follow the doubtful matters. Thus he explained the statement of the Blessed and Exalted:<br /><br /><em>It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them].</em> (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:7)<br /><br />This is their condition. Thus he said to Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her:<br /><br /><em>“O Aisha if you see those who follow the unspecific verses, then they are those whom Allah has mentioned so beware of them.”</em><br /><br />Thus Allah—the Exalted—informed us about those who have a deviation in their hearts, this is their description, they follow the unspecific verses seeking discord and seeking an interpretation suitable to them. As for the believer, then no; rather he returns the unspecific verses back to the clear verses because the foundation is the clear verses. As the Exalted said:<br /><br /><em>It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific.</em><br /><br />Thus it is obligatory to return the subsidiary matters back to the foundation, the mother of the Book and these are the clear verses. But the one with a disease in his heart, he is the one who follows the unspecific verses. Therefore the Prophet, prayers and peace are upon him, said: “Beware of them”. And there are numerous narrations similar to this narrated from him, prayers and peace be upon him. And he said concerning a man: “There shall come from his loins…” and other narrations as well. He said about the Qadariyah what he said about them. He said:<br /><br /><em>“The Qadariyah are the Majus of this Ummah, if they become sick then do not visit them and if they die do not witness their funerals.”</em><br /><br />Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: “If you meet them then inform them that verily I am free from them and verily they are free from me”. And the other narrations narrated from him; prayers and peace are upon him, and narrated from the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. And the intent from that is advice and sincerity to the creation; having mercy for them and compassion for them so they will not go astray. Thus whoever speaks with falsehood and calls to falsehood then his affair must be clarified, and his condition must be explained to the people so they will not go astray.<br /><br />As for their statement: “You have not left anyone (except that you have spoken against them)” then this speech is from exaggeration and scare tactics. And all praises belong to Allah. Look at the number of those who have been spoken against.  Count them; are you able to count them or not? You are able to count them. Therefore this statement is incorrect. This statement is false, this statement is false. And we know who they intend by this, they intend those who were (upon the straight path) and they regressed. And Allah the Glorified and Exalted makes firm whomever He will, by His mercy and His virtue. And He leads astray and deviates whom He wills by His wisdom and justice. Thus we ask Allah the Glorified and Exalted for firmness upon the truth and guidance until we meet Him.<br /><br />Umar may Allah be pleased with him, said: The truth has refused to leave me a friend. This is because if you enjoin the good upon the people and forbid them from the evil some of them will accept it and some of them will not. Thus the one who accepts it then he is in agreement and the one who does not accept it then you have performed the right of Allah. And subsequently it is a must that something falls into his heart if Allah did not bestow upon him from His mercy, so he will turn away.  At this point he will begin to make excuses for himself and he will say, “No one is safe from his criticism”. And will Allah aid is sought. Allah has described the believers with His statement:<br /><br /><em>The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those – Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.</em> (Soorah At Tawbah 9:71)<br /><br />This is the condition of the believing men and this is the condition of the believing women, they enjoin the good and they forbid the evil, teaching the truth and directing the creation and forbidding the evil and establishing the good. This is what comprises the life, all of it; teaching the truth and directing the creation and enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. These are the aspects of life. But as for the one who does not want to hear, this is incorrect this is false; this will do nothing for him against Allah.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mtws.posthaven.com/no-one-is-safe-from-the-salafis-criticism">https://mtws.posthaven.com/no-one-is-sa ... -criticism</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jan 09, 2017 12:26 am</p><hr />
