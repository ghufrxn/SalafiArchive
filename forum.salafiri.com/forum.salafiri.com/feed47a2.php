<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Blame Ourselves or Blame the Rulers</span></strong><br />Imaam Ibnul Qayyim / Dr Saleh as Saleh<br /><br />Listen / Download Mp3 Here (Time 10:04)<br />[audio <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/blame-on-us-or-blame-on-rulers-imaam-ibnul-qayyim-saleh-as-saleh.mp3">https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com ... -saleh.mp3</a><!-- m -->]<br /><br />Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) talked about what people think is the fitnah of “our times”, i.e. meaning his own times, but this applies just as well to the contemporary fitnah of our own times. About the ways of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) in this creation vis-a-vis the rulers and the ruled, he said :<br /><br />“And contemplate Allaah’s (Azza wa Jal) Wisdom when He made people of authority, making them a reflection of the ruled. It is as if the deeds of the ruled appear in the form and deeds of their rulers :<br /><br /><ul>    if the ruled are upright, then their rulers will be upright<br /><br />    if the ruled incline away from uprightness, then their rulers will do the same to them<br /><br />    if the ruled transgress and oppress, then their rulers will do the same to them<br /><br />    if there appears deception and plotting from the ruled, then it will be the same from their rulers<br /><br />    if the ruled take away the rights of the people and become miser as to the rights of others, then their rulers will do the same to them and deprive them of their rights<br /><br />    if the ruled take away from the oppressed /weak among them that which they deserve not to take in their transactions with them, then their rulers will do that towards the ruled’s wealth and take what they deserve not, and impose on the ruled taxes and assignments<br /><br />    and whenever the ruled take from the oppressed and weak unjustly, then their rulers will do the same to them and take it by force<br /><br />    so the actions of the ruled appear in the actions of the rulers and it is not in the Divine Wisdom that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) assigns authority over the wicked and evils ones, EXCEPT to the ones who are of their own kind<br /><br />    Since the first generation was of the best generation and of the most righteous, … so were their leaders righteous<br /><br />    It is not befitting Allaah’s Wisdom that in “our times” (Ibnul Qayyim’s times) that those assigned to authority over us be the like of Muawwiya and ‘Umar bin ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, not to mention Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. The leaders of those before us were in accordance with their own conditions and ranks. Our leaders are in accordance with our own condition and rank. In both cases, this is entailed by the Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal).”</ul><br />Such is the conclusion of Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullah) concerning his times, i.e. the 8th century A.H., so what do you think about our own times?<br /><br />The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) pertains to His Attributes. He puts things in accordance with His Hikmah and puts them in their proper places with what fits. The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has a noble and most perfect objective.<br /><br />As for those who hasten in making these roads for “deliverance” and see getting rid of the rulers as the solution to their problems, they confuse symptoms and disease.<br /><br />The rulers are seen as being the causes when in reality they are only the symptoms. The true illness is within the ruled. Therefore, all endeavors towards finding a solution should focus on the ruled themselves.<br /><br />The deeds of the ruled are reflected in the deeds of the people having authority over them. When the people are not ready and are away from the deen of Allaah, who would you expect them to deserve as rulers?<br /><br />Contemplate this very carefully!<br /><br />Dr Saleh As-Saleh(rahimahullaah)<br /><br />Posted from : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://understand-islam.net/site/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=110">http://understand-islam.net/site/index. ...
