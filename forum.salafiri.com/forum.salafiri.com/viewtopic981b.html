				<h3>Holding onto the Sunnah - Shaikh Muhammad Ra'is Nadwi [1430H]</h3>

				<div class="content">Shaikh Muḥammad Raʾīs Nadwi [1430H] said<br /><br /><em>“We find from this Prophetic ḥadīth that every statement, action and method that has become customary amongst the Muslims are futile and rejected in opposition to the texts. Furthermore, all the companions in general abandoned taqlīd and the leader of the Barailwī sect, Aḥmad Yār Khān Nuʿaimī has also acknowledged this.(Jāʾ al-Ḥaq, printed in Jāmnūr Delhī, 1361H [1:27] <br /><br />Thus the ardent muqallids oppose the way of the Messenger of Allāh (sallalahu allay wasallam) and the way of the companions. This Prophetic Ḥadīth mentions the solution to protect oneself from the sheer differences that are to arise amongst the Ummah. Thus it is obligatory to hold onto the Prophetic Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khulāfa and to abstain from inventing new affairs without rendering them to be a part of the Dīn as they are innovations and misguidance…” [Shaikh Muḥammad Raʾīs Nadwi, Ḍhamīr Ka Buḥrān [p.238]</em><br /><br />taken from, Every Innovation is Misguidance of Shaikh Mahmud Ahmad Mirpuri.</div>
