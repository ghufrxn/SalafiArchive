A group of Muslims came to al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) seeking a verdict to rebel against al-Hajjaaj. So they said, &quot;O Aboo Sa'eed! What do you say about fighting this oppressor who has unlawfully spilt blood and unlawfully taken wealth and did this and that?&quot; So al-Hasan said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;I hold that he should not be fought. If this is the punishment from Allah, then you will not be able to remove it with your swords. If this is a trial from Allaah, then be patient until Allaah's judgment comes, and He is the best of judges.&quot;</span></strong> So they left al-Hasan, disagreed with him and rebelled against al-Hajjaaj - so al-Hajjaaj killed them all.<br /><br />About them al-Hasan used to say,<strong><span style="color: #0000FF"> &quot;If the people had patience, when they were being tested by their unjust ruler, it will not be long before Allaah will give them a way out. However, they always rush for their swords, so they are left to their swords. By Allaah! Not even for a single day did they bring about any good.&quot;</span></strong> <br /><br /><em>- Ibn Sa'ad in Tabaqaatul-Kubraa (7/163-165)</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Thu Mar 23, 2017 2:48 pm</p><hr />
