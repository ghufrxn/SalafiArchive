Knowledge</span></strong><br /><br />When one knows that Allah is the only One Who deserves to be worshipped and that to worship other than Him is falsehood, and when he adheres to the implications of that knowledge, he truly knows its meanings. Allah Almighty says:<br /><br />“So know that Laa ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).” [Surah Muhammad (47):19]<br /><br />“Except those who bear witness to the truth, and they know.” [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43):86]<br /><br />The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“When one dies, knowing that indeed none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, he enters Paradise.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">2. Certainty</span></strong><br /><br />One must not only say this phrase, but he must also believe with certainty and conviction in his heart that what he is saying is true: That Allah truly deserves to be worshipped and that all others taken as gods are false:<br /><br />“And those who believe in that which has been sent down (revealed) to you, and in what was sent down before you, and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2):4]<br /><br />Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with Him, related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that indeed I am the Messenger of Allah. No slave meets Allah with this, having no doubt thereof, except that he enters Paradise” (Recorded by Muslim)<br /><br />In another Hadith, Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“Whoever you meet behind this wall who testifies that indeed none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, with his heart believing in it with certainty, then give him glad tidings of Paradise.” (Recorded by Muslim)<br /><br />Allah Almighty described the believers:<br />“Only those are the believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not” [Al-Hujurat (49):15]<br /><br />Meaning, they have a complete level of certainty and conviction. Those who have doubts are the hypocrites:<br /><br />“It is only those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave (to be exempted from Jihad). So in their doubts they waver.” [Surah At-Tawbah (9):45]<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">3. Sincerity</span></strong><br /><br />Sincerity that negates Shirk: One must perform all deeds and actions, sincerely and purely for Allah, seeking His pleasure. That intention must not be corrupted or polluted in the least:<br /><br />“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah and worship none but Him Alone.” [Surah Al-Bayinah (98:5]<br /><br />Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with Him, related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“The happiest of people with my intercession is he who says, ‘None has the right to be worshipped but Allah’, sincerely from his heart.” (Recorded by Al-Bukhari)<br /><br />‘Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“Verily, Allah has made forbidden the Fire from the one who says, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allah’, seeking from that Allah’s Face.”<br />(Recorded by Bukhari)<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">4. Truth</span></strong><br /><br />Truth which negates denial: One must be truthful with Allah in his faith, truthful in his belief, truthful in his sayings, and truthful in the way he carries the message of Islam. Allah Almighty says:<br /><br />“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).” [Surah At-Tawbah (9):119]<br /><br />Mu’adh bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:<br />“There is none that truthfully from his heart bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, except that Allah will forbid upon him the Hellfire.” (Recorded by Al-Bukhari)<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">5. Love</span></strong><br /><br />Love which negates hate: One must love this phrase, its implications, and its adherent who act according to its meanings. Also, one must love Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), giving preference to loving them over all objects of love:<br /><br />“And of mankind are some who take others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love Allah more.”[Surah Al-Baqarah (2) : 165]<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">6. Submission</span></strong><br /><br />Submission which negates Shirk: One must submit himself to all that this magnificent phrase requires of him – Allah Almighty says:<br /><br />“And turn in repentance to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam).” [Surah Az-Zumar (39):54]<br /><br />Submission means compliance to Allah’s Command. Allah Almighty says:<br /><br />“And whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah, while he is a muhsin (good-doer) then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold.” [Surah Luqman (31):22]<br /><br />And Allah said:<br />“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allah and he is a Muhsin (a good doer)”. [Surah An-Nisa (4):125]<br /><br />And:<br />“But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [Surah An-Nisa (4):65]<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">7. Acceptance</span></strong><br /><br />Acceptance which negates rejection: One must accept all of the implications of this phrase, both with his heart and tongue, for Allah Almighty says:<br />Say, “We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us…” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2):136]<br /><br />As for those who say it without accepting it, they are those about whom Allah Almighty says:<br />Truly, when it was said to them: “Laa ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah),” they puffed themselves up with pride. And (they) said: “Are we going to abandon our Alihah (gods) for the sake of a mad poet?”[Surah As-Saffat (37):35-36]<br /><br /><em>[Taken from the book, Explanation of Important lessons (for every Muslim), Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Abdullaah bin Baz, DarusSalam]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://islamtees.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/the-conditions-of-laa-ilaha-illallah/">https://islamtees.wordpress.com/2011/06 ... -illallah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Dec 07, 2016 10:45 pm</p><hr />
