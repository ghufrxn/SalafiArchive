/>After translating the book ‘The (Aqidah of the) Bareilwis and Deobandis Are The Same’ of Shaikh Talib ur Rehman, we thought it would be beneficial to publish it as two separate treatises, with the aim to highlight the beliefs of these two sects separately for the new reader who may want to know the basics of their beliefs.<br /><br />This is an E-Book publication, it can downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.<br /><br />Sha’ban 1436H / June 2015ce<br /><br />Salafi Research Institute 2015<br /><br />[1]<br /><br />The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “lift the veils and show us your might, as the Noor of Allaah is veiled” (Hadaaiq Bakhshish 1/80)<br />Muhammad Yaar Gharhee wrote, “The one who used blow the flute all the time and say I am the slave, will come out on Gods throne and say ana inallaah (for I am Allaah) (Deewaan Muhammadi pg.149)<br /><br />Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed wrote, “Ahmad (a name of the Messenger of ­Allaah) (r) to Ahad (ie the one Allaah) there is no difference as there is no ­attribute of oneness.” (Kaafee no.99 pg.90)<br /><br /> <br />[2]<br /><br />The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.<br /><br />The Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “The enlightened one and the leader of the Helpers (ie Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee) is the complete inheritor, representative and a reflection of the essence of the Messenger of Allaah (r) in terms of all of his ­attributes, his grandeur, his might and his virtues, in the same ­manner Allaah is with all of his attributes and might that he reflected himself in ­Muhammad (r)” (Fatwaa Ifreeqiyyah pg.101)<br /><br />[3]<br /><br />Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan named himself as Abdul Mustafa (ie the worshipping slave of the Messenger Of Allaah (r) (Man Huwa Ahmad Raza pg.16 of Shujaat ­Qadiree)<br /><br /> <br />[4]<br /><br />Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Seeking help and assistance from the prophets, Auliyaa and righteous scholars is permissible even after their deaths as the Auliyaa even after their deaths, have power and rights to help in this world.” (Risaalah Hayaatal-Mawaat of Ahmad Raza Khan, from Fataawa Ridhwiyyah 4/300)<br />Another Bareilwee scholar said, “The power and rights to help of the Auliyaa increase after their deaths” (Fataawa Naeemiyyah pg.249)<br /><br /> <br />[5]<br /><br />Only Allaah Can Help With Calamities And He Alone Is The One Who Is Asked For Help.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ayoob Ridhwi writes about Ahmad Raza Khan,<br /><br />“The remover of the  problems of the creation Ahmad Raza,<br /><br />He is my helper of calamities Ahmad Raza<br /><br />Who gives to me and who gave what<br /><br />Whatever was given you gave Ahmad Raza<br /><br />in both abodes it is your protection<br /><br />Yes help us leader Ahmad Raza<br /><br />When there is the longing on the day of reckoning<br /><br />Hide us in your protection Ahmad Raza<br /><br />When the tongues dry out from thirst<br /><br />Gives us water from the pool of al-Kauthar Ahmad Raza<br /><br />Help us in the grave, when we are called and on hashr<br /><br />Be the one who removes my calamities Ahmad Raza<br /><br />you are the Giver and I am the asker of you<br /><br />I am yours and you are mine Ahmad Raza<br /><br />(Noor Muhammad A’zmaa pg.47-48)<br /><br /> <br />[6]<br /><br />Only Allaah Alone can Remove Calamities<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “There are certain people of Allaah whom he has singled out for the removal of calamities and the people whilst being worried and fearful go to them for help for the removal of their calamities.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.29)<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan further writes, “And the respected (Messenger of Allaah (r) is there for help at difficult times and he is the one who gives the best help so call upon him humbily and he is the one to seek refuge in from every evil.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.10)<br /><br /> <br />[7]<br /><br />Only Allaah Is the One Who We Plea To And He Is The Helper (ie Gauth)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Deedar Alee Bareilwee writes, “There is a Gauth (helper) in every era and without him the Heavens and Earths cannot exist” (Rasool al-Kalaam pg.129)<br />In one place Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Because the Auliya are so wide spread, the system of the world is intact.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.34)<br /><br /> <br />[8]<br /><br />Believing Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge Of The Unseen<br /><br />Bareilweee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Once Shaikh Muhiy ud deen Ibn A’rabee went to an invitation and he saw a young boy who was eating and all of a sudden he starting crying and when he was asked why he was crying he said, “My mother has been ordained to go to Hell and the Angels are taking her right now.” Shaikh Muhiy ud deen had already recited the kalimah 70,000 times and so he transferred the reward of the deed to the boys mother. All of a sudden the boy started laughing so Shaikh Muhiy ud deen asked him why he was laughing and he replied, “I saw the Angels taking my mother to Paradise.” (Malfoozaat Ahmad Raza Khan pg.82, see also Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pg.48)<br /><br /> <br />[9]<br /><br />The People of This World Call Upon Those Who Are Dead, Who Do Not Have The Ability to Speak, Listen, Smell, Hold or To See in This World.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khaan writes, “Once hadhrat Sayyidee Ismaa’eel Hadhramee walked through a graveyard and Imaam Muhib ud deen Tabaree was with him. Hadhrat Sayyidee Ismaa’eel said, “Do you believe you can speak to the dead.” He replied, “yes” (Malfoozaat pgs.200-201 of Ahmad Raza, Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pgs.57-58)<br /><br /> <br />[10]<br /><br />The Coming and Goings of Souls Is A Mere Fallacy of These Mullahs And A Means of Filling Their Hell Bent Stomachs In Which The Deobandee are Similar to the Bareilwees<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />According to the Bareilwees the souls of the believers return to their houses on Thursday’s and whilst remaining near the doors call in a sorrowful voice, “Oh my household , oh my children, oh my close ones, have mercy upon us with sadaqah. Hence the soul of the deceased comes to the house on Friday night and sees whether sadaqah has been given on their behalf or not.” (Risaalah Ityaan al-Arwah in Majmoo’a Rasaa’il 2/69)<br /><br />[11]<br /><br />The Elder Holy Saints Control this World<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar writes, “2 auliya used to live on opposite sides of a river. One day one of them made rice pudding and told his servant to give it to his friend, the servant said “There is a river in the way, how will I get across as I don’t have a boat?” The auliya replied, “Go to the river and say, “I have been sent on the order of the one who has never slept with his wife.” The servant was shocked and thought how is that possible, as the auliya had children. None the less I went, as fulfilling the order was necessary. So I said to the river what I was told to say and all of a sudden the river gave me way.” When he reached the other side he gave the rice pudding to the auliya, who ate it and said, “Convey my greetings to your master.” So the servant said, “i’ll only be able to do that once I get across the river.” The auliya replied, “Go and say to the river, “I have been sent on the order by him who has never eaten in 30 years.” The servant was extremely shocked as the auliya had just eaten in front of him. Yet again with regards to respecting him he remained quiet and ventured to the river said what he was told and the river once again gave him way.” (Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pg.53)<br /><br />[12]<br /><br />Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge of The Unseen<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza writes, “The Messenger of Allaah (r) had knowledge of the 5 keys but he was ordered to conceal this from the people.” (Khaalis Ei’tiqaad pg.56)<br /><br />[13]<br /><br />The Scholars Know the Time of Death of The People And Knowledge of This Earth.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “One day Shaikh Makaarim said, “In the near future 3 people will come here and they will die. He said such and such will die like this and such and such will die like this. After a short while the 3 individuals came and as it happened they died in the same manner that was foretold.” (ad-Daulatul-Makiyyah pg.164)<br /><br />[14]<br /><br />The Scholars Of The Bareilwees and Deobandees Know What Is In The Wombs<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khaan writes, “We have seen groups of people who have found out how we will die. They have also managed to find out what is in a pregnant mothers womb, whether it is a girl or a boy. So now tell us, have we not found out the meaning of this verse or is there still some ambiguity.” (Khaalis Ei’tiqaad pg.53, al-Kalimatul-A’liyah pg.35 of Muradabadee)<br /><br />Another Bareilwee scholar writes, “I have heard from some auliya they can inform people of what is in the wombs whether it is a boy or a girl. I have seen with my own eyes that whatever they predicted, is what happened.” (Kalimatul-A’liyah pg.94-95)<br /><br />[15]<br /><br />Do You Really Get Blessings From Dead People And Those In The Graves.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar by the name of Uthmaan writes, “You can receive blessings by visiting graves and you can also receive help from pious dead people.” (Kashf Fuyoodh)<br /><br />He writes further in another place, “By visiting graves the intent is to receive blessings from the people who are in the graves.” (Kashf Fuyoodh pg.43)<br /><br />[16]<br /><br />The Prophet (r) Lived a Worldly Life In His Grave<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “The living of the Prophets (in their graves) is real, sensuous and like a worldly living.” (Malfoozaat 3/276)<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “The Prophets, eat, drink and pray in their graves.” (Malfoozaat 3/276)<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar, Deedaar Alee wrote. “For 3 consecutive days the Adhaan for the 5 prayers could be heard from the Prophets (r) grave.” (Hidaayatut-Tareeq Fee Bayaan ut-Tahqeeq pg.86)<br /><br />The author of Hayaat un-Nabee wrote, “When the Funeral of Abu Bakr  (t)  was placed near the grave of the Prophet (r) a sound was heard, “Bring or enter the friend to his friend.” (Hayaat un-Nabee pg.125)<br /><br />[17]<br /><br />There is no Harm in Reciting a Different Kalimah to our Kalimah, Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhammadur Rasoolullah.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Shaah Gul Hasan Qaadiree writes, “One day Ghauth Alee Shaah Qalandar Qaadiree said, “Two people came to Abu Bakr Shiblee wanting to give him the pledge of allegiance.[1] So he said to one of them “say, Laa ilaaha Illalaahu Shiblee Rasoolullaah. The man replied, “(La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah, (There is no power or strength except with Allaah). So Shiblee said the same back. The man asked, “Why did you say La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah.” Shiblee asked you tell me first why did you say La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah. The man said because I came to give my pledge of allegiance to someone who is negligent of the Sharee’ah. Shiblee replied well I said it because I revealed my secret to an ignorant person like you.” The second man was told to recite Laa ilaaha Illalaahu Shiblee Rasoolullaah he replied I thought you were something else ie good and pious but your even worse and attacking the prophecy. Shiblee laughed and replied, “I was trying to educate you as everyone’s understanding and morale is different whereas in reality my point is the same as yours so in your heart there was rejection and it never entered your heart and in my heart the morale was even more higher. Shiblee did not mean what was apparent. The point was that the person who educates and guides others then for the student he is the Messenger and the one who fulfils the work of prophecy ordained by Allaah.” (Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah pg.323, Printed by Fareed Book Stall Lahore.)<br /><br />The author of Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah writes, “Muhkam ud deen was a complete worshipper and so once we went to his house and he had very good manners. So we asked his name and he replied Allaah. We said, Subhanallah we have been looking for you in the heavens when in reality you are here. He then asked us our name but we replied, “How can you be Allaah when you don’t even know our names?” He paused for a minute and pondered and then said, “You are Gauth Alee and your father is Ahmad Hasan and your grandfather is Zahoor al-Hasan. Then we said to him now we know you are Allaah. Then a man came to give him his pledge of allegiance and he was told to say Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhkam ud deen Rasoolullaah. We then said to him “You must stop and just be Allaah as you cannot pull off being the one from Madeenah and many people before you claimed to be Gods (ie Allaah) like fir’aun, namrood, shadaad and others.” Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed said, “Once a man came to Khawaja Muhiy ud deen Chistee and said to him, “I want to be your disciple, he replied say, “Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Chistee Rasoolullaah…” (Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah pg.110 Fawaa’id Fareediyyah pg.83, printed by Maktabah Ma’een al-Adaab from Dhera Ghazee Khaan)<br /><br />[18]<br /><br />The Prophet Was Created From Noor<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan mentions a self formulated narration, “The Messenger of Allaah (r) said to Jaabir (t), Without doubt and with certainty Allaah created the noor of your Prophet from his own noor before he created any of the creation. Then that noor remained in oblivion and at that time, the Lauh (the tablet) the Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Jinn and mankind were not created. When Allaah wished to create the creation he divided that noor into 4 parts. He created the Pen with the first, the Lauh with the second, the Arsh with the third and divided the 4th part into further 4 parts.” (Risaalah Salah as-Safaa pg.23)<br /><br />A bareilwee scholar Ahmad Yaar wrote, “The Messenger (r) was created from the Noor of Allaah and all of the creation was created with the Messengers Noor.” (Muwaa’iz Na’aeemiyyah pg.14)<br /><br />[19]<br /><br />Shirk in the Characteristics Of the Prophet (r)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “Headache and fever are those gifted illnesses that the Prophets used to suffer with. (he further goes onto say) Alhamdulillah I also suffer from regular headaches.” (Malfoozaat 1/64)<br /><br />[20]<br /><br />Who is Infallible<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Abdul Hakeem Qaadiree writes, “A’la hazrats (ie Ahmad Raza Khan) pen and tongue were preserved from mistakes and although scholars sometimes do make some mistake however A’la hazrat did not even make a mistake of a single dot.” (Yaad A’la Hazrat of Abdul Hakeem Ashraf Qadiree pg.32, ‘Rememberance Of A’la Haazrat’ (ie Ahmad Raza Khan))<br />Another bareilwee boldly said in Anwaar Raza, “Allaah had purified (ie Ahmad Razas) his pen and tongue from any mistakes.” (Anwaar Raza pg.271)<br /><br />The author further said, “Ahmad Raza was pure from mistakes from his childhood and following the straight path was instilled into him.” (Anwaar Raza pg.223)<br /><br /> <br />[21]<br /><br />Is The Word Of Someone Other Than The Prophets Evidence<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A follower of Ahmad Raza Khan attributed prophethood to him in the following way, “A’la Hazrat (ie Ahmad Raza) was Allaah’s evidence and proof on this earth.”  (Anwaar Raza pg.33)<br /><br /> <br />[22]<br /><br />Who Is The One Who is Really Disrespectful (Gustaakh) To The Prophet<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Bastawee writes, “After the death of Ahmad Raza an Arab man came and said, “On the 25th of Safar in the year 1340H my destiny changed and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (r) in a dream. The Messenger of Allaah (r) has come and his companions are also waiting with him but there is a silence in the gathering and from the indicators I find out that they are waiting for someone. So I said to the Prophet (r), “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, who are you waiting for? He (the Prophet (r) replied, “Ahmad Raza.” I asked, “Who is Ahmad Raza.” The Prophet (r) replied, “A resident of bareilee in India.” After my dream I longed to meet Ahmad Raza so I went to India, Bareilee and found that Ahmad Raza was dead. It was the very same day of the 25th when I travelled and it was also the day of his death.” (Bastawee pg.121, Fataawa Ridhwiyyah vol 2 Muqaddimah pg.13)<br /><br /> <br />[23]<br /><br />Who Disrespects The Companions<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />The one who disrespected the companions by saying the following about Ahmad Raza Khaan, “Seeing A’la hazrat decreased my yearning to see the companions.” (Wasayaa Shareef pg.24)<br /><br />[1] [TN] This Pledge of Allegiance is the pledge a new soofee mureed ie disciple gives to a soofee teacher thereby submitting his will to the teacher. The soofee teacher also commonly known as a Peer, guides and tells the soofee mureed what to do from every aspect of his life from the extent of what to wear, marriage, relations with his wife and so on.<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-barailwis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-t ... ur-rehman/</a><!-- m --></div>
