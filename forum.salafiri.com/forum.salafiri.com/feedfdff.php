In the Name of Allaah, the All-Merciful…<br /><br />The following question was posed to the Permanent Committee of Scholars in Saudi Arabia:<br /><br />    <em>If the iqaamah is called, and a person was praying two rak’ahs of Sunnah prayer or tahiyyat al-masjid, does he stop praying this prayer to join the congregational prayer?  If the answer is yes, then does he give salaams (tasleem) when leaving the prayer or does he simply stop praying without salaams?</em><br /><br />They replied:<br /><br />    <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">What is correct from the two positions held by the scholars is that he stops praying, and there is no need to give salaams when leaving that prayer, he just joins (the prayer behind) the imaam.  And success is only from Allaah.  May He raise the rank of our Prophet Muhammad, and grant him, his family, and companions peace.</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Committee Chairman: Shaykh ‘Abdul-’Azeez ibn ‘Abdillaah ibn Baaz<br />Vice Chairman: Shaykh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ‘Afeefee<br />Member: Shaykh ‘Abdullaah ibn Ghudayyaan<br />Member: Shaykh ‘Abdullaah ibn Qu’ood</em><br /><br />Source: Fataawaa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (no. 7347c, 7/313-314)<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bakkah.net/en/if-someone-stops-his-prayer-because-of-the-iqaamah-does-he-make-tasleem-give-salaams-or-just-stop-praying.htm">http://www.bakkah.net/en/if-someone-sto ... raying.htm</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Nov 18, 2016 10:19 pm</p><hr />
