This Sheikh was a man of goodness and faith. He complained to me of the people’s situation in that country (i.e., Iraq ) under the Tatars (Mongols) rule of ignorance, injustice, and loss of faith and knowledge.<br /><br />He asked me to write him an ‘Aqidah (creed) as a reference to him and his family. But I declined saying: Many creeds have been written. Refer to the scholars of the Sunnah. However, he persisted in his request, saying: I do not want any creed but one you write. So I wrote this one for him while I was sitting one afternoon.<br /><br />Many copies of it are dispersed throughout Egypt, Iraq and other provinces&quot;</ul></em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Taimiyah, VIII, p.164)</span></strong></div>
