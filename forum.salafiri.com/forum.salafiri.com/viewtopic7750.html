				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied as follows:</span></strong><br /><br />What we advise him to do is to <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">begin with al-Baqarah, unless he has memorised from al-Mufassal</span></strong> [the soorahs beginning with Qaaf, until the end of the Quran – al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar], because for some people it is easier to memorise from al-Mufassal because the soorahs and ayaat are shorter, and they hear them a great deal from the imaams in the mosques.<strong><span style="color: #0000FF"> So if that is easier for him, let him begin with that which is easier.</span></strong> We also advise him to <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">pay more attention to what he has already memorised than paying attention to memorising a great deal</span></strong>,because paying attention to what is already there takes precedence over paying attention to what is not there.<br /><br />From: Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 212<br /><br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />It was narrated that Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan said:<br /><br />The companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who used to teach us Quran told us that <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">they would learn ten ayaat, then they would not move on to the next ten ayaat until they had learned the knowledge contained therein and how to act upon it</span></strong>. They said: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">So we learned the knowledge and how to put it into practice</span></strong>.<br /><br />Ahmad, 22384</div>
