				<h3>Is it mandatory to have a tazkiyyah from a scholar to teach?-Shaykh Zayd bin Muhammad bin Hadi al-Madkhali</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong>Question:</strong><br /><br />“You know the state of affairs of the Muslims in the lands of disbelief; that the majority of the youth are non-Arabs, they don't understand Arabic. And so in our city, for example, there is a brother who took upon himself to translate for his brothers the speech of the scholars from their books. Simple books like the explanation of Al-Usool ath-Thalathah by Shaykh Al-’Uthaymeen and some other books.<br /><br />Some people objected to this and it was said to him: “It is mandatory upon you that you have a specific tazkiyyah (recommendation) from a big scholar from Saudi Arabia for example, meaning from a salafi scholar. So what is your speech regarding this?”<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />“My speech regarding this, is that whomsoever learns something from the sciences of the Islamic religion and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and masters it, then there is no sin upon him, rather he will be rewarded if he teaches it (to the people). And it is not a condition that he presents a tazkiyyah.<br /><br />However, one should look at what he teaches the people; if he teaches them what is correct, the rulings of the sharia with its proofs, then this is what is required, and it is not a condition that he has been granted a tazkiyyah from a scholar. And if he makes a mistake; and there has to be someone who criticises the mistake, if he makes mistakes, then it is not allowed for him to teach the people something that is not correct.<br /><br />This is the matter, like the Prophet sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam said:<br /><br /><em>“Convey from me, even if it is just one āyah.” [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, 3202]</em><br /><br />Meaning, this is the proof that whoever carries a small amount of knowledge, while the people are in need of his knowledge, then it is mandatory upon him to convey it (to the people). And it is not allowed for anyone to prevent him from this, except when he sees him misleading the people; that he speaks regarding Allah without knowledge, that he gives fatwa (Islamic verdicts) without knowledge, and that he establishes principles without knowledge, then first and foremost, it is not allowed for him to do so, and it is not allowed to be silent regarding him. However he should be advised to study up until he has gained a portion of knowledge, in order to teach the people. Therefore he is not to be prevented while he is correct. And he is not to be consented to if he makes mistakes.”<br /><br /><strong>Questioner:</strong> “And when he merely translates the speech of the scholars, without adding or removing?”<br /><br />Shaykh: “When he relays the speech of the scholars, while fulfilling the amaanah (trust, responsibility) with regards to knowledge; then there is no sin upon him (the questioner is heard, speech unclear). And this is the way of the students of knowledge, they relay (the speech) from their scholars and from the predecessors; the ones who authored writings and compiled the books of the Sunnah. So he relays from them (their speech), but while fulfilling the amaanah with regards to knowledge. And it is better for him to have a good understanding regarding that which he relays (to the people), so that when he is asked, he is able to clarify the affair, the sharī'ah ruling, the religious matter, as not to fall into mistake. It is therefore a must that, that which is being relayed is also accompanied by a solid understanding of that which the person relays (to the people). Because it is possible that a person relays something which has been twisted, misplaced or which is incorrect, whereby the listeners can be harmed. Thus a good understanding alongside that which is being relayed (from the speech of the scholars) is a must.”<br /><br />Shaykh Zayd bin Muhammad bin Haadee al-Madkhalee, may Allah have mercy upon him<br /><br />Translated by Salafi-Dawah.com.</div>
