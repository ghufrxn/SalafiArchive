				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">How do you know your Lord? The Meaning of the Signs of Allah</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>From the Book “The Path to Attaining Clarification Concerning the Three Fundamental Principles”<br />By The Noble Shaykh Zayd Ibn Muhammad Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</em><br /><br />‘So if it is said to you, ‘How do you know your Lord?’<br /><br />Then say, ‘By His aayaat (signs) and His creation.”<br /><br />So therefore, the aayaat are three categories of aayaat:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">al-Aayaatul-Kawniyyah (universal signs):</span></strong><br />And the meaning of that is this world with its heavens, its earth and whatever is in between them.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">al-Aayaatul-Burhaaniyyah (evidential signs):</span></strong><br />These are the miracles that occurred at the hands of the Messengers and Prophets, such as the miracles that occurred at the hand of Moosaa (’alayhis-salaam) including the clear aayaat.<br /><br />From them is the splitting of the sea, from them is the sticks, from them is the blood, the frogs, lice and locusts which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic informed about in Sooratul-A’raaf; all of them are miracles.<br /><br />And reviving the dead by the permission of Allaah are also miracles, and whatever emanated from our Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) from the numerous miracles, such as the splitting of the moon, the glorification by the pebbles in front of him, the water gushing forth, the submission of the two trees to him, the rock sending salutations upon him and other than that from whatever has been confirmed from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) from the miracles.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">al-Aayaatul-Qur‘aaniyyah (Qur‘aanic signs):</span></strong><br />These are whatever Allaah the Blessed and Exalted sent down upon His Messengers from His speech, from that is the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms, the Furqaan (Qur‘aan) and the scriptures of Ibraaheem and Moosaa and other than that from what Allaah has left from His knowledge.<br /><br />All of this enters into the phrase ‘His aayaat.’ That is, then say, ‘By His universal signs.’ Therefore, observing the universe proves the greatness of this creation. So it is not possible that this universe came into being all of a sudden, nor is it possible that it was produced by something from the created beings, nor it is possible that the creation created itself. All of that is self-delusion. Therefore, the only possibility which remains is that universe which is witnessed and which is from the great aayaat is an evidence for the existence of al-Khaaliq (the Creator) the Glorified and Exalted. And the Creator is Allaah alone. Likewise, all of the created things along with their variations in types and categories are all proof for the existence of the Creator and they are a proof for His capability. After that, they are a proof that He alone is deserving of worship and no one else is deserving of that.”<br /><br />Said Shaykhul-Islaam Muhammad Ibn ’Abdul-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah,<br />“And from His signs are the night, the day, the sun and the moon. And from His creations are the seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is in them and whatever is in between the two of them.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Reason why mankind is neglectful of considering the night and the day:</span></strong><br />Commented al-’Allaamah Zayd Ibn Muhammad Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee – hafidhahullaah,<br /><br />“These are from the most apparent of the creation that we can see at every moment from the moments. Then he mentioned the universal signs. The night comes with its shade, then it clears up. Then the day comes with its light, and the night follows it up. So in these two time periods is a lesson and in them is proof for the capability (qudrah) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic who enters the night into the day and enters the day into the night. However, due to the continued repetition of new days and nights, mankind has become heedless with regards to the lesson contained within them. And mankind has become neglectful regarding the magnificent work of Allaah the Glorified and Exalted in making them easy for man. And from the greatest of worldly benefits and advantages in the night and the day is what the servants are guided to from acts of obedience, obligatory duties obligations and mustahibbaat (preferred deeds) and inclination towards those things that bring one closer to Allaah and remaining far away from that which He has prohibited. This is the meaning that Allaah has pointed out when He said, “He is the One who made the day and the night succeed each other, for those who wish to be reminded or wish to be thankful.” [Sooratul-Furqaan 25:62] Meaning, this succeeds that. And these two will not end until the known day and time (the Final Hour) arrives. This will exchange the earth and the skies and it will become apparent to them all that Allaah is the One, the Irresistible.<br /><br />Read this excellent book for free @ <a href="http://troid.ca/media/pdf/sharhthalaathatulusool.pdf" class="postlink">The Path to Attaining Clarification Concerning the Three Fundamental Principles</a> – <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.troid.ca/">www.troid.ca</a><!-- w --><br /><br /><strong><em>Source:</em></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2010/02/03/how-do-you-know-your-lord-the-meaning-of-the-signs-of-allah/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2010/02/03/h ... -of-allah/</a><!-- m --></div>
