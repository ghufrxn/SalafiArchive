And ash-Shanqiti placed great concern on this subject in 'Adwa al-Bayan. May Allah have mercy upon them all.[/list]</ul><br />I will end with the following conclusions:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Firstly</span></strong>: I have mentioned these books based upon my knowledge and study of them, however with some of these works, I have followed the statements of the people of knowledge regarding them.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Secondly</span></strong>: Mentioning the best book on such a thing is similar to the statements of the muhadithin: “The most correct thing in this subject [is such and such]”. I do not mean by mentioning the best book on such a thing – that everything it contains is correct. Certainly, Allah (Azza wa Jall) has refused perfection except for His (Subhana Wa ta'alaa) Book. And the praise is given for whose good has outweighed its bad.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Thirdly</span></strong>: If any author of the aforementioned books fell into error, then the correct position that we hold towards him is that he is a person of knowledge. We take that which he was accurate in and leave that which he erred in. And we presume that he has two rewards in that which he is correct and one reward for that which he as erred in.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fourthly</span></strong>: Some of the aforementioned books are suitable for both the beginner and advanced student of knowledge, whilst some others are not suitable except for the advanced. If the student of knowledge reads a book and does not understand it, he should search for a shaykh to explain it to him. If he does not find a shaykh, he should look for another book on the subject which is easier for him.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fifthly</span></strong>: There is no problem if one finds a shaykh from Ahlus-Sunnah, who is firmly grounded to teach him any of these books or other titles. Since the basis is of studying is at the hands of the shaykh and not the book.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Lastly</span></strong>, the best of books after the Book of Allah (Subhana Wa ta'alaa) and the books of the Prophetic Sunnah are those based upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah. They do not oppose the Islamic legislation nor aid innovations, and they follow the reliable proof without straying from the path of the Salaf.<br /><br />Any of these books which are related to instrumental knowledge, it is sufficient to familiarize oneself with its fundamentals, and there is no need to delve heavily into them. Such as the knowledge of language, al-‘Usul, expressions, grammar [an-Nahw], terminologies [al-Mustalah] and the like. The intended acquisition is knowledge of the explanation of the Qur’an and the meanings of the noble hadiths, and to implement them, so as to obtain happiness in this life and the next.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 21, 2017 10:24 pm</p><hr />
