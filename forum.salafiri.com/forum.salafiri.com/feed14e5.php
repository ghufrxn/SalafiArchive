<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Ruling Of Performing Salaah In A Masjid That Has A Grave In It]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=929&amp;p=973#p973"><![CDATA[
Question: There is an individual who says: The ruling regarding the Salaah performed in a Masjid that has one grave, differs from a Masjid that has two, three or more graves in it. We request you to clarify this issue for us. Furthermore, what is its ruling when the Prophet of Allah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) has indeed said: “Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians for taking the graves of their prophets as Masjids.”[2]<br /><br />Bearing this in mind, there are some people after visiting the Prophet’s (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) Masjid in Madinah who argue that if the graves of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and his two noble companions (radhi-yAllaahu ‘anhumaa) are located within the Masjid, and that the Prophet’s Masjid (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) is like any another general Masjid in which it is permissible to perform Salaah [with the graves present there] Can you please explain this further?<br /><br />Response: The Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) cursed those people that built Masjids upon graves, and also warned against it as it was narrated in the aforementioned Hadeeth. He (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) also said:<br /><br />    Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as Masjids; I forbid you to do that<br /><br />This narration has been reported by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh.[3] It has also been reported by the two Shaykhs[4], on the authority of Aa‘ishah(radhi-yAllaahu ‘anhaa) : Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah (radhi-yAllaahu ‘anhumaa) mentioned a church they had seen in Ethiopia and in the church there were pictures [in it]. When they told the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) of this, he said:<br /><br />    Those people are such that if a pious man amongst them died, they build a place of worship over his grave and paint these pictures in it. Those people will be Allah’s worst creatures on the Day of Resurrection[5]<br /><br />So the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) pointed out consequently that the worst of all creation according to Allah are those who build Masjids upon graves and he warned against this act of theirs.<br /><br />Hence, this implies and indicates that if a Masjid is located in the place of a grave or many graves, the Salaah must not be performed at such a place and there is no difference whether it has a single grave or more. Also if there is a Masjid that has been built afterwards upon the graves, it is an obligation to demolish that Masjid. The graves must be left in their normal apparent state with no building construction upon them. As this was the condition of all the graves in the time of the Messenger of Allaah ,(sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) at the graveyard of Baqee[6] and others. This is the condition of all the graves in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The graves have been left in their normal apparent state, there is no construction done upon them, there are no domes built upon them, there are no Masjids built upon them, and all praise is due to Allah for this great bounty of His.<br /><br />However, regarding a Masjid that is old, and at the time of its construction there were no graves present within it, and then afterwards a grave or graves were built inside, then that grave or graves must be exhumed and dug up and the deceased moved to the public graveyard where there are no domes, no Masjids, and no constructions upon the graves. Then this old Masjid will once again be free from graves so that the people may be able to perform their Salaah in it.<br /><br />With regards to some ignorant people who stipulate the permissibility of graves being allowed in Masjids due to the presence of the Prophet’s (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) grave and his two noble companions (radhi-yAllaahu ‘anhumaa) graves being part of his (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) Masjid, then this can not be presented as an argument or proof, because the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) and his two noble companions (radhi-yAllaahu ‘anhumaa) were buried in his (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) house and not inside the Masjid. But when Alwaleed bin Abul-Malik bin Marwaan[7] decided to expand the Prophet’s (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) Masjid, he included the house of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) as part of the Masjid, due to his intended extension.<br /><br />Alwaleed bin Abdul-Malik bin Marwaan committed an error when he did this, and what was obligatory upon him was not to include the house of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) as part of the Masjid so that the ignorant people would not be able to use this as evidence, and others that may advance themselves with this argument and present similar doubts. Without a doubt the people of knowledge rejected and refuted Alwaleed bin Abdul-Malik bin Marwaan with regards to this action of his. So therefore it is not permissible to follow Alwaleed bin Abdul-Malik bin Marwaan by building Masjids upon graves.<br /><br />Furthermore, no assumptions should be made by anyone regarding the grave of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) that this action permits construction upon graves or building graves inside Masjids. This is because the house of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) was a separate house separated from the Masjid that was included and made part of the Masjid for the need of expanding it. So the real condition of the Prophet’s (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) grave was just like the graveyard that can be found opposite his Masjid, separate from it, in which there is no harm, and this was the actual state of the Prophet’s (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhe wa sallam) grave separated by a wall and barriers.<br /><br />It should be the aim of every single Muslim to clarify this issue to his brothers [&amp; sisters] so that they do not make this mistake and develop an incorrect understanding on this issue.<br /><br />Reference: Noor ‘alad-Darb Radio Programme, audio tape 62<br /><br />Footnotes<br /><br />1) Abu Bakr: he is Abdullah bin Uthmaan bin A’meer bin Amr bin Ka’ab bin Sa’ad bin Taym bin Murrah bin Ka’ab bin Luwai Attaymee Alqurshi.
