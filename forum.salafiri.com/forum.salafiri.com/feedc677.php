When A Man Leads Two Or More Boys Who Have Not Yet Reached Seven Years Of Age, Where Should He Place Them, Behind Him, Or On His Right Side?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />When a man leads two or more boys who have not yet reached seven years of age, where should he place them, behind him, or on his right side?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>Answer by the Permanent Committee for Research and Verdicts:</strong></span><br /><br />The Sunnah for worshippers who have reached seven years of age or more, is to stand behind the imaam, like adults. However, if there is only one, he should stand on the right of the imaam, because it has been authentically reported from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he prayed in the house of Abu Talhah and he placed Anas and the orphan behind him and Umm Sulaim behind them. And it has also been authentically reported from him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in another narration that he led Anas in prayer and placed him on his right side and that he led Ibn Abbas in prayer and placed him on his right side.<br /><br /><em>Fatawa Islamiyyah Vol. 2 Page 326</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Tue Sep 20, 2016 1:48 am</p><hr />
