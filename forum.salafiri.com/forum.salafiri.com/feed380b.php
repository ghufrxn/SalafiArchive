Imaam as-Saaboonee (d. 449H) said about Ahlus-Sunnah, “They follow the Salafus-Saalih the Imaams and the Scholars of the Muslims, and they cling to the firm deen that they clung to and to the clear truth. And they hate Ahul-Bid’ah (the People of Innovation) who innovate into the Deen that which is not from it. <br /><br />They do not love them and they do not keep company with them. They do not listen to their sayings, nor sit with them, nor argue with them about the Deen, nor debate with them.<br /><br />Rather, they protect their ears from hearing their futility; things, which if they pass through the ears and settle in the hearts, will cause harm and cause doubts and wicked ideas to appear. And concerning this Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent down:<br /><ul><em>“And when you see people engaged in vain discourse about Our Signs, then turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme.”</em> <br />[Soorah al-An’aam (6):68] </ul><br />Risaalah fil-I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah Ashaabil-Hadeeth, p. 100, of Imaam as-Saaboonee.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 3:01 pm</p><hr />
