<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Concealing Pregnancy due to Fearing the Evil Eye</span></strong><br /><em>Answered by Shaykh Salim Bamehriz</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Is it permissible for a woman to not inform her family—her uncle, her cousins or her friends—that she is pregnant, because she fears the evil eye or magic?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Salim Bamehriz:</span></strong> Informing others about these matters was not known among the Salaf (the first and best generation of Muslims). When a woman became pregnant she would not spread her business among the people, and this is not incumbent upon her to begin with. Furthermore; those that know you are pregnant cannot harm you if you are from those who are diligent in saying the remembrance of the evening and the morning. This safeguards the person from a great deal of evil and protects them from many predicaments. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee <br /><br />Source/Audio: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/concealing-pregnancy-due-to-fearing-the-evil-eye">http://mtws.posthaven.com/concealing-pr ... e-evil-eye</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 11:50 am</p><hr />
