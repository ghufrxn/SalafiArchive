<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari Said About The Soofeeyah</span></strong><br /><em>Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1 – Seeking Blessings</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:<br /><br />‘I saw a person who came for Hajj and there were people gathered around him, and they took his turban, it was white, they tore it up, and some of them began eating it.<br /><br />So I said to one of them: ‘Why do you eat from his turban?’<br /><br />A person said: ‘This person is a Haji and we are seeking blessings from his turban.’<br /><br />I wanted to make him understand [that this is wrong] but he refused to accept and also those along with him.’[2]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 – Superstitions</span></strong><br /><br />‘Indeed all types of superstitions are in the Turq (different paths of the Soofeeyah).’[3]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3 – Play</span></strong><br /><br />‘The worship of the Soofeeyah is playing.’[4]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4 -Naqshbandeeyah</span></strong> [5]<br /><br />‘No one authors, distributes and prints books against the Dawa’ as-Salafeeyah[6] in the world like that what the Turks do and the government of the Rawafidah (Shia) in Iran.  Because the increase of ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah was not lessened until the Turks began ruling. They are the Naqshbandeeyah, and the Naqshbandeeyah are the enemies of the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah.’[7]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5 – Relieved from Worship</span></strong><br /><br />‘I saw a man in Africa who was a big Soofi, and people would come to him and kiss his head, his hand, his belly, and his feet and there was a large majority of people around him.<br /><br />When the prayer time came he did not pray, so I asked about this, and his companions said to me: ‘He does not pray because he is relieved of Islaamic duties. I had read about these types of people in books, and now I have seen them.’[8]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">6 – The Soofeeyah are Made Up Of</span></strong><br /><br />‘The Soofeeyah are made up of Judaism, fire-worshippers, polytheism, and a basic foundation of Islaam, but Islaam only by name, and they are the brothers of the colonialists.’<br /><br />AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari adds: ‘He means the extreme Soofeeyah.’[9]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">7 – Dangers of the Soofis</span></strong><br /><br />‘Indeed the Soofi deviants are more dangerous to Islaam than the disbelief of the Russians and Americans.

The Belief of Ibn Arabi<br /><br />Ibn Arabi says the haqiqi or real and actual wujud or existence is of Allah alone and we see numerous entities which can not be denied because everything in reality and in essence is Allah.... his wujud is absolute he has no name no other attribute and nor will he be seen in the hereafter, he has no speech nor does he have any knowledge and there is nothing else that exists other than him and he can be seen in the creation (Tanbiyatul Ghabi pg.40, Imam al-Awsth pg.132 of Ibn Taymiyyah and Qatar al-Wali pg.190)<br /><br />This is a glimpse of Ibn Arabi and his horrendous beliefs. He strips Allah The Mighty and Majestic of his Glorious Attributes just like the Jahmiyyah, Rafidah and Mutazilah Ashairah do.<br /><br />His beliefs are pure Jahmi and mutazili which goes to show and elucidate the Sufiyyah are mostly jahmis in fact almost all of them.<br /><br />Point to remember Sufis claim to be upon a path which creates a closer union with Allah when on the other hand they deny his attributes, one asks the question what kind of god are they trying to unite with.<br />Jahmism at its worst.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 6:46 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Brief Look At Abdul-Qadir Jilani And Moinuddin Chishti, And Their ‘Aqeedah (Doctrine)</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Could you tell me about the historical figures Shaykh Abdul-Qadir al-Jilani and Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti? Because there are many of their followers around the world, hence I want to know how close they were to the path of truth?</span></strong><br /><br />Praise be to Allah.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Firstly: </span></strong><br /><br />1.<br /><br /><em>Abdul-Qadir al-Jilani </em><br /><br />His full name is Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Qaadir ibn Abi Saalih ‘Abdullah ibn Jangi Dost al-Jeeli al-Hanbali. <br /><br />2.<br /><br />Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir was born in Jeelaan (Jilan) in Tabaristan, in 471 AH; he died in 561 AH. <br /><br />3.<br /><br />He learned from Abu Ghaalib al-Baaqillaani, Ahmad ibn al-Muzaffar and Abu’l-Qaasim ibn Bayaan. <br /><br />As-Sam‘aani, al-Haafiz ‘Abd al-Ghani and Shaykh Muwaffaq ad-Deen ibn Qudaamah narrated from him. <br /><br />4.<br /><br />Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said of him: The shaykh, imam, scholar, ascetic (zaahid), ‘aarif (devoted worshipper), Shaykh al-Islam, ‘Alam al-Awliya’ (The most prominent of the close friends (awliya’, sing. wali) of Allah). <br /><br />Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’, 20/439 <br /><br />Imam as-Sam‘aani (may Allah have mercy) said of him: ‘Abdul-Qaadir was one of the people of Jilan, the imam and shaykh  of the Hanbalis of his time, a scholar, righteous, religiously committed, charitable; he remembered Allah a great deal (dhikr), was always deep in thought and was quick to weep. <br /><br />See: Siyar A ‘laam an-Nubala’, 20/441 <br /><br />Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He had a dignified bearing, and he kept quiet except for enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil; he had very little interest in worldly gain (i.e., he was an ascetic); miracles were attributed to him; his followers and companions spoke a great deal about him and narrated from him his words, actions and miracles, but most of the reports about his miracles are exaggerated. He was righteous and pious, and wrote books called al-Ghunyah and Futooh al-Ghayb, in which there are good things and in which he also quoted da‘eef (weak) and mawdoo‘ (fabricated) hadeeths. To sum up, he was one of the leading shaykhs. <br /><br />Al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah, 12/768 <br /><br />5.<br /><br />Some students decided to research the ‘aqeedah (doctrine) and life story of Jilaani, as did Shaykh Sa‘eed ibn Musfir  in his book Shaykh ‘Abdul-Qaadir Jilani wa Araa’uhu al-I‘tiqaadiyyah wa’s-Sufiyyah (Shaykh Abdul-Qadir Jilani and his doctrinal and Sufi beliefs), which was his doctoral thesis in Umm al-Qura University [in Makkah]. Summing up his research, he said: <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Firstly:</span></strong> Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani was Salafi in his ‘aqeedah (beliefs), in accordance with the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah in all matters of ‘aqeedah, such as issues of faith, Tawheed (affirming the Oneness of Allah), Prophethood, and the Last Day. He also affirmed that it is obligatory to obey those in authority, and that it is not permissible to rebel against them. <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Secondly:</span></strong> He was one of the leading Sufi shaykhs during their early stages, when their concepts were moderate and closer to the Sunnah, and in most cases were based on the Qur’an and Sunnah, with a particular focus on deeds of the heart (spirituality). <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Thirdly:</span></strong> with regard to his learning the sciences of tasawwuf from shaykhs who lacked knowledge based on the Qur’an and Sunnah, such as his shaykh ad-Dabbaas, who was illiterate and could neither read nor write, he – may Allah have mercy on him – fell into some mistakes and practised some innovations in worship, but these slips are superseded by the vast number of his good deeds. Nobody is infallible except the Prophets; all others are subject to error, and if the volume of water reaches two large vessels, it cannot be contaminated by impurity (as stated in the books of fiqh). <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fourthly:</span></strong> most of what is attributed to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilani of miracles (karaamaat) are exaggerated, and some of them are not soundly narrated. Of those that may be accepted, they either come under the heading of insight (firaasah) or of miracles (karaamaat) which Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah believe may happen, subject to shar‘i guidelines that are explained in the appendix to this thesis. End quote. <br /><br />Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-JIlaani wa Araa’uhu al-I ‘tiqaadiyyah wa’s-Sufiyyah, p. 660, 661 <br /><br />See also the answers to questions no. <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/12932" class="postlink">12932</a>,<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/45435" class="postlink">45435</a><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Secondly: </span></strong><br /><br />With regard to Mu‘een ad-Deen Chishti (Moinuddeen Chishti): <br /><br />1.<br /><br />His full name is: al-Khawaja Mu‘een ad-Deen Hasan ibn al-Khawaja Ghiyath ad-Deen al-Sijzi, who is known as “Ghareeb Nawaaz” (“the helper of the poor” or “the giver to the poor”). <br /><br />2.<br /><br />He was born in Sistan – in north-eastern Iran – in 536 AH and he died in 627 AH. <br /><br />3.<br /><br />He is one of the most famous awliya’ (“saints”) in northern India – if not the most famous of them – and his grave is one of the most shrines frequently visited by Sufis and those who believe in myths; it is even visited by Hindus! <br /><br />4.<br /><br />It was said regarding the reason for his embracing Sufism that whilst Mu‘een ad-Deen Chishti was watering his plants in his garden, he was visited by a Sufi man whose name was Shaykh Ibraaheem Kunduz. The young man Mu‘een ad-Deen Chishti approached him and offered him some fruits, and in return Shaykh Ibraaheem Kunduz gave him a lock from his beard and asked him to eat it! The “saint” Mu‘een ad-Deen did so, and he became enlightened and found himself in a strange world. After this incident he disposed of his garden and all his possessions, and distributed his wealth to the poor. He renounced this world and went to Bukhara to seek knowledge. <br /><br />5.<br /><br />Chishti travelled to many places, then he decided to go to India because of a dream in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to do so. So he went to India and stayed in Lahore, then after a short while he went to Ajmer – in the region of Rajasthan – where he settled and where he died. <br /><br />6.<br /><br />He is the founder of the innovated Sufi order that is known in India as the Chishtiyyah – after the town of Chisht in Herat, in north-western Afghanistan. <br /><br />7.<br /><br />The order of Mu‘een ad-Deen is no different from other innovated Sufi orders; indeed, some of these orders hold beliefs that constitute kufr (disbelief). <br /><br />In this order there is something that they call al-muraaqabah al-chishtiyyah (the Chishti meditation). This means spending half an hour a week at the graveside. The mureed (Sufi disciple) covers his head and recites dhikr, saying “Allahu haadiri Allahu naaziri (Allaah is with me, Allah is watching over me).” <br /><br />Undoubtedly this is an innovation and misguidance; indeed there is a fear that it may open the door to ascribing partners to Allah, may He be exalted, because the Sufi may be influenced by the occupant of the grave, and his thinking, meditation and focus may be for him, which comes under the heading of major shirk. <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Thirdly: </span></strong><br /><br />The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: <br /><br />I hope that you will do us the honour of writing for us some brief comments on Sufism and Sufis, what Sufism is, what their beliefs are, the opinion of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah concerning them, and what one who is of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah should do, or how he should interact with them if these Sufis insist on their beliefs, and they think that they are following truth even after the facts have been explained to them and have become clear to them. <br /><br />They replied: <br /><br />The word Sufism is derived from “soof”, meaning wool, because they wore garments made of wool, and that is linguistically more likely and closer to the reality of their way of life. With regard to the view that the word Sufism is derived from “as-suffah” because they are similar to the poor Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), who used to gather by the suffah (bench) in the Prophet’s mosque, or that it is derived from “safwah” (purity) because of the purity of their hearts and deeds, all of that is wrong and is not correct, because the adjective derived from suffah is suffi, and the adjective derived from safwah is safawi. These two meanings are not applicable to them, because in most cases their beliefs are corrupt and they follow a lot of innovations. <br /><br />All the Sufi orders (tareeqahs) or that which is called tasawwuf (Sufism) nowadays are full of actions that are innovated and constitute shirk, or the means that lead to it, as well as corrupted beliefs that are contrary to the Qur’an and Sunnah, such as seeking the help of the dead and the aqtaab (sing. qutb, meaning a holy man or saint) by saying “Madad ya seedi (Help, O my master)”, or “Madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab (Help, O Lady Zaynab),” or “Madad ya Badawi (Help, O Badawi)” or “Ya Dasooqi (O Dasooqi)” and other cries for help to the shaykhs and “saints”, believing that they can see into people’s hearts and that they have knowledge of the unseen and what the hearts conceal, and that they have secret powers that enable them to do extraordinary things, and calling upon Allah by names that He did not call Himself, such as “Hu Hu Hu” and “Ah Ah Ah.” <br /><br />The Sufis have innovated awraad (sing. wird) and du‘aa’s (supplications) that are not prescribed in Islam. They take a pledge from their disciples (mureeds) that they will mention Allah in their rituals and worship by particular specific divine names, in unison, such as saying “Allah, Hayy (Every-Living), and Qayyoom (Self-Sustaining).” They repeat it every day and night, and they do not recite other names of Allah except with the permission of their shaykhs, otherwise they would be disobeying their shaykhs and would be afraid of the servants of these names. They do all of that whilst swaying, bowing, rising, dancing, singing and clapping, and other actions for which there is no basis and that are not known in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). <br /><br />No Muslim should sit in their gatherings and he must avoid mixing with them, so that he will not be influenced by their corrupt beliefs, lest he fall into the same shirk and innovation that they have fallen into. He should advise them and explain the truth to them in the hope that Allah will guide them at his hands, whilst affirming those matters in which they are in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah, and denouncing those matters in which they go against them. In doing so he must adhere to the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah, so as to protect his religious commitment. Whoever wants to know about the Sufis and their beliefs in detail should readMadaarij as-Saalikeen by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah and Hadhihi hiya as-Soofiyyah by ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Wakeel. <br /><br /><em>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd. <br /><br />Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, vol. 2, 88-90 </em><br /><br />See also the answer to question no. <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/20375" class="postlink">20375</a> for the ruling on joining Sufi orders. <br /><br />And Allah knows best.<br /><br />-- <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> A brief look at Abdul-Qadir Jilani and Moinuddin Chishti, and their ‘aqeedah (doctrine) - islamqa.info - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://islamqa.info/en/143615">http://islamqa.info/en/143615</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 10:32 am</p><hr />

Soofeeyah Part 4 <br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Some Statements of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- About the Soofeeyah</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">1. There was more Bida’ amongst those who came later than those who were amongst the foremost of the people.</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) -Rahimullaah- said :<br /><br />‘This is because every time the people were closer to the time of the Messenger of Allah their Bida’ was less, and this type of Bida’ was (generally) in speech and statements.<br /><br />Those who committed Bida’ were not from amongst the Tabi’een (those who followed the Companions) and those who followed them, rather it was people who worshipped Allaah by dancing and listening to music. Just as there were people at that time from the Khawarij (those who rebel against the Muslim leader), the Mutazilah and the Shia, there were also amongst  them those who belied Qadr however, there were not  amongst these people of Bida’ those who used Qadr as a justification for their actions.<br /><br />Thereafter a lot of the Bida’ of action occurred amongst those people who came later, they were the ordinary (ignorant) worshippers and those who abstained from the Dunyaa, the poor people and the Soofeeyah. This Bida’ of actions was not generally present at the time of the Tabi’een and those who followed them, in contrast to the people of Bida’ and their  innovated statements. Because this Bida’ of statements appeared at the time of the Companions and those who followed the Companions, due to this it was known, and at that time doubts regarding Bida’ were stronger and their people were more intelligent, as for the Bida’ of the people nowadays who abstain from the Duniya and the Soofeeyah then their people are more ignorant and further away from following the Messenger of Allaah.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ vol.19/275, ‘Mawqif Ibn Taymeeyah min as-Soofeeyah’ vol.1/240]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2. The Dislike of the Soofeeyah for Knowledge.</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:<br /><br />‘As for the people who worship with Bida’, then the Shaytaan beautifies these acts of worship for them and makes them hate the paths of the Sharia’ until he makes them hate knowledge, the Qur’aan and Hadeeth. So they do not like to listen to the Qur’aan and Hadeeth nor do they like to remember it, and perhaps they are caused to hate books so they do not love books nor the one who has a book, whether it is a Mus’haf or a book of Hadeeth.<br /><br />Just as an-Nasrabaadthi said, the Soofeeyah used to say: ‘How can you leave the knowledge of (al-Kharq– a type of clothing that is specific to the Soofeeyah) and take the knowledge of the Sharia’ and knowledge!’ He said: ‘I used to hide my writing materials from them but when I became older they were in need of my knowledge.’<br /><br />As-Siree as–Saqtee mentioned that one of the Soofeeyah entered upon him and when he saw that he had a pen and ink he left and did not sit with him…..and many of the Soofeeyah frighten away those who mention the Qur’aan  or the Sharia’, or if he has a book with him or if he writes.<br /><br />This is because they feel that this type of person has in him something that oppresses his Tareeqah (path) so their Shayateen make them flee from knowledge, just as a Jew and a Christian causes his son to flee from listening to the speech of the Muslims so that he does not change his belief of his religion.  Likewise, the people of Nuh would place their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments so that they could not hear his speech or see him.<br /><br />Allaah Ta’ala said about the Mushrikeen:<br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt; And those who disbelieve say: ‘Listen not to this Qur’aan, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome.’&gt;&gt; [Fussilat: 26]</ul><br />And Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><ul>&lt;&lt;Then what is wrong with them (i.e. the disbelievers) that they turn away from (receiving) admonition?

Soofeeyah Part 3<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Is It Necessary To Adhere To A Shaykh From Whom To Take A Tareeqah (A Path)?</span></strong><br /><br /><em>Taken From A lecture ‘From the Principles of the Dawatus-Salafeeyah’</em><br /><br /><em>By the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani Rahimahullaah [1420H]<br /><br />Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />When a Muslim is guided to the path of goodness, some say that it is necessary for him to adhere to a Shaykh from whom he can take a Tareeqah (a path) because Allaah Ta’ala said:<br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt; the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well informed. &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 59]</ul><br />Allaah is truthful:<br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]</ul><br /> <br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh Answered:</span></strong><br /><br />And Allaah –Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – also says: &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]<br /><br />The Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said in the story of the man who went on a battle along with some of the Companions of the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. This man became afflicted with wounds, and in the morning he became defiled and thus it was obligatory upon him to have a Ghusl (ritual washing). He asked those around him if they could find a concession for him so that he would not have to make a Ghusl.  They said to him you must make a Ghusl, he did so and died due to those wounds that were upon his body, when that news reached the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–, the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said:<br /><br />‘They killed him, may Allaah fight them, if only they had asked when they did not know indeed that is the cure for any question.’<br /><br />There is no doubt that these two previously mentioned Ayaat and this hadeeth places the Islaamic world in regards to knowledge and ignorance into two categories.<br /><br />The first category are few in number and they are the people of knowledge and the other category are more in number and they are those who do not know, as you have heard in the previous Ayaah &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]   Allaah placed an obligation upon every one of these two types.  He made it obligatory upon those who do not know to ask the People of knowledge and He made it obligatory upon the People of Knowledge to answer the questioner as is authentically reported from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–:<br /><br />‘Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals that knowledge then he will be reined with a rein/bridle made of fire on the Day of Judgement.’ [Collected by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi &amp; authenticated by Albaani in Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb]<br /><br />It is necessary for the one who is not an ‘Aalim (scholar) that he should be a student of knowledge or at the very least he should ask the people of knowledge as is mentioned in the Athar from Mu’adh –Radi Allaahu anhu– that he said:<br /><br />‘Be a scholar, or one who learns knowledge, or one who listens to knowledge, and do not be the fourth and be destroyed.’<br /><br />The last one is the one who does not listen to knowledge nor asks about it, so at that time he lives like an ignorant person not knowing how to worship Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala.<br /><br />Asking the people of knowledge is an issue where there is a difference of opinion, as for adhering to a Shaykh, a Shaykh of a Tariqah (following a certain Soofi path), then here you have come to know that the path which reaches to Allaah –Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – is the straight path which the noble Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– left us upon.<br /><br />The scholars are those who direct/show/indicate this path, so they are the ones to whom it is obligatory to ask, and it is not permissible to adhere to a Shaykh and single him out to follow, and to learn from him and not to learn from the other scholars, because here occurs a great mistake which is that just like as it is obligatory upon us to single out Allaah –Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – Alone for worship, it is also obligatory upon us to single out the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– in following him and it is not allowed to stick and follow just one from amongst the scholars, no matter how this scholar from amongst them was from the excellent and standing, since this status is not for anyone, except the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and this is from the meaning of the statement of the one who witnesses that: ‘Ashhadu alla ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu (I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’)  so he is the one who has to be followed from amongst the people.<br /><br />If a Muslim adheres to one Shaykh or one teacher who teaches him, and he does not benefit from the other Mushayikh and other scholars from knowledge then this is violation of following the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–because it is necessary to take all the scholars as indicators/directors who show us what our Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was upon, and one single scholar no matter how much knowledge he has been given, and the matter regarding him and the right of every scholar, Allaah –Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – said: &lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little. </span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Al-Isra: 85] so this is an old superstition of the Soofeeyah that it is obligatory that every Muslim has to adhere to a Shaykh.<br /><br />We say: that it is obligatory upon every Muslim that he should be either a scholar or a learner or a listener or otherwise he will be destroyed.<br /><br />As for adhering to a Shaykh and singling him out alone then this is from the actions of the Shaytaan.<br /><br />We ask Allaah –Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – to give us all the capability to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah and what the Salaf as-Salih were upon and keep us away from following other paths, upon which at the head of every path is a Shaytaan calling the people to it.<br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt; And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way&gt;&gt; [An’am: 153]</ul><br />And all Praise belongs to Allaah.<br /><br /><em>[Taken from a tape: ‘From the Principles of the Dawatus-Salafeeyah’ 1/8/1410 A.H.

They shout, scream and dance together with what they call Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.409]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that Whistling and Clapping is Prayer</span></strong><br /><br />Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) -Rahimullaah- speaks about the Ayaah &lt;&lt; Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.  Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee commented on this by saying:<br /><br />‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.<br /><br />And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the Soofeeyah of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!<br /><br />Allaah is far from this.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.440]</em><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Soofeeyah’s Dislike of Knowledge</span></strong><br /><br />Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) -Rahimullaah- quoted:<br /><br />‘Ibn Baakwaya said: ‘One day Abu Abdullaah bin Khaffeef saw Ibn Maktoom and his group and they were writing something, so he said:<br /><br />‘What is this?’<br /><br />They said: ‘We are writing such and such.’<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />‘Busy yourselves by learning something and do not be deceived by the speech of the Soofeeyah.  I used to hide my pen in the pocket of my rags and the paper in the pocket of my garment and I would go in hiding to the people of knowledge, if they (the Soofeeyah) found out I was there they would dispute with me and say: you will not be successful, but then eventually they were in need of me (this knowledge).’<br /><br />Imam ad-Dhahabi (d.748) -Rahimullaah- said:<br /><br />‘This Shaykh had combined between knowledge and action and getting chains of narrations (Ahadeeth) from their sources, and would adhere to the Sunnan with a long enjoyable life in obedience to Allaah.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 16/346 – 347]</em><br /><br /><br />Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) -Rahimullaah- quoted Ghazali saying:<br /><br />‘Ghazali said: The Soofeeyah have taken to inspirational knowledge and not proper learnt knowledge, so one of them sits with his heart being empty, with total concern he says: ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah’ continuously so that his heart becomes empty. The Soofeeyah do not busy themselves with recitation of Qur’aan, nor with the books of Hadeeth.  So if the Soofi reaches this limit, then he stays in his house alone in the darkness and in a garment wrapped up, then at that time he hears the call of truth: <br /><br /><ul>&lt;&lt;O you (Prophet) enveloped (in garments)! &gt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muddathir]<br /><br />&lt;&lt; O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)! &gt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muzzammil]</ul><br />Imaam ad-Dhahabi (d.748) commented:<br /><br />‘The leader of creation indeed heard &lt;&lt;O you (Prophet) enveloped (in garments)!&gt;&gt; [Surah Al-Muddathir] from Jibraeel from Allaah. As for this idiot, then he never heard the call of truth, rather he heard the Shaytaan, or he heard it from his fickled brain and did not hear it in reality, and success is adhering to the Sunnah and al-Ijmaa’ (consensus).’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 19/322-346]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">A Rich Thankful Person and a Needy Patient Person who is Better?</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) -Rahimullaah- after discussing the issue of: ‘The difference amongst the people about a rich thankful person and a needy patient person who is better?’<br /><br />He mentions:<br /><br />‘The definition of al-Faqar (poverty – needy) according to many of the people, had become such that they regarded: al-Faqar to be Zuhud, worship and manners. They labeled the one described with Zuhud, worship and manners as a Faqeer (needy person) even though he possessed wealth.<br /><br />And they said about the one who is not described with Zuhud, worship and manners as not a Faqeer (needy person) even if he does not possess wealth, and perhaps it is possible that this meaning can be called Tasawwuf.<br /><br />And from the people there are those who differentiate between the title al-Faqeer (needy person) and as-Soofi, then there are from these people who regard the term al-Faqeer better, and from them are those people who hold the view that the title as-Soofi is better.<br /><br />Research into this issue shows that one should not look at innovated words, but one should look at what the Book and the Sunnah brought from words and meanings, indeed Allaah gave the description of His Aawliya which is that of al-Eemaan and at-Taqwa so whoever has a greater portion is better and the rich people are equivalent in regard to this, and Allaah knows best.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from ‘Udaatus Sabireen’ p.293]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ibn al-Qayyim’s Refutation Against the Soofeeyah in their Rejection of Knowledge</span></strong><br /><br />Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) -Rahimullaah- said:<br /><br />‘As for what is narrated about some of them [i.e. the Soofeeyah] in that they regard knowledge as insignificant and them being in no need of knowledge, then that is like the one [Soofee] who said:<br /><br />‘We take our knowledge directly from the living One, who does not die, as for you then you take it from one who lives and then dies [i.e. narrators of hadeeth].’<br /><br />Another one said when he was asked: ‘Why don’t you travel so that you can hear hadeeth from AbdurRazzaq?’<br /><br />He answered: ‘What can I do with narrating from AbdurRazzaq, when someone hears directly from the Creator?’<br /><br />Another one [Soofee] said: ‘Knowledge is a veil between the heart and between Allaah – Azza wa Jal – [i.e. Prevents you from reaching Allaah].’<br /><br />Another said: ‘If you see a Soofee busying himself with ‘Akhbarana’ (he informed us) and ‘Haddathana’ (he narrated to us) [These terms are used in narrating hadeeth] then wash your hands from him [i.e. keep away from him].’<br /><br />Another one said: ‘We have knowledge from numerical codes and you have knowledge from papers.’<br /><br />Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) -Rahimullaah- comments on their statements by saying:<br /><br />‘The best of the conditions of those who say these statements and other similar statements is that he is an ignoramus who can be excused for his ignorance. Or a negligent person who acknowledges his negligence, or otherwise if it was not for AbdurRazzaq and the likes of him [scholars of hadeeth], and if it was not for ‘Akhbarana’ (he informed us) and ‘Haddathana’ (he narrated to us) then nothing of Islaam would have reached this person and those similar to him.<br /><br />And whoever directs you to other than ‘Akhbarana’ (he informed us) and ‘Haddathana’(he narrated to us) then he has directed you to either, Soofee fiction, or philosophical analogy, or to his own personal opinion.  There is nothing after the Qur’aan or ‘Akhbarana’ (he informed us) and ‘Haddathana’(he narrated to us) except the doubts of the people of theological rhetoric and the opinions of the deviant people, and the imaginations of the Soofeeyah, and analogies of the philosophers. Whoever separates himself from the evidences then he becomes misguided away from the correct path, there is no evidence to lead to Allaah and Paradise except the Book and the Sunnah.  Every path which is not accompanied with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is from the path of Hell and the Shaytaan nirajeem (accursed Shaytaan).’<br /><br /><em>[Madarij   vol.2 p.438-439]</em><br /><br /><br />Imam Muhammad bin Idrees Sha’fiee -Rahimullaah- (d.204 A.H.) said in a poem:<br /><br />قال الشافعي رحمه الله<br />كل العلوم سوى القرآن مشغلة                            إلا الحديث وعلم الفقه والدين<br />العلم ما كان فيه قال حدثنا                                                                     وما سوى ذلك وساوس الشياطين<br /><br />Every knowledge other than the Qur’aan is a distraction *<br /><br />Except the hadeeth and the knowledge of Fiqh of the Deen *<br /><br />Knowledge is that which has ‘He said’ ‘he narrated to us’ *<br /><br />Everything other than that is whisperings of Shayateen *<br /><br /><em>[‘Dewaan ash-Sha’fiee’ (p.124), ‘Bidayya wa Nihiyya’ (10/254)]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/statements-of-the-people-of-knowledge-regarding-the-soofeeyah/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... soofeeyah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Mar 08, 2017 9:42 pm</p><hr />

It is also said that it is a word referring to the wearing of woollen (‘soof’) clothing, and this saying is the most probable since wearing woollen clothes was a sign of zuhd (dissociation from the worldly life). It was said that this was done in order to resemble ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam ‘alaihissalaam.<br /><br />Shaykh ul Islaam ibn Taymiyyah rahimahullaah mentions in al Fataawaa (11/7) from Muhammad ibn Sireen that it reached him that a certain people had taken to wearing woollen clothes in order to resemble Eesaa ibn Maryam, so he said: <em>“There are a people who have chosen and preferred the wearing of woollen clothes claiming that they want to resemble al Maseeh ibn Maryam. But the way of our Prophet is more beloved to us, and the Prophet sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam used to wear cotton and other garments.”</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Feb 12, 2017 12:12 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The famous Soofee leader – as-Sayyid Ahmad ar-Rifa’i – Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Baz [1420H]</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous Soofee leaders, as-Sayyid Ahmad ar-Rifaa’ee, which say that he visited al-Masjid an-Nabawee (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) in Madeenah and made du’aa at his grave, and the Messenger (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) reached his hand out to him and he kissed it? This is a widespread belief among the followers of his tareeqah (sect) and it is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century AH. How true is this story?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />This is false(hood) and has no basis of truth, because the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) died as decreed by Allah and as Allah said:<br /><br />{Verily you (O Muhammad sallallahu alayhe wassallam) will die and verily, they (too) will die}<br />(Glorious Qur’aan: Surah Az-Zumar, 39: v30)<br /><br />According to a Saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:<br /><br /><em><ul>«Allah has angels who travel about in the earth and convey to me the salaams (prayers and salutations) of my Ummah»</ul></em><br /><br />And he (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:<br /><br /><em><ul>«There is no one who sends salaams (prayers and salutations) upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his salaam»</ul></em><br /><br />And he (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said:<br /><br /><em><ul>«The best of your days is Friday, so send more blessings (salaah) upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will they be shown to you when you (your body) have disintegrated?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets»</ul></em><br /><br />And there are many ahaadeeth which say similar things, but it is not narrated anywhere that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wassallam) said that he would shake hands with anybody. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that was a Shaytaan (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray. What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and to adhere to His Sharee’ah, which is indicated in His Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and to beware of anything that goes against that.<br /><br />May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Sharee’ah, for He is the Most Generous.<br /><br />Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Ibn Baaz – Volume 9, Page 31<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-famous-soofee-leader-as-sayyid-ahmad-ar-rifai-shaikh-abdul-aziz-ibn-abdullah-ibn-baz-1420h/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-famous-soof ... baz-1420h/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Jan 27, 2017 10:00 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">THE REFUTATION OF MANY OF THE SUFI AHAADEETH BY SHEIKHUL ISLAM IBN TAYMIYYAH</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about the words which were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“My heaven and my earth could not contain Me, but the heart of My believing slave contains Me”</span></strong>? <br /><br />He replied:  Praise be to Allaah. <br /><br />What they mentioned is from the Israa’eeliyyaat [reports narrated from Jewish sources], no isnaad is known for it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What it means is that Allaah puts love and knowledge of Himself in the heart of His slave. <br /><br />The report, “The heart is the house of the Lord” is like the first report. The heart is the home or seat of faith in Allaah and of knowledge and love of Him.<br /><br /> They reported the words, “I was an unknown treasure and I wanted to be known, so I created mankind and taught them about Myself so that they would know Me.” These are not the words of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and I know of no isnaad for this, either saheeh (sound) or da’eef (weak). <br /><br />They reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah created reason, and said to it, ‘Come here,’ and it came. He said to it, ‘Go there,’ and it went. He said, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I have not created anything more noble than you. I shall reward and punish because of you.’” This hadeeth is baatil (false) and mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the consensus of hadeeth scholars. <br /><br />They narrate the words, “Love of this world is the root of all evil.” This is known from Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali, but there is no known isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br /><br />They report the words, “This world is merely a step for the believing man.” This is not known from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from the salaf of this ummah or its imams. <br /><br />They report the words, “Whoever is blessed with a thing, let him stick with it” and, “Whoever commits himself to something, let him stick with it.” The first report was narrated from one of the salaf. The second report is baatil (false), for whoever commits himself to something may have to stick to it or he may not, according to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Do favours for the poor, for tomorrow they will have authority, and what authority!” and, “Poverty is my pride and I boast of it.” Both of these are lies and are not known in any way in the well known books of the Muslims. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am the city of knowledge and ‘Ali is its gate.” This hadeeth is da’eef (weak); indeed it is mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the scholars of hadeeth. It was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others, but it is a lie. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The poor will sit down on the Day of Resurrection, and [Allaah] will say, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I did not deprive you of worldly things because you are insignificant. Rather I wanted to raise your status on this Day. Go to the place where the people are standing, and whoever gave you a piece of bread, or water to drink, or clothes to wear, take him to Paradise.’” The shaykh said: this report is a lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth. It is baatil (false) and goes against the Qur’aan and Sunnah and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’). <br /><br />They report that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, the daughters of al-Najjaar came out with daffs (hand-drums) and sang “Tala’a al-Badru ‘alayna min thaniyyat al-Widaa”, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to them, “Shake your tambourines, may Allaah bless you.” The hadeeth about women beating the daff on joyous occasions is saheeh, and this was done at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but it is not known that he said, “Shake your tambourines.” <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Allaah, You have brought me out of the place which is most beloved to me, so cause me to dwell in the place which is most beloved to You.” This hadeeth is also baatil (false), although it was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others. Rather he said to Makkah, “You are the most beloved part of Allaah’s land to me.” And he said, “You are the most beloved land to Allaah.” <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me and my father Ibraaheem in one year will enter Paradise.” This is a fabricated lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth. <br /><br />They report that a Bedouin prayed (quickly), pecking (like a bird) in his prayer. ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, “Do not peck in your prayer.” The Bedouin said, “O ‘Ali, if your father had pecked in prayer he would not have entered Hell.” This is a lie. <br /><br />They report that ‘Umar killed his father. This is a lie, for his father died before the mission of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I was a Prophet when Adam was between the water and the clay. I was a Prophet when Adam was neither water nor clay.” This wording is false. <br /><br />They report the words, “The bed of a single man is fire. Poor is the man who has no woman and the woman who has no man.” These are not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br /><br />It was narrated that when Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) built the Ka’bah, he prayed one thousand rak’ahs in each corner, then Allaah revealed to him, “O Ibraaheem, this is not like feeding a hungry man or clothing a man who cannot cover his ‘awrah.” This is obviously a lie, and it is not known in the books of the Muslims. <br /><br />They narrate the words, “Do not despise tribulation, for it will reap the hypocrites.” These words are not known from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br /><br />They narrate the words, “Whoever teaches his brother an aayah from the Book of Allaah becomes his master.” This is a lie which is not known at all in the books of the scholars. <br /><br />They narrate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I looked at the sins of my ummah and I did not find any greater sin than that of one who learns an aayah then forgets it.” If this hadeeth is saheeh, what is meant is forgetting in the sense of not reciting. The wording of the hadeeth is: “Among the sins of my ummah is that of a man to whom Allaah gave an aayah of the Qur’aan, but he neglected it until he forgot it.”  This forgetting means turning away from the Qur’aan and not believing in it or acting upon it. With regard to neglecting to study it until one forgets it, this is a sin. <br /><br />They report the words, “One aayah of the Qur’aan is better than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. The Qur’aan is the word of Allaah, revealed not created, and there is nothing like it.” This wording was not reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns something beneficial and conceals it from the Muslims, Allaah will bridle him with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” A similar meaning is to be found in al-Sunan: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever is asked about a matter of [Islamic] knowledge which he knows but he conceals it, Allaah will bridle him with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “When you come to talk about disputes which took place among my companions, be quiet. When you come to talk about the Divine will and decree (al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar), keep quiet.” This was reported with munqati’ (broken or interrupted) isnaads. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Salmaan al-Farsi when he was eating grapes, “Du, du,” meaning eat them two by two. These are not the words of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this is baatil (false). <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever commits zina (fornication) with a woman and she gives birth to a girl, the fornicator may marry his daughter who was born as a result of zina.” This was said by those who were not among the companions of al-Shaafa’i. Some of them attributed it to al-Shaafa’i, and some of the companions of al-Shaafa’i denied that he said that. They said, he did not state that this is permitted, but he did state that this is permissible in the case of radaa’ah (breastfeeding), if he breastfed from the milk of a woman who got pregnant as a result of zina. Most of the scholars, such as Ahmad, Abu Haneefah and others, are agreed that this is haraam, and this is the stronger of the two opinions narrated in the madhhab of Maalik. <br /><br />They report the words, “the most deserving thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allaah.” Yes, it is proven that [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, “The most deserving thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allaah,” but that was in the hadeeth about ruqyah (reciting Qur’aan and du’aa’s for the purpose of healing), and the reward was for the recovery of that sick person, not for the recitation. <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever mistreats a dhimmi (a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule), Allaah will be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection” or “I will be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection.” This is da’eef (weak). What is known from him is that he said: “Whoever kills a mu’aahid (member of a kaafir nation which has a peace treaty with the Muslims) for no lawful reason will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” <br /><br />They report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever lights a lamp in the mosque, the angels and the bearers of the Throne will not cease to pray for forgiveness for him so long as the light of that lamp is shining in the mosque.” I know of no isnaad for this from the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br /><br /><strong><em>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 5/88-93</em></strong><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/the-refutation-of-the-many-of-the-soofee-ahaadeeth-shaikh-ul-islaam-ibn-taymiyyah/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2012 ... taymiyyah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2017 10:39 pm</p><hr />

Sufism is an innovation, it is not from Islam.<br /><br />Thus it is upon those who have fallen into Sufism to repent to Allah the Exalted.<br /><br />And it is upon them to return to the Sunnah.<br /><br />And it is upon them to return to that which the pious predecessors were upon from uprightness and firmness upon the Deen of Allah and following the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and following the rightly guided successors.<br /><br />This is the pure unadulterated methodology.<br /><br />The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon him said:<br /><br /><ul>This nation will divide into seventy three sects all of them will be in the fire except one. They said: Who are they oh Messenger of Allah? He replied: Those who are upon what I and my companions are upon.</ul><br />Thus there is no safety and security except by following the Minhaj of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon, him and his companions.<br /><br />And Sufism is not from the Minhaj of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and it is not from the Minhaj of his companions, and it is not from the Minhaj of the virtuous generations; rather it is something newly invented in Islam.<br /><br />And it (Sufism) contains a great deal of deviations; some of which contains grave worship and shirk with Allah the Exalted and belief in the dead.<br /><br />Thus Sufism also contains polytheism.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Link to audio:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/sufism-is-not-from-islam-explained-by-shaykh">http://mtws.posthaven.com/sufism-is-not ... -by-shaykh</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2017 10:02 pm</p><hr />

They may be summarized as follows:<br /><br />1) Some Sufis like to link the name to Ahlus-Sufaah (people of As-Suffah) who were at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ). They claim that there are great resemblances between the Sufi adept and Ahlu-Suffa. Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah fleeing the persecution of the pagan Arabs. They were driven away from their homes and had neither money nor families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (ﷺ) and the companions (ﷺ) assisted them and he (ﷺ) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque. The fact, however, is that those poor Muslims resorted to the Mosque out of necessity. Their numbers increased at certain times and decreased at other times. Some of them stayed longer than others. So they were not a specific group united on something. Sufism in its early stages stressed the concepts of detachment from the worldly life, poverty, isolation, etc. The people of As-Suffah did not choose such concepts. They were in need and the Muslims helped them. They did not isolate themselves. In fact, they engaged in Jihaad whenever it was announced. When Allaah, the Most High, bestowed from His bounties upon the Muslims, some of them became free of want and were among the richest of the Sahaabah and others became leaders in some Muslim lands. The sufis would like to establish a linkage with the Prophet’s era and claim as well that he approved the early seed of Sufism exemplified in Ahlus-Suffah. In addition, and from a linguistic point of view, to derive Sufism from As-Suffah is wrong, because the correct term would be ‘Suffism’ and not Soofism.<br /><br />2) As-Saf al-Awwal (الصف الأول): Some Sufis claim that Sufism comes from As-Saff al-Awwal (First Row) “standing before the Hands of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, by virtue of the high determination and eagerness towards Allaah in their hearts and by positioning their innermost before Him.” This term is far from being linguistically applicable for if it were so, the term would be<br />Saffee (صفي).<br /><br />3) As-Safaa’ (الصفاء): Other Sufis claim that the term is derived from As-Safaa’ which means clearness, purity, sincerity. This is disputed by other Sufis and linguistically it does not fit. The derived term would be Safwee, Safaawee or Safaa’iee not Soofee.<br /><br />4) Soofah (صوفه): It is said that their title is derived from<br />‘Soofah,’ the name of some people who used to serve the Ka’bah in the pre-Islamic era (Jahiliyyah), and who used to go in seclusion in the Sanctified Mosque (Al-Masjid Al-Haraam). (1) Although this affiliation may be linguistically sound, it is rejected because:<br /><br />(a) The people of “Soofah” were not known well enough to be remembered by most of the early Sufis.<br /><br />(b) Had this affiliation been correct, it would have been known in the times of the Sahaabah. However, such an affiliation was not known then.<br /><br />(c) True devout worshippers do not accept to be affiliated with a tribe from the Jaahiliyyah times. (2)<br /><br />5) Sophia (سوفية): The historian and philosopher Abu Rayhaan Al-Bayrooni (d.440 AH) mentioned that the word “Soofism” springs from the Greek term “Sophia” meaning wisdom. The Greek were the first to speak of the concept of Wahdat Al-Wujood (Unity of Existence: that all existence is a single reality which is Allaah, and that everything we see is one aspect of Allaah’s Essence). Though one cannot confirm nor deny the authenticity of this derivation, it is certain that Sufism during its course of development was highly influenced by the Greek and Hindu philosophies.<br /><br />6) As-Soof (الصوف): Many Sufis from the past and present consider that the term Sufism refers to the wearing of woolen clothing (Soof). This is also the opinion of Shaykh- ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah. Also Ibn Khaldoon inclined to this opinion in his famous Muqaddimah. Many orientalists are also of this view. Although this is the most common opinion regarding the derivation of the term, it is disputed by some Sufis like Al-Qushayree (d.465 AH) who claimed that the Sufis were not specialized in wearing woolen clothes.4 Nevertheless, the desire by many Sufis to affiliate their name with this origin explains their exaggeration in matters of worship, detachment from the worldly life, abandoning lawful means of earning, property, children, etc. On the other hand, wearing woolen clothes is not something meriteous or raises the status of the Muslim with Allaah. Had it been so, the Prophet (ﷺ) would have preferred it to other clothes. In fact, he (ﷺ) disliked the odor of the wool upon sweating as related by ‘Aa’isha. She said:<br /><br />“I made a black cloak for the Prophet (ﷺ) and he put it on; but when he sweated in it he noticed the odor of the wool, he threw it away. The<br />narrator said: I think he said: he liked good smell.” (4)<br /><br />And in the agreed upon Hadeeth related by Anas, he (ﷺ) said:<br /><br />“The most beloved garment to the Prophet (ﷺ) to wear was the Hibara (a kind of Yemenese cloth made of cotton used to be from the best to wear).” (5)<br /><br />7) The term is not derived: This opinion is held by some important figures in Sufism like al-Qushayriee and al- Hajooyari (d.456 AH). They say it is just a given title. Such a claim is a strange and very weak one, because none of titles adopted by any sect lacks a meaning associated with it.<br /><br />These were the most important sayings regarding the origin of the word “Soofism”. Such differences regarding this term is due to the mystic nature that folds Sufism in esoteric concepts which is open to all kinds of interpretations Any sufi master could add his own methodology and concepts based upon his own experiences (Thawq). This rendered Sufism limitless in terms of its doctrines and ways. The case is even worse when it comes to the meaning of ‘Sufism.” One of the leading Sufi contemporary figures, Dr. ‘Abdul Hameed Mahmoud said: “The opinion regarding the meaning of it [At-Tasawwuf] did not yet reach a conclusive result.”(6)<br /><br />As-Siraaj At-Tusi (d. 378 AH) mentioned that the definition of Sufism exceeds a hundred, while As-Sahrawardee (d. 632 AH) related that the saying of the Sufi shaykhs about the meaning of Tasawwuf exceeds one thousand. One of the latter Sufis by the name of Ibn ‘Ajeebah (d. 1224 AH) related that shaykh Zarrooq (d. 889 AH) mentioned that it reached about two thousand definitions. The definitions describe Sufism as being linked to concepts and practices as well. They range from poverty, perseverance, seclusion, withdrawal from the world, secrecy, deception, depriving the soul, wondering, singing, dancing, wearing wool clothes, ecstasy, inward transformation, spiritual development, all the way to Wahdat Al-Wujood(7) In fact, careful study of its history and of its men, brings one to the same conclusion that there is no specific and comprehensive meaning of Sufism. Despite this, it can be easily said that it represents an accommodation of beliefs, experiences (highly stressed), philosophies, and methodologies of varied degrees of divergence from the Qur’aan, authentic Sunnah, and the way of the Salaf. Largely comprised within such accommodation are certain fundamental matters that shape Sufism, mainly:<br /><br />1-Limitless figurative interpretation of the texts and/or the sayings of their masters.<br />2-Classifying the Deen into Thaahir (Sharee’ah) applicable to the common Muslims and Baatin (Hidden) known only to the Masters and mystics.<br /><br />3-Accommodation of any deviation in matters of creed, worship, or morals. The extreme Sufis accommodate all creeds and all sorts of innovations.<br /><br />4-The deviated relationship between the Master and the disciple.<br /><br />5-The state of Kashf claimed by Masters in the Sufi orders in which they perceive and witness all of the realities of existence as well as those of the Ghayb (unperceived realities).<br /><br />6- Emphasizing Manaamaat (dreams), fabricated stories and/or ahaadeeth, as well as Shatahaat (intense and wild emotional state of excitement and agitation arising form what they call sudden Divine touches and during which the mystic utters unlawful innovated and mystic words, hallucinations and in many cases plain Kufr). Yet they say their utterances are due to the mystics being in a state of spiritual intoxication, e.g. “Praise be to me (subhaani),” and “Under my robe there is only god.<br /><br />ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ<br /><br />1) Imaam Ibnul Jawzee supported this view in his book Tablees Iblees, p. 201.<br /><br />2) See Majmoo’al-Fataawaa by Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah, vol. 11, p. 6.<br /><br />3) Ar-Rissalah Al-Qushayriyyah, p. 126, published by Daar al-Kitaab Al-‘Arabi, Beirut (1957).<br /><br />4) Reported by Abu Dawwod (English Translation no. 4063) and Ahmad in his Musnad (6:132, 144, 219, 249) and others.

Some jealous people twisted the fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah on travelling to visit the grave of Prophet peace be upon him and presented in front of Sultan, due to which he was jailed. They even forged his writings that he said visiting the grave of Prophet peace be upon him is prohibited by the consensus,  Ibn Kathir, Ibn Abdul Hadi, Muree bin Yusaf and many others  spoke against the forgery and defended him.<br /> <br />Ibn Kathir said when Ibn Taymiyyah was in jail:<br />وفي يوم الاثنين تاسع جمادى الآخرة أخرج ما كان عند الشيخ تقي الدين بن تيمية من الكتب والأوراق والدواة والقلم، ومنع من الكتب والمطالعة، وحملت كتبه في مستهل رجب إلى خزانة الكتب بالعادلية الكبيرة.  قال البرزالي: وكانت نحو ستين مجلدا، وأربع عشرة ربطة كراريس، فنظر القضاة والفقهاء فيها وتفرقوها بينهم، وكان سبب ذلك أنه أجاب لما كان رد عليه التقي ابن الاخنائي المالكي في مسألة الزيارة فرد عليه الشيخ تقي الدين واستجهله وأعلمه أنه قليل البضاعة في العلم، فطلع الاخنائي إلى السلطان، وشكاه فرسم السلطان عند ذلك بإخراج ما عنده من ذلك وكان ما كان، كما ذكرنا.<br />On Monday 9th Jamadi ul akhir Books, Papers, Ink, Pen were taken from Shaykh Taqi ud din Ibn Taymiyyah and he was prevented from books and reading. And in the start of Rajab his books were taken to the library of Adliya tul Kabeer. al Bazzarli said:  Those were sixty volumes and fourteen bundles of papers.  Judges and Jurists saw them and distributed among them. The reason for this was the response (of Ibn Taymiyyah) to the answer of Taqi ibn al Ikhnaai al Maaliki on the issue of (travelling to) visit (the graves), Shaykh Taqi ud din refuted him and declared him an ignorant and told him that his knowledge is little. Then al Ikhnaai  complaint against him in front of Sultan and Sultan ordered to take all the things from him. And then it happened what happened as we have mentioned already [al Bidaya wal Nihaya 14/157]<br /><br /><br />Scholars defending the Fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah on visiting the graves.<br />a) Ibn Kathir defended Ibn Taymiyyah against this forgery as he said:<br /><br />( دخل القاضي جمال الدين بن جملة وناصر الدين مشد الأوقاف وسألاه عن مضمون قوله في مسألة الزيارة فكتب ذلك في درج وكتب تحته قاضي الشافعية بدمشق قابلت الجواب عن هذا السؤال المكتوب على خط ابن تيمية إلى إن قال وإنما المحز جعله زيارة قبر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقبور الانبياء صلوات الله وسلامه عليهم معصية بالإجماع مقطوعا بها فانظر الآن هذا التحريف على شيخ الاسلام فإن جوابه على هذه المسألة ليس فيه منع زيارة قبور الأنبياء والصالحين وإنما فيه ذكر قولين في شد الرحل والسفر إلى مجرد زيارة القبور.<br />وزيارة القبور من غير شد رحل إليها مسألة ، وشد الرحل لمجرد الزيارة مسألة أخرى والشيخ لم يمنع الزيارة الخالية عن شد رحل بل يستحبها ويندب إليها وكتبه ومناسكه تشهد بذلك ولم يتعرض إلى هذه الزيارة في هذا الوجه في الفتيا ولا قال إنها معصية ولا حكى الاجماع على المنع منها ولا هو جاهل قول الرسول ( زوروا القبور فإنها تذكركم الاخرة ) والله سبحانه لا يخفى عليه شيء ولا يخفى عليه خافية وسيعلم الذين ظلموا أي منقلب ينقلبون ) أهـ<br />Qadi Jamal ud din bin Jamlah and Nasir ud din.. came to him (Ibn Taymiyyah when he was in prison) and both of them asked him regarding the meaning of his saying with regards to the issue of visiting. Then he (Ibn Taymiyyah) wrote to him on paper and under that Shafiee judge of Damascus wrote. I compared that answer to the writings of Ibn Taymiyyah. It was written that He (Ibn Taymiyyah) even said, Truth is that visiting the grave of Prophet peace be upon him and other prophets is sin according to consensus. Now see this is the forgery on Shaykh ul Islam. In this issue he (Ibn Taymiyyah`s) did not prevent people from visiting the graves of Prophets and Saaliheen. In fact he mentioned two sayings regarding traveling to visit the graves. Visiting the graves without travelling is one issue and travelling only to visit is another issue. Shaykh did not prohibit the visiting without the travelling. In fact he said it is preferable and allowed, he did not say it is a sin nor he said there is a consensus.  He was not unaware of the hadith of Prophet peace be upon him  where he said “visit the graves for they reminds you of the Hereafter” There is nothing hidden from Allah and no one can hide from him. And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.[Al Bidaya wal Nihaya vol 14 page 146]<br /> <br />b) Imam Ibn Abdul Hadi defended like this<br />هذا كلامه فانظر إلى هذا التحريف على شيخ الإسلام والجواب ليس فيه المنع من زيارة قبور الأنبياء والصالحين وإنما ذكر فيه قولين في شد الرحل والسفر إلى مجرد زيارة القبور وزيارة القبور من غير شد رحل إليها مسألة وشد الرحل لمجرد الزيارة مسألة أخرى<br />والشيخ لا يمنع الزيارة الخالية عن شد رحل بل يستحبها ويندب إليها وكتبه ومناسكه تشهد بذلك ولم يتعرض الشيخ إلى هذه الزيارة في الفتيا ولا قال إنها معصية ولا حكى الإجماع على المنع منها والله سبحانه وتعالى لا تخفى عليه خافية<br />This saying is forgery on Shaykh al Islam, his answer does not contains prohibition of visiting the graves of Prophets and righteous, he mentioned two sayings regarding travelling to visit the graves to take blessings. Traveling to visit the grave is an issue and visiting the graves without traveling is another issue.<br /><br />And Shaykh did not forbade visiting without traelling rather its desirable and allowed and his writings on Manasik are witness over it. He did not objected to this visiting in his fatwa, neither he said its a sin, nor he mentioned any consensus on its prohibition. And nothing is hidden from Allah Subhana watala [alUqood ad-Durriyah 1/357]<br />c) Imam Muree bin Yusaf (d 1033 h) defended like this<br /><br />He said:<br />فانظر إلى هذا التحريف الشنيع على شيخ الإسلام وكلامه مصرح باستحباب زيارة قبور المسلمين وجواز قبور الكافرين <br />See this UGLY FORGERY on Shaykh al Islam, who clearly ssaid It is MUSTAHAB to visit the graves of Muslims and it is allowed to visit the graves of Kuffar. [Shifa as-Sudoor fe Ziyarah al Mashahid wal Qaboor page 291]<br /> <br />He also said:<br />ومن العجب أن ابن تيمية رحمه الله قائل بزيارة القبور حتى قبور الكفار كما تقدم وكتبه فى الفقه ومناسكه فى الحج مصرحة بذاكك, ومع ذلك فتجد كثيرا من المتعصبين ومن يستحل الوقيعة بين أئمة الدين ينقولن عنه القول بتحريم زيارة قبور الأنبياء والصالحين، إما جهلا أو بغضا وعنادا ممن أشاع عنه ذلك في الأصل.<br />It is strange that Ibn Taymiyah May Allah be pleased with him is on the opinion to visit the graves, even the graves of Kuffar as mentioned previously, and his books on fiqh and Manasik of Hajj are also clear in this regard, However you will find a lot of fanatics disagree with the scholars of religion and transmits from them the saying of Prohibition of visiting the graves of Prophets and righteous, Either out of ignorance or they have bughaz and they are stubborn who propagate (this ugly forgery). [Ibid page 167 rough translation, see also al Kawakib ad-Durriyah bin Imam Muree bin Yusaf page 158]<br /><br />d) The scholars of Baghdad defending the Fatwa of Ibn Taymiyah<br />Imam Muree bin Yusaf and Ibn Abdul Hadi quoted the letters of scholars which were sent to Sultan in favour of the Fatwa of Ibn Taymiyah, including the letters of Maaliki scholars, Hanbalee scholars like Jamal ud din Yusaf al Hanbalee, Imam Safi ud din (Abdul Momin) bin Abdul Haq Hanbalee (d 739 h),  one of the letter from the scholars of Baghdad states:<br /><br /> فإنه لما قرع أسماع أهل البلاد المشرقية والنواحي العراقية التضييق على شيخ الإسلام تقي الدين أبي العباس أحمد بن تيمية سلمه الله عظم ذلك على المسلمين وشق على ذوي الدين وارتفعت رؤوس الملحدين وجابت نفوس أهل الأهواء والمبتدعين ولما رأى علماء أهل هذه الناحية عظم هذه النازلة من شماتة أهل البدع وأهل الأهواء بأكابر الأفاضر وأئمة العلماء أنهوا حال هذا الأمر الفظيع والأمر الشنيع إلى الحضرة الشريفة السلطانية زادها الله شرفا وكتبوا أجوبتهم في تصويب ما أجاب به الشيخ سلمه الله في فتاواه وذكروا من علمه وفضائله بعض ما هو فيه وحملوا ذلك إلى بين يدي مولانا ملك الأمراء أعز الله أنصاره وضاعف اقتداءه غيرة منهم على هذا الدين ونصيحة للإسلام وأمراء المؤمنين<br />When people of the cities of Mashriq and those who are living nearby Iraq heard regarding the restrictions against Shaykh ul Islam Taqi ud din Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Taymiyyah, This thing was hard on Muslims and It was burden on the supporters of religion, and the heads of Mulhideen are Raised, and the souls of people of desires and Innovation became happy. When Scholars came to know about this great calamity and when they felt that because of his imprisonment people of innovations and desires are mocking the great scholars and Imams then they brought this unpleasant and daunting news in the honest court of Sultan. They (the scholars) wrote fatawa in agreement of the fatwa of shaykh and mentioned the knowledge and virtues of shaykh... [al Uqood ad-Durriyah 1/367]<br /><br />Imam Muree bin Yusaf said after quoting these letters:<br />&quot; قلت والظاهر أن هذه الكتب لم تصل للسلطان الملك الناصر، إما لعدم من يوصلها أو لموت الشيخ قبل وصولها، <br /><br />I say apparently these letters were never received by Sultan Malik Nasir. either because there was no one to take them (to Sultan) or Shaykh died before they were received [al Kawakib ad-Durruiyah 1/171]<br />Note: When some people presented these letters of the scholars to as-Subki, he said without any evidence:<br /><br />&quot;I don`t know These are made up by those Shayateen who are not good in their works, or these are really from scholars but in reality they are ignorants.&quot; [Shifa as-Siqam page 301]<br /><br />But then he tried to reply the letters as will be shown below.<br /><br />e) Letter from a Maaliki scholar, Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman Baghdadi Khadim of a Group of Malikis from Madrassah ash-Shareefah al Mustansariyah<br /><br />Following letter was sent by  Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman Baghdadi  (701 h to 767 h) Khadim of a Group of Malikis from Madrassah ash-Shareefah al Mustansariyah stated:<br /><br />ما أجاب به الشيخ الأجل الأوحد بقية السلف وقدوة الخلف رئيس المحققين وخلاصة المدققين تقي الملة والحق والدين<br />من الخلاف في هذه المسألة صحيح منقول في غير ما كتاب من كتب أهل العلم لا اعتراض عليه في ذلك إذ ليس في ذلك ثلب لرسول الله ولا غض من قدره<br />وقد نص الشيخ أبو محمد الجويني في كتبه على تحريم السفر لزيارة القبور وهذا اختيار القاضي الإمام عياض بن موسى بن عياض في إكماله وهو من أفضل المتأخرين من أصحابنا<br />ومن المدونة ومن قال على المشي إلى المدينة أو بين المقدس فلا يأتيهما أصلا إلا أن يريد الصلاة في مسجديهما فليأتهما<br />فلم يجعل نذر زيارة قبره طاعة يجب الوفاء بها إذ من أصلنا أن من نذر طاعة لزمه الوفاء بها كان من جنسها ما هو واجب بالشرع كما هو مذهب أبي حنيفة أو لم يكن<br />قال القاضي أبو اسحق اسمعيل بن اسحق عقيب هذه المسألة ولولا الصلاة فيهما لما لزمه إتيانهما ولو كان نذر زيارة طاعة لما لزمه ذلك<br />وقد ذكر ذلك القيرواني في تقريبه والشيخ ابن سيرين في تنبيهه وفي المبسوط قال مالك ومن نذر المشي إلى مسجد من المساجد ليصلي فيه قال فإني أكره ذلك له لقوله لاتعمل المطي إلا إلى ثلاثة مساجد المسجد الحرام ومسجد بيت المقدس ومسجدي هذا وروى محمد بن المواز في الموازية إلا أن يكون قريبا فيلزمه الوفاء لأنه ليس بشد رحل<br />وقد قال الشيخ أبو عمر بن عبد البر في كتابه التمهيد يحرم على المسلمين أن يتخذوا قبور الأنبياء والصالحين مساجد<br />وحيث تقرر هذا فلا يجوز أن ينسب من أجاب في هذه المسألة بأنه سفر منهي عنه إلى الكفر فمن كفره بذلك من غير موجب فإن كان مستبيحا ذلك فهو كافر وإلا فهو فاسق<br />قال الإمام أبو عبد الله محمد بن علي المازري في كتاب المعلم من كفر أحدا من أهل القبلة فإن كان مستبيحا ذلك فقد كفر وإلا فهو فاسق يجب على الحاكم إذا رفع أمره إليه أن يؤدبه ويعزره بما يكون رادعا لأمثاله فإن ترك مع القدرة عليه فهو آثم والله تعالى أعلم أه<br />He quoted Abu Muhammad Juwaini and Qaadi Iyaad regarding the prohibition of traveling to visit the graves. He also quoted Qadhi Ismaeel bin Ishaq Maliki (d 282 h), Imam Maalik, Muhammad bin al Mawaz, Ibn Abdul Barr, al Maazari, Shaykh Ibn Sireen, al Madawana in favor of Ibn Taymiyyah [, Al uqood ad-Durriyah 1/45, al Kawakib ad-Durruiyah 163-165]<br /><br />When as-Subki saw this letter he said This Maaliki is liar in his naql from Abu Muhammad Juwaini and Qaadi Iyaad because Abu Muhammad Juwaini and Qaadi Iyaad never said this [Shifa as-Siqam page 302]<br /><br />But this is a big mistake of as-Subki because Imam an-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar asqalani and others also mentioned same fatawa from Abu Muhammad Juwaini and Qaadi Iyaad. In fact even as-Subki himself mentioned these fatawa in &quot;Shifa as-Siqam page 295&quot; and said Imam an-Nawawi mentioned this fatwa in his Sharah Saheeh Muslim not in other books. But we know that Imam an-Nawawi is not alone in quoting this fatwa even Ibn Hajar asqalani and other Maaliki scholars mentioned this fatwa.<br /><br />Note: This Maaliki scholar is not a liar but a Scholar of Maalikis as said by Muhammad Makhloof and Abu Al-Abbaas Al-Hilaali Al-Filaali who wrote his biography, Muhammad Makhloof wrote a short biography on him in his book Shajarat An-Noor Az-Zakiyyah fi Tabaqaat Al-Maalikiyyah, He wrote, <br /> <br />“The polymath, well-versed, and ingenious scholar, the one who raised the banner of the Maaliki school in Iraq; he was a devout worshipper and one of the refined ascetic scholars. He studied at the hands of his father and other scholars. He authored many books, among them a commentary on Al-Irshaad written by his father, Sharh Mukhtasar Ibn Al-Haajib Al-Asli and Al-Fari; he also wrote a lengthy Tafseer and a commentary on Ilm Al-Khilaaf (science of legal differences among jurists) and other books in different areas of knowledge. He was born in 701 AH and passed away in 767 AH.”<br /> <br />see his biography on Islam web Fatwa No : 290407<br /> <br />f) Letter from a Shafiee scholar, Ibn al Katbi Muhammad Shakir Salah al-Din ad-Damishqi (d 763 h)<br /><br />He said<br />لا ريب أن المملوك وقف على ما سئل عنه الشيخ الإمام العلامة وحيد دهره وفريد عصره تقي الدين أبو العباس أحمد بن تيمية وما أجاب به <br /><br /> <br />فوجدته خلاصة ما قاله العلماء في هذا الباب حسب ما اقتضاه الحال من نقله الصحيح وما أدى إليه البحث من الإلزام والالتزام لا يداخله تحامل ولا يعتريه تجاهل وليس فيه والعياذ بالله ما يقتضي الإزراء والتنقيص بمنزلة الرسول <br />وكيف يجوز للعلماء أن يحملهم العصبية أن يتفوهوا بالإزراء والتنقيص في حق الرسول <br />وهل يجوز أن يتصور متصور أن زيارة قبره تزيد في قدره وهل تركها مما ينقص من تعظيمه <br />حاشا للرسول من ذلك<br /> <br />نعم لو ذكر ذلك ذاكر ابتداء وكان هناك قرائن تدل على الإزراء والتنقيص أمكن حمله على ذلك مع أنه كان يكون كناية لا صريحا فكيف وقد قاله في معرض السؤال وطريق البحث والجدل <br />مع أن المفهوم من كلام العلماء وأنظار العقلاء أن الزيارة ليست عبادة وطاعة لمجردها حتى لو حلف أنه يأتي بعبادة أو طاعة لم يبر بها <br />لكن القاضي ابن كج من متأخري أصحابنا ذكر أن نذر هذه الزيارة عنده قربة تلزم ناذرها <br />وهو منفرد به لا يساعده في ذلك نقل صريح ولا قياس صحيح والذي يقتضيه مطلق الخبر النبوي في قوله لا تشد الرحال إلى آخره أنه لا يجوز شد الرحال إلى غير ما ذكر أو وجوبه أو ند بيته فإن فعله كان مخالفا لصريح النهي ومخالفة النهي معصية إما كفر أو غيره على قدر المنهى عنه ووجوبه وتحريمه وصفة النهي والزيارة أخص من وجه فالزيارة بغير شد غير منهي عنها ومع الشد منهي عنها <br />وبالجملة فما ذكره الشيخ تقي الدين على الوجه المذكور الموقوف عليه لم يستحق عليه عقابا ولا يوجب عتابا<br /> <br />والمراحم السلطانية أحرى بالتوسعة والنظر بعين الرأفة والرحمة إليه وللآراء الملكية علو المزيد <br />In this letter Muhammad Shakir Salah al-din Shafiee stated after seeking refuge. He stated &quot;Can anyone think that traveling to visit the grave of Prophet peace be upon him will increase His status? or Will it decrease His status if someone do not travel to visit his grave? For sure this is not the case. It is understood from the sayings of Scholars that (traveling) to visit the graves is not a worship and whoever vows that he will travel and worship there then he should not fulfill his vow. Among our Later companions Qadhi Ibn al Kaj said this is Qurbah and it is obligatory to fulfill this vow. But he is alone in it and He has no support of Clear Naqal and Authentic Qiyas. In this chapter the true saying is the saying of Prophet peace be upon him &quot;&quot;Do not tie the camel saddle to set out a journey except the three mosques&quot; So whenever one travels to seek blessings apart from three mosques then he is going against clear prohibition, and going against clear prohibition is a sin or kufr. If this visiting is without traveling than there is no prohibition. [al Uqud ad-Durriyah page 359-361, al Kuwakib ad-Durriyah 162-163]<br /> <br />g) Abu Umar and Abdullah bin abi waleed Maaliki, The scholars of ash-Sham.<br /><br />They said in their letter<br /><br />السفر إلى غير المساجد الثلاثة ليس بمشروع وأما من سافر إلى مسجد النبي ليصلي فيه ويسلم على النبي وعلى صاحبيه رضي الله عنهما فمشروع كما ذكر باتفاق العلماء<br />وأما لو قصد إعمال المطي لزيارته ولم يقصد الصلاة فهذا السفر إذا ذكر رجل فيه خلافا للعلماء وأن منهم من قال إنه منهي عنه ومنهم من قال أنه مباح وأنه على القولين ليس بطاعة ولا قربة فمن جعله طاعة وقربة على مقتضى هذين القولين كان حراما بالإجماع وذكر حجة كل قول منهما أو رجح أحد القولين لم يلزمه ما يلزم من تنقص إذ لا تنقص ولا إزراء بالنبي<br />وقد قال مالك رحمه الله لسائل سأله أنه نذر أن يأتي قبر النبي فقال إن كان أراد مسجد النبي فليأته وليصل فيه وإن كان أراد القبر فلا يفعل للحديث الذي جاء لا تعمل المطي إلا إلى ثلاثة مساجد والله أعلم<br />They said: Traveling other than three mosques is not allowed. But If this traveling is for visiting the Masjid of Prophet peace be upon him, pray there, sending blessings upon him, and his companions is allowed with the agreement of the scholars. If the visiting is not to pray in the mosque rather only to visit the grave then there is dispute among the scholars in this issue that it is prohibited or allowed.... Then he quoted the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is not fulfilling the vow if the intent is only to visit the grave, and if the intent is to visit the mosque and praying there than it should be fulfilled. <br />[al Kuwakib ad-Durriyah 165-166]<br /><br />h, i) The letters of Jamal ud din Yusaf bin Abdul Salam al Batti al Hanbalee, and Abdul Khaliq al Khateeb<br /><br />Abdul Momin bin Abdul Khaliq al Khateeb started with Praising Allah and sending blessings on Prophet peace be upon him and quoted fatawa of Shafiees and Maalikis and ended with praise of Allah.<br /><br />Shaykh Jamal ud din Yusaf said<br />وما جاء من الأحاديث في استحباب زيارة القبور فمحمول على ما لم يكن فيه شد رحل وإعمال مطي جمعا بينهما The ahadith on recomendation of visiting the graves just means visiting the graves of the own city, these ahadith does not prove traveling towards them to attain barakah. [Al Uqud ad-Durriyah page 233, al Kawakib ad-Durriyah]<br /><br /> <br />j) Imam ad-Dahabi defended him in Tarjumah Shaykh ul Islam<br />ثم ظفروا له بمسألة السفر لزيارة قبور النبيين، وأن السفر وشد الرحال لذلك منهي عنه؛ لقوله عليه السلام: «لا تُشد الرحال إلا إلى ثلاثة مساجد» مع اعترافه بأن الزيارة بلا شد رحلٍ قربةٌ، وشنعوا عليه بها واستعتوا عليه، وكتب فيها جماعةٌ بأنه يلزم من منعه شائبة تنقصٍ للنبوة؛ فيَكْفُر بذلك، وأفتى عدة بأنه مخطئٌ في ذلك خطأ المجتهدين المغفور لهم، ووافقه جماعة وكبرت القضية؛<br />Then he raised the issue that travelling to visit the graves of Anbiya is not allowed because of the hadith of Prophet peave be upon him &quot;Do not tie the camel saddle to set out a journey except the three mosques&quot; with the acknowledgment that visiting without travelling is the source of qurbah. And because of that he was attacked and wronged. And a group wrote whoever  has forbade it, he has defected the nabuwwah and they did takfir because of it. Others gave fatwa that its a mistake like the mistake of mujtahideen and he will be forgiven because of that, this is accepted by a Jama`h and big judges. (end quote)<br /><br />Comment: So for great Judges Ibn Taymiyyah was forgiven because he has used hadith, sahaba and the sayings of scholars in his view. He was not the first in this view. Yes some wahdatul wajoodis did takfir and showed his forged fatwa to sultan, but they were refuted by the judges and scholars of his time and the scholars who came later including Ibn Hajar asqalani who said:<br /><br />، وعقدت له بسبب ذلك عدة مجالس بالقاهرة ، وبدمشق ، ولا يحفظ عن أحد منهم أنه أفتى بزندقته ، ولا حكم بسفك دمه مع شدة المتعصبين عليه حينئذ من أهل الدولة ، حتى حبس بالقاهرة ، ثم بالإسكندرية ، ومع ذلك فكلهم معترف بسعة علمه ، وكثرة ورعه ، وزهده ، ووصفه بالسخاء ، والشجاعة ، وغير ذلك من قيامه في نصر الإسلام ، والدعوة إلى الله تعالى في السر والعلانية<br />Many hearings were held against him in Cairo and Damascus, but there is no report that any of them said he was a heretic and there was no ruling that he should be executed, even though there were many people in government at that time who were strongly opposed to him, and he was imprisoned in Cairo, then in Alexandria. Despite that, they all recognized his vast knowledge and his deep piety and asceticism, and they described him as generous and courageous, as well as supporting Islam and calling people to Allaah in secret and openly. [introduction to al-Radd al-Waafir by Hafidh Ibn Hajar asqalani]<br /><br />and ad-Dahabi defended him by saying:<br /> وأوذي رحمه الله في ذات الله تعالى من قبل المخالفين، وأخيف في نصرة السنة المحضة، حتى سار على منارة، وعلى وضوح، ولكن الله جمع له قلوب أهل التقوى، وجمعهم على محبته، والدعاء له، وكبت الله أعداءه،<br />And he Rahimullah was harmed in his path to Allāh by the opposers, threatened because he aided the pure Sunnah until Allāh raised his lighthouse, and united the hearts of the people of piety upon love of him and supplication for him, and Allah crushed his enemies [quoted from al-Dhahabī by Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī in Dhayl Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanābilah (4/496-497) through his work Muʿjam al-Shuyūkh, quoted by Abu Zahra in Hiyat Shaykh al Islam page 777, Omar bin Saood quoted in Sharah Limiyah 1/7 from Mojam ash-Shuyukh]<br /><br />Imam ad-Dahabi said:<br />قلت وله خبرة تامة بالرجال وجرحهم وتعديلهم وطبقاتهم ومعرفة بفنون الحديث وبالعالي والنازل وبالصحيح والسقيم مع حفظه لمتونه الذي انفرد به فلا يبلغ أحد في العصر رتبته ولا يقاربه وهو عجب في استحضاره واستخراج الحجج منه وإليه المنتهى في عزوه إلى الكتب الستة والمسند بحيث يصدق عليه أن يقال كل حديث لا يعرفه ابن تيمية فليس بحديث ولكن الإحاطة لله غير أنه يغترف من بحر وغيره من الأئمة يغترفون من السواقي <br />“I say: He had knowledge regarding narrators, regarding their criticism and praise, and their category, and knowledge of sciences of Hadith, and ‘Aali and Naazil, and Authentic and inauthentic, with his specialization in Hifz of texts, so no one reaches his status during his time, not even near him... such that It would be true if said: “Every hadith (narration) which Ibn Taymiyyah does not know, is not a Hadith”. The (knowledge) is sorrounded by Allah (only) but the difference (between Ibn Tamiyah and other schoars is that) He was and ocean (of knowledge) and other scholars are streams which came out from it.<br />[Tarjumah Shaykh ul Islam by Imam ad-Dahabee p 241, dhaylh Tabaqat Al-Hanabilah by Ibn Rajab hanbalee 4/500, al Uqood ad-Durriyah by Ibn Abdul Hadi p 41, Shahadah az-Zakiyah page 41] <br /> <br />k) Imam al Ayni Hanafi said:<br />ولم يكن بحثه فيما صدر عنه في مسألة الزيارة والطلاق إلا عن اجتهاد سائغ بالاتفاق، والمجتهد في الحالين مأجور مثاب، وليس فيه شيء مما يلام أو يعاب، ولكن حملهم على ذلك حسدهم الظاهر، وكيدهم الباهر، وكفى للحاسد ذماً آخر سورة الفلق، في احتراقاته بالقلق،<br />Whatever he said regarding the issue of &quot;Ziyarah&quot; and &quot;Talaq&quot; is his Ijtihaad, which is allowed by the agreement. The Mujtahid get the thawab whether he is right or even when he is wrong. AND THEN THERE IS NOTHING IN HIS (THE FATAWA OF ZIYARAH AND TALAQ) WHICH SHOULD BE BLAMED AND CONDEMNED, envious tried to make his name bad by doing mischievous things. The last verse of Surah Falaq is enough in refutation of envious. he burns because he is anxious. [Taqreez of al Ayni on the book &quot;Radd al Wafir&quot;, Ghayat al Amani 2/157]<br /><br />He not even defended and praised ibn Taymiyah rather wrote a full Sharah on the book of Shaykh al Islam Ibn Taymiyyah by the name of &quot;العلم الهيب في شرح الكلم الطيب&quot; in which he said on page 32, that This book is authored by<br />الامام العالم العلامة الاوحد الرحلة الفهامة شيخ الاسلام والمسلمين: تقي الدين أحمد بن عبد الحليم بن تيمية الحرانى تغمده الله برحمته واسكنه بحبوح جنته وحين وقع نظرهم عليه انكبوا بالالتفات اليه<br />The Imam, The Scholar, The Allama.. The Knowledgeable Shaykh al Islam of the Muslims Taqi ad-Din Ahmad bin Abdul Haleem Ibn Taymiyah al Harrani May Allah have mercy on him and GRANT HIM THE BEST PLACE IN JANNAH..<br />Al-Ayni also said: <br />فمن قال هو كافر فهو كافر حقيق، ومن نسبه إلى الزندقة فهو زنديق، وكيف يكون ذلك وقد سارت تصانيفه إلى الآفاق، وليس فيها شيء مما يدل على الزيغ والشقاق<br />&quot;Whoever says ibn Taymiyyah is a kaafir then he is in reality himself a kaafir, and the one who accuses him of heresy is himself a heretic. How is this possible when his works are widely available and there is no hint of deviation or dissension contained therein.&quot; [Taqreez of al Ayni on the book &quot;Radd al Wafir&quot;, Ghayat al Amani 2/157]<br /><br />l) Taqi ud din as-Subki accepting the truth<br /> <br />He said in Shifa as-Siqaam page 265<br /><br />&quot;That's why most of authors while discussing the Manasik  say that it is expedient to visit the grave of Messenger of Allah peace be upon him along with that make the intention of going to Masjid al Nabvi and praying there. Those who denounce visiting graves in fact do not reject the visiting of graves but actually describe the way of Mustahb Ziyarah and that is to do the intention of going to Masjid also&quot;<br />He clearly said most of the authors say while making intention of visiting grave it is better to make intention to visit the Masjid al Nabvi and praying there. <br /><br />Note: Ibn Abdul Hadi was not alone in refuting as-Subki rather<br /><br />1. Abul Muzaffar Yusaf bin Muhammad al Hanbalee (696h to 776h) [Trustworthy Imam Radd al Wafir 1/131] wrote الحمية الإسلامية في الإنتصار لمذهب ابن تيمية in refutation of as-Subki.<br />and<br /> <br />2. Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Jamal al-din Yusaf ash-Shafiee Yemeni [Shaykh, The Imam, Allama see Ghayat al Eemani 1/623] wrote قصيدة في الرد على التقي السبكي والدفاع عن ابن تيمية in refutation of as-Subki. <br /> <br />When as-Subki said regarding Ibn Taymiyah after his death:<br />لو كان حياً يرى قولي ويفهمه ... رددت ما قال أقفو أثر سبسبه كما رددت عليه في الطلاق وفي ... ترك الزيارة رداً غير مشتبه<br />If he was alive, he would listen and understand that I wrote a refutation.. As I refuted on the issue of divorce and visiting the graves.. [Quoted by his student Safadi in al Wafi bil wafiyat 21/172]<br /> <br />Imam Abul Muzaffar Yusaf bin Muhammad (696h to 776h) [Trustworthy Imam, see Radd al Wafir 1/131] wrote: <br />الحمية الإسلامية في الإنتصار لمذهب ابن تيمية<br />in refutation of as-Subki, Just quoting two lines from it,<br /> <br />He said:<br />لكن إذا الأسد الضرغام غاب عن الـ ... ـعرين تسمع فيه ضج ثعلبه<br />كذا الجبان خلا في البر صاح ألا ... مبارزٌ وتغالى في توثبه<br />When the Powerful Lion (Ibn Taymiyah) is not in the Jungle, You hear the noises of the fox (as-Subki).<br />Coward ask for someone to come against him when there is no one in the ring.

قال شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية رحمه الله<br /><br />واسم الصوفية هو نسبة إلى لباس الصوف هذا هو الصحيح وقد قيل إنه نسبة إلى صفوة الفقهاء وقيل إلى صوفة بن أد بن طانجة قبيلة من العرب كانوا يعرفون بالنسك وقيل إلى أهل الصُّفة وقيل إلى الصفا وقيل إلى الصفوة وقيل إلى الصف المقدم بين يدي الله وهذه الأقوال: ضعيفة فإنه لو كان كذلك لقيل صفي أو صفائي أو صفوي أو صفي ولم يقل صوفي.<br /><br />مجموعة الفتاوى لإبن تيمية  11 / 195<br /><br />The word as-Sufiyyah (Sufism) refers to wearing woollen clothing, this is the (most) correct meaning. It was said that it comes from the word Safwatal-Fuqahā (the Elite Fuqahā) or from Sufah ibn Add ibn Tā'nijah, an Arab tribe that was known for its asceticism, or from Ahlus-Suffah (poor Muslims in Madeenah at the time of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم  who used to stay in the masjid), or from Mount Safa, or from the word as-Safwah (elite), or from the phrase as-Saff al-Muqaddam bayna yaday Allāh (the foremost rank before Allāh). All of these views are weak, if any of them were true then the word would be Saffi or Safā'ī or Safawi, not Sufi!<br /><br />Majmū al-Fatāwa ibn Taymiyyah 11/195 <br /><br />Translated by Authentic Quotes on Facebook<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=63">Abu Faatimah</a> — Fri Sep 02, 2016 4:50 pm</p><hr />
