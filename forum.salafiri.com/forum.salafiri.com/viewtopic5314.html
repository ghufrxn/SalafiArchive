				<h3>Encouragement For Newly Practicing Muslims</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Encouragement For Newly Practicing Muslims</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abu Hurayrah Abdur-Rahman bin Sakhr</span></strong> converted to Islam in the year of the battle of Khaybar. That was in the 7th year of hijrah. So he spent 3 years as a Muslim with the Prophet peace be upon him and narrated 5374 ahadith - the most than any other companion. He also became one of the most knowledgeable companions.<br /><br />Ibn Umar and his father said about him, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;...you were the most knowledgeable of the Prophet's salAllahu alayhi WA salam hadith.&quot;</span></strong> -Ahmad in his musnad 8/21<br /><br />Bukhari said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Abu Hurayrah was the best memorizer of those who memorized hadith in his time.&quot;</span></strong> -al-Isaabah 7/353<br /><br />The point is this...just because you converted or started practicing at a later age doesn't mean you cannot memorize quran, hadith, or become a scholar. Abu Hurayrah only spent 3 years with the Prophet and <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">he became from the most knowledgable</span></strong> by the permission of Allah. <br /><br />It is Allah who raises individuals and gives and takes from whoever He wills. So if you work hard, are sincere, and seek aid in Allah you too can achieve these goals.</div>
