As for wearing niqab then she has no need to wear niqab if there are no men around her, those who are not her close relatives. (Meaning those she can never marry) Thus she uncovers her face and she does not wear niqab.<br /><br />As for if there are men around her who are not her close relatives then she drapes her khimar over her face such that they do not see her. And when she wants to prostrate she uncovers her face so that her forehead can directly touch the place of prostration.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br />Masjid Tawheed wa Sunnah<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/can-a-woman-pray-wearing-niqab-answered-by-sh">http://mtws.posthaven.com/can-a-woman-p ... ered-by-sh</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><center><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TNXPW731FCI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></div>
