The servant of Abdullaah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), Naaf’e reports, “We were with Abdullaah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) outside of Madeenah and some people prepared some food for us to eat and whilst we were eating a shepherd was walked past with a flock of sheep. The shepherd gave Salaam and Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) returned it and asked him to join them in the meal. The shepherd replied he was fasting. Abdullaah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) was shocked as it was extremely hot and that the shepherd was also working hard. The Shepherd said he found these days to be extremely beneficial. Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma)  wanted to test the man so he said to him, “Sell me one of the sheep, we will also give you some of its meat and you can open your fast with it.” The Shepherd replied, “They are not my sheep but rather my masters.” Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) said, “Your master will not care if one sheep goes missing just saying a wolf ate it.” So the Shepherd replied,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Where is Allaah?” and he would say this loudly and he himself would point towards the sky.</span></strong><br /><br />When Ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) returned to Madeenah he met the shepherds master and freed the slave and gifted the sheep to him.” (Tabaraanee, Baihaqee in Shu’ab, Siyaar 3/216)  from Allaamah Irshaad ul-Haqq al-Atharee ‘s book ‘Paths of Salvation’ pg.158<br /><br />END<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">POINTS OF BENEFIT</span></strong><br /><br />The great importance of being honest and trustworthy.<br /><br />Knowing that Allaah is always watching.<br /><br />Allaah is above the seven heavens and this is not attributing a direction to him.<br /><br />Abdullaah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma) and those who were with him like Naa’fe the Taab’ieen acknowledging Allaah is above and this is not attributing a direction or place to him as if this was the case they would have reprimanded or corrected the shepherd as they knew about Allaah the Mighty and Majestic more than anyone today.<br /><br />Believing and knowing that Allaah is above by everyone and this being a basic and universally established understanding as the shepherd pointed above and he was a normal lay person.<br /><br />The shepherd asking the question where is Allaah and then answering it by pointing above, showing one can ask a rhetorical question and then answer it. Abdullaah ibn Umar (Radhiallaahu Anhuma), Naaf’e and others all agreeing with this by remaining silent.<br /><br />Being trustworthy and honest and the shepherds action and saying of where is Allaah and him pointing above warranting reward and merit.<br /><br />The permissibility of testing people.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2011/09/27/allaah-is-above-the-heavens-being-trustworthy-according-to-a-shepherd-abdullaah-ibn-umar/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2011 ... -ibn-umar/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2016 10:00 pm</p><hr />
