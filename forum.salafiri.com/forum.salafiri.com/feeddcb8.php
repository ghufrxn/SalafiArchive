Shaikh Badiʾ al-Din Shāh al-Rashidī al-Sindhī mentioned<br /><br />On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah (radiallahu anhu) he said, “On the day Makkah was conquered, Abu Qahafah (the father of Abu Bakr) was brought and his hair and beard were totally white like Thagamah. The Messenger of Allaah (salallahu allay wasallam said, “Change this with something (ie change the hair colour) and stay away from Black (colour).” (Transmitted by Muslim 2/199, with Nawawi, Nasai 2/239, Abu Dawud 2/123, Ibn Majah 1/266)<br /><br />So this hadith commands us to abstain and to keep away from dying the hair black and a command is something that necessitates something that compulsory or mandatory. Therefore anything that is in opposition to this is prohibited and unlawful.<br /><br />Allamah Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri said, “And his saying (salallahu allay wasallam) “Abstain and beware of the black colour is a clear evidence in the prohibition of dying the hair black.” (Tuhfatul Ahwadhi 3/57)<br /><br />On the authority of Ibn Abbas (radiallahu anhu) said the Messenger of Allah (salallahu allay wasallam) said: “There will be people at the end of time who will dye their hair black just like the breasts of pigeons and they will never smell the fragrance of Paradise.” (Transmitted by Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and Hakim said it has an authentic chain.) <br /><br />Haafidh Ibn Hajr said, “Verily this hadith is from the narration of Abdul-Karim al-Jazri, he is trustworthy and his hadith have been transmitted in the Saheehs and this very same hadith from him has been transmitted in Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Hibban and Haakim in their respective Sahihs via this route. Hafidh Dhiya ud-deen al-Maqdisi has also transmitted it in Ahadith al-Mukhtarah Mimma Laisa Fis-Sahihain also through this route.” (al-Qaul al-Musaddad Fi Dhab Ann Musnad al-Imam Ahmad pg.42)<br /><br />from Shaikh Badi al-Dins book Ilahi Ei'tab<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 2:48 am</p><hr />
