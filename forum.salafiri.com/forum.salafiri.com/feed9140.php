<strong><span style="color: #000080"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">This legal edict is to show the virtuous scholars do speak against the munkar as focussed as this fatwa which was issued 23 years ago explaining the position of the scholars. This is presented to show the erroneous vilification and repetitive narrative scholars are quiet, they don’t speak about the evil and munkar, they are paid agents on the payroll of the government and those who speak are locked up, hence these government scholars don’t speak etc etc…this fatwa is very clear in its meaning without the getting involved in the geo-politics or the internal affairs of Muslim countries.</span></span></strong><br /><br />This is taken from the Lajnahs website.       <br /><br />Bringing non-Muslim singers, paying for them, and listening to their songs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia<br /><br />Fatwa no. 20856 <br /><br /><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Your Eminence, there are many festivals that are held in our blessed country nowadays. These festivals rest basically on: Singing, bringing singers from inside and abroad, distracting people from what benefits them in their religion and in this worldly life as well as the fact that it is a kind of wasting money in things that do not please Allah. Could you kindly issue a Fatwa in this regard and warn our Muslim brothers against indulging therein? May Allah reward you and let Muslims benefit from your knowledge! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah's Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).<br /><br /><br />The Committee perused the question submitted to the Grand Mufti by some questioners and which was referred to it from the Secretariat General of the Council of Senior Scholars no. 1577 on 7\3\1420 A.H. The question reads as follows:<br /><br />Some notable people in our territory on such days (summer holidays) have some features in their celebrations such as: Inviting many singers, poets and actors from inside and outside the Kingdom when holding their various ceremonies and inviting people to attend them. We would like to ask about the following:<br /><br />1. What is the ruling on holding these ceremonies, which are full of singing and where musical instruments are used?<br /><br />2. What is the ruling on spending, encouraging and being pleased with them?<br />What is the ruling on bringing non-Muslim singers, paying for them, listening to their songs, encouraging them and being pleased with their presence?<br /><br />3. What is the ruling on the audience who listens to them?<br /><br />Could you kindly advise? May Allah reward you, because some people think these things are lawful and Shari`ah does not prohibit all the cases mentioned above? May Allah reward you! <br /><br /><br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: It is forbidden for a Muslim to hold a ceremony or festival which includes many abominable acts such as singing, free mixing between men and women and bringing sorcerers and charmers. There are abundant Shar`y proofs which prohibit these matters as they are from the means leading to committing what Allah has prohibited. Allah warns those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe and incite people to this, that they will have a painful torment. He (Glorified be He) says,  Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter.  If it is well known that holding these ceremonies and festivals are prohibited, then attending, spending money on and calling for them are prohibited too. It is a kind of wasting money in things that do not please Allah and cooperation in misdeed and aggression. Allah (Exalted be He) says, Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment. It is related in the agreed upon Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to forbid the wasting of property. <br /><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br /><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta' <br />Chair: Abdul Aziz b.

<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong><span style="color: #BF4000">Saudi Petrol Dollars and the Mud Palace</span></strong></span><br /><br />We can see from Sandra Mackey's book King Abd al-Aziz continued to reside in a <strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">MUD</span></span></strong> palace, which on account a large house in a Muslim country is perhaps normal, despite all the wealth he so called accumulated!!!! <br /><br />We also learn of his generous nature with his people and how we would away give the riches. Let not the shopping trips to the west be means to be bias. Its acceptable for the Nouveau riche to behave in this way and spend their wealth but when a group of people who lived in extreme poverty and in extreme conditions in tents and mud houses, had access to wealth, they spent it and then out comes the targeting agenda. They continued to spend it on their people in different ways. It goes without saying, to see how the country developed, this is not lesson to paint a picture of KSA and how they spent their wealth. The lesson is, KSA used the west to draw on their natural resources and the country prospered. What they did with their wealth is something we can share in a future post in terms of the Da'wah activities around the globe and how they championed Islam as opposed to Arab Nationalism, everyone was quiet on that front, how they helped the <strong>Islamists and how the Ikhwanis backstabbed them</strong>.<br /><br />Its silly and naive to bring the point of the west funding KSA and their oil project, as if its impermissible and if the Nabi Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not have any monetary interactions with the Non-Muslims. We also have a bias selectiveness in how the same people who attack KSA tend to forget in how the MUSLIMS in MANY muslim countries cooperated with foreign powers, business transactions and deals. Look at instance how many Muslims co-operated with the East India Company in the Subcontinent. This is a subject area that needs to discussed and explained at a further date.<br /><br />Therefore, to equate business deals and transactions with the British and the west set up the third Saudi state is ludicrous.<br /><br />Sandra Mackey, in her <strong><span style="color: #BF4000">&quot;The Saudis, Inside the Desert Kingdom&quot;</span></strong>  (First published in 1987 and then in 2002)<br /><br />Mentions the following, although not everything she mentions is accurate and true, the aspect we are sharing is corroborated with other supporting evidences. 1. The Mud Palace still exists and can be seen 2. The older generation of KSA have verified the generous nature of King Abd al-Aziz. It should also be noted that a country which is being attacked from every angle, the Ottomans, Rawafidh, the Sufi detractors, the secret plots of the British, Americans and internal strife were pressures in delaying the development of the infrastructure of KSA and neither has anyone claimed that KSA at the time were masters at development. They learnt from their lessons and built the country to what it is now. <br /><br />Here the aim is address the claim of the British involvement and the primary focus and the lies, deception and distortions that are being spread. <br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=207" class="postimage" alt="The Saudis Sandra mackey.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=208" class="postimage" alt="The Saudis S.

<strong><span style="color: #BF4000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Did the British Help the Wahhabi's and Create the Saudi State</span></span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">This is a hideous notion that is often perpetuated by the novice <strong>anti-Salafi</strong>, with little information, research and recourse to primary or secondary sources. A number of feeble arguments have been put forward by a varied group of people of different religious persuasions, all of which lack established facts. Then these false narratives are built on scanty information, which for most part have no correlation to the claim. In the following posts and elsewhere, let us look at these claims and bring clarity to the real issues. The days of <strong>&quot;Mr Hempher, The British Spy in the Middle East&quot;</strong> Or <strong>&quot;The Confessions of a British spy&quot;</strong>, unfortunately won't cut it anymore!!!</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">I must draw the readers attention to the common argument which is often put forth, that the British aided the creation of the modern Saudi state, or what is often referred to as the third Saudi state. One of the points that pretty much renders these baseless allegations futile is what really happened and the views of the British coupled with their support for the Ottomans during the Second Saudi State. It is therefore academic fraud to have bias selectivity and overlook the loyalty and support of the British for the  Ottomans, who did collude against the Sunni Salafi Muslims of Central Arabia. <br /><br />The following has been taken from the publication, <strong><em><span style="color: #000080">&quot;Mohammad b. Abdul Wahab, A Slandered Reformer&quot;</span></em></strong> of Masood Alam Nadwi.

<strong><span style="color: #FF0000">The correct way to form an opinion<br />Shaykh Abu Zaid Zameer حفظه الله </span></strong><br />〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰<br />There are two ways by which one could form an opinion about Islam:<br /><br />The first one is to form an opinion about Islam by studying its (authentic) sources (namely, the Qur’an and Sunnah). The second way is to form opinions off personal experiences that are either based on incomplete information or on anti-Islamic propaganda. The first method is not only based upon the correct principles of investigation but also on the values of justice and fairness, which the second method lacks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it appears that most people have adopted the second way to form our opinions. Consequently, Islam, which (according to its authentic sources) is a religion of mercy, appears to be peace-averse when seen through poor investigation and mal-intended, anti-Islamic propaganda.<br /><br />✏️<strong>English translation by Muaaz Gabbur</strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://t.me/shaykhabuzaidzameer/313">https://t.me/shaykhabuzaidzameer/313</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46555">SheikhAbdullah</a> — Sat Jun 20, 2020 10:32 am</p><hr />

The brother replied as a comment, which again was based on irrelevant points. Instead of acknowledging the pertinent points raised, after claiming that my initial article was poorly written with spelling mistakes etc and that he would not be resorting tit for tat, he does exactly the same. He runs with his sob story and then proceeds to take a swip at the articles I've written on the website.<br /><br />let me make a few things very clear to you, to even someone who has been in the dawah for 2 decades as you claimed and read this properly before you get angry yourself. (what did you think we were, the books of the brothers you illegally scanned and put up have been publishing books for 2 decades, don't play childish games)<br /><br />1. i am not angry, this has been done to us not now but for 2 decades, our urdu and english books.<br /><br />2. I did not drag your name in the mud, you did by behaving the way that you did, all of this was avoidable,  we spoke you nicely, you brothers did not even respond to your salafi brothers that aimed to resort to the innocent defence story. Had you wanted to work with us and resolve the issues you would have replied and you did not.<br /><br />3. you claim you only help out, which i thing is wrong firstly and secondly its more than helping, you actively promote they channel, i can share screenshots if you want. There is also other evidence too.<br /><br />4. Gad you just shared books, it would have bene different, but we have come to learn you and your team even scan the books, had it been that you just share whats already out there its a different matter. You have actually scanned the books yourself. <br /><br />5. you say you have screenshots of us sharing books too and that you have evidence. Try to understand this point before you present your so called evidence. You have scanned and shared thousand of books. We have if any shared handful and even that was in the past and if an admin did they were reprimanded and corrected, this is in the english group. As for the Arabic group, some of these books have been shared by the authors or publishers and it returns back to out original point of harming the Salafi dawn. That is, if others have scanned it and you are merely sharing it to help people that is a totally different matter.<br /><br />However, like the Kharijis in the west like Kalamullah and Sunniconnect who have gone out of their way to scan Salafi books and promote the deviated ones, you connect to them and the people, this is not right. the point is, you guys have actually scanned books of salafi publishers. <br /><br />i am not interested in working with you guys due to your attitude. You reckless approach to Salafi publishers and crying about your name, you should have thought about the honour of your Salafi brothers before your embarked on your quest to inadvertently destroy other Salafi publishers.<br /><br />I put up a simple request on Facebook to remove our books from your telegram channel and the other channels you operate. As for your other insinuations pathetic swipes, then i don't have any problem with that and i forgive you as my salafi brother, but your reckless attitude has to stop, we approached you in the brotherly way and you came out and said we will do what we want, and you hid behind the issue of it being researched. We will share the views of the Ulama and you will see how many of them were similar view to us. You mention sh Bakr Abu Zayd, then please do share what he said.<br /><br />The 3 publishers i mentioned, there is another 1 from USA and we are talking to 2 others in the UK. will take legal actions against you and all those named, due to your complicit participation in this regard. i don't care who you are.  <br /><br />Your attitude should been from the onset, brothers we are so sorry we will take your books down right away because we are sure you have other projects to finish. Look at this link (these are just some of them),<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/e-books-pdfs/">http://www.salafiri.com/e-books-pdfs/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /> these were potential books but when we fist published our book,s people counterfeited them reprinted them without permission and some people scanned them online for decades we had to put our books in PDF format. What are the names of your book and where are the PDF's?<br /><br />Because of you and the telegram channel, the publishers are thinking of never sending books to the USA, i know i will never be sending books to the USA.<br /><br />also, we know exactly who scanned the books because we don't distribute our books, we sell directly to consumers, therefore we have a trace on every book. 2. we have put certain marks on each book when he posted to know which copy goes to whom. And since i know it was to salamis, we don't want to go down this route but you forced us with your reckless and bad attitude. The brother the books went to and you will end up through legal rulings.<br /><br />You claim you can be contacted, you blocked me and ran off in a storm because of these legal implications, once again to remind you, you are part of this team and we believe instrumental in it, yet your playing the innocent card game. I have now blocked you, when you had the chance to communicate with us, you blocked me and then unblocked me to comment on my post. this is your 2 decades in dawn and tit for tat attitude you were talking about.<br /><br />if you want to contact me, then do so via nay other means.<br /><br />May Allah forgive us, Amin.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Jun 18, 2020 10:32 am</p><hr />

i mentioned in a post that brothers who copy and scan books of Salafi brothers are like the ISIS, the brother took exception and was upset by this. The reality this is true and since the advent of these so called brothers who without even listening or reasoning with what publishers have to say they continue in their quest to harm and tarnish even Salafi publishers.<br /><br />They say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Regarding the issue of copyrights, as in many things in the Religion, there is a difference of opinion. And unless one has thoroughly studied the subject he is simply blindly following a Fatwā that he heard or read and should therefore - at minimum - respect the opposing opinion. Below is a question and answer of Shaykh Bin Bāz (in Arabic and translated into English) regarding the issue. <br /></strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This is actually not a point that requires answering, using what we understand as legitimate difference of opinion does not mean that they are litigate, the truth and understanding of the scholars should he sough and understood in context. If there is for example Shaykh ibn Baz on one side, there are 50 others on the other. The Masala is based on the texts and what is correct not that their is a fatwa that then allows you to take the rights away of authors and publishers. Which you have been illegally and illegitimately violating. To make yourself feel better you assert have not understood the issues besides you and that even if they have an opposing view it is just based on taqlid. This is atrocious and a very poor line of argument, more surprising and astonishing that its come from a Salafi brother!<br /><br />Since you shared the fatwa of Shatkh Ibn Baz, the brothers heard this fatwa live in the late 90's, so we already know it. Inshallah i will share many others in the posts below, to see how throughly you have actually researched it.  <br /><br />they say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Anyone who is strict against the sharing of the PDFs should exit the group for his/her peace of mind. We will do our best not to harm any authors or publishers but we will share their works when necessary.  </strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This is reckless attitude, they say they will try their best not to harm authors or publishers. The authors and publishers HAVE BEEN SCREAMING OUT THAT WE ARE BEING HARMED. So despite this this reckless and haughty attitude continues. <br /><br />They then say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Some books are out of print for many years and the only option is a PDF. Many people live in lands where the actual books do not reach. Many people just do not have the funds. A real student of knowledge will always have the book when he is capable of doing so but when he can’t he will resort to these PDFs. Allāh knows best. </strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />So, look at how when their is no viable islamic lawful justification, we switch and go to the rare and most unique examples of when books are out of print. Thats excellent and a service to ummah to scan these books, no one is stopping you, but to equate this and hide the the scanning of recent books of small Salafi publishers is oppression and affecting Salafi Da'wah. Furthermore, if books are out of print, then just email and say, your book is out of print, we have scanned it and uploaded it. Then when you do share say to people brothers, make a small donation to the people who published it (if they are active) so that they can release more works. <br /><br />Lack of sales and everyone in the middle trying to make money affect the publishers, scanning their books just makes it so much worse, and if these mature Salafi brothers had even the slightest amount of respect for the Salafi dawn and they wanted the dawn to spread let them publish one book and lets see how they feel. <br /><br />They say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong>Many people just do not have the funds</strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />We agree, but we find this is not that significant. The cost of books to other daily products like clothes, shoes, 'sneakers' and a whole host of other amenities is no where near books. Brothers spend more on a meal out. Yes some book prices are very high and those who have prices that are that high should work on it. However, when people keep scanning books, the publishers raise their prices to cover costs, so illegal scanners and uploaders are to blame for it.<br /><br />Furthermore, i don't know of any publisher that wants publish only a handful of books, given the circumstances they would want to publish more and keep the prices low, but these people harm them so much under the guise of helping the poor student.<br /><br />You talk about poor students, we give snd ship free books to ever needs them and we don't even ask for a single penny, not even for postage and packaging. If people order books, we sent them other books for dawn and ask them to give them out. We keep our prices as low as possible. Book prices that the sufis and innovators would charge double or triple the amount.<br /><br />Instead of understanding the situation and making modifications of your ethos and ethics, you show reckless attitude and claim you will continue to share the books. Brother, we are not stupid that you can use irrelevant and non-pertinent examples to justify your operations that not only do they violate rights of Muslims but also your Salafi brothers, who  aim to get books out to people and defend the Salafi creed and Manhaj. We have over 50 books that we want to print, but since you scanned the books, we can't generate the money soon enough to publish other books. The claim that student of knowledge who are into books, will always buy books is true, but at the same token your encouraging those who should be reading and buying books to wait and get the PDF. <br /><br />We are publishers don't tell us whats right and wrong, the islamic law and rights are on our side, as you shall come to know. We share books for free, and distribute them not you. Our books have been printed without our permission in far countries, we don't say anything because they are not in the west and people will benefit, yet you come and tell us you are the saviours and helping the umma with your scans.<br /><br />you have not spoken with the truth about these matters, and i will continue to shed light in future posts when i have time. For example the claim you take from sunniconnect is not true. They share books of deviants. As for ISIS, because you don't even the reality it is pointless telling you, but i do suggest look into he matter properly.<br /><br />we even give books FREE, people can order FREE books from us and we can't do this if you still have that poor attitude. At one time we had 4-5 free books. Its really sad and upsetting that takfirois have bene doing this to salamis for years and your just like them, so this is the equation you got upset about.<br /><br />The sunni connect has pdfs of Sayyid Qutb's In The Shade Of The Quran Fi Dhilal Al Quran Syed Qutb, this is deviance we are talking about, and this is your salafi dawah, i think its poor and no excuses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Jun 17, 2020 11:12 pm</p><hr />

<title type="html"><![CDATA[General • Geocentrism v Heliocentrism]]></title>

<category term="General" scheme="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewforum.php?f=50" label="General"/>
<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=1577&amp;p=1697#p1697"><![CDATA[
Some Scientific Basis for the Geocentrism<br />[THREAD]<br /><br />DIVINE TEXTS <br />Islamic Nusus evidence this theory from the Quran, that is the first point. <br /><br />SCIENCE<br />Up until the 16th century Geocentrism was the adopted model. Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo then came up with findings showing the Heliocentric model, they went onto say the earth moves and has 9 motions. This theory was problematic - it was illogical. From that time, its been forced down on us with irregular evidences and basic models. There has always been an attempt to quash Geocentrism because it causes huge problems to Heliocentrism, so much so that no Geocentrism is questioned as if its so odd and strange. You need to remember, Heliocentrism is just an assumption. Despite Heliocentrism having a mathematical theory it has faced some several problems which has led to it proposing a “New Hypotheses”<br /><br />Taking on Heliocentrism is synonymous with the Rawafidh attempting to hijack early Muslim History and narrative, presenting it as the norm, that the events leading up to Karbala are set, unchallenged, this is of course ridiculous.  <br /><br />Before we look at some evidences proving Geocentrism we will show the premise on which Heliocentrism is based on is also in actually challenged and debunked. That is, Newton’s theory of gravitation, which has been refuted. His theory evidenced and supported Keplers elliptical motion theory. Refer to the following 5 sources to see this theory debunked.<br /><br />1 - Popper Karl Raimund (2002), The Logic of Scientific Discovery. Psychology Press, 513 page<br />2 - Duhem Pierre Maurice Marie (1962), The Aim and Structure of Physical. Theory Book published by Princeton University Press, 351pages.<br />3 - Davies (2003), The Newtonian Myth. Studies in History and Philosophy of Sciences, 34, 763–780<br />4 - Khiari (2011), Newton’s laws of motion revisited: some epistemological and didactic problems. Lat. Am. J. Phys. Educ., Vol.5, No. 1,<br />5 - Maxwell Nicholas (2014), Three Criticisms of Newton’s Inductive Argument in the Principia. Advances in Historical Studies. Vol.3 , No.1, 2-11.<br /><br />Newton and Einstein ‘laws of Relativity’ have also bene proven to be fundamentally wrong and the following researchers have shown huge gaps and problems in their theorem.<br /><br />1 - Escultura (2003), The flux theory of gravitation XVII. The new mathematics and physics. Applied Mathematics and Computation 138, - 127–149,<br />2 - Scharma (2006), Einstein derived Erest = Mrest cÇ from a NON-EXISTENT equation: A Discussion. The general Science Journal<br />3 - Afriat Alexender and Ermenegildo Caccese (2010), The relativity of inertia and reality of nothing.

Millennium relativity, The general Science journal<br />5 -  Mathis (2013), The greatest standing errors in physics and mathematics. Book (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://milesmathis.com/index.html">http://milesmathis.com/index.html</a><!-- m -->).<br />6 - Chun-Xuan Jiang (2014), The discovery of primordial gravitational waves is 100% wrong. The general Science Journal<br />7 - Lehmkurl Dennis (2014), Why Einstein did not believe that general relativity geometrizes gravity. Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern physics, Vol 46, Part B, Pages 316–326, (2014).<br /><br />Narlicar said if were to observe the moon for a few hours, it wont change its position in the sky. This is strange behavior, since here on Earth we are used to seeing the Moon move across the sky from east to west. (Jayant V. Narlicar (1999), Seven Wonders of the Cosmos. Cambridge University Press, 15)<br /><br />The Heliocentric theory and all other related theories, that have only been based on theoretical proposals have never been argued by terrestrial observations of the sky or through satellite images of the Moon. What then follows is that Galileo, an arch proponent of Heliocentrism, during his telescopic observations noted other “very interesting” (emphasis and wording mine) observations that he FAILED TO PUBLISH, which would have debunked the Heliocentric model. Why did Galileo do this, quite simply because he was a Mulhid, perverse and arrogance of the existence of Allah, The Most High. This line of critique on the Mizdar ‘Moons’ can be saved for some other time. Through deception was the Heliocentric model pushed through the modern era. <br /><br />Geocentrism<br />Experimental Data<br />1 - In 1887 Michelson-Morley provided physical date to support Geocentrism based on simple experiments showing the earth is stationary. They split a light ray into two perpendicular component paths, A and B, with both of them having equal length. Path A is in the direction of Earth’s motion while path B is at a right angle to A. One would assume due to Earths motion the time taken to travel path A would be less than the time taken in path B. However, this was not the case, both light beams arrived at the same time, proving the Earth is stationary (Michelson Albert and Edward Morley (1887), On the relative motion of the earth and the aluminiferous ether. American journal of science, Volume XXXIV, No 203 (1887)<br /><br />2 – Nasa’s findings show the Sun has a revolution around the Lactic Way Galaxy with a solar apex. The Suns orbit around the Galaxy is around 220Km/s and therefore its orbit period is about 240 million years. The apex being an imaginary point in Hercules constellation, near the bright star Vega, where the speed of the Sun is 20km/s. This therefore refutes the Heliocentric model. (Paul R. Weissman (2007), Encyclopedia of the Solar System, Second Edition , Chapter 1 - The Solar System and Its Place in the Galaxy, 1-28)<br /><br />3 -  Experiments conducted by Nicholas Tesla and Lammertink Arend show particles exist which travel faster than the speed of light. Tesla during his system of wireless transmission of energy, transmitted longitudinal electric waves through the interior of the Earth, which propagate at a speed of 1.6 times the light speed. Based on satellite data from Pioneer 10 and 11 Arend shows the existence of an “anomalous” Doppler shift in the radio signals received from these satellites. The Iraqi nuclear physicist, Bahjat Muhyedeen demonstrated that energy isn’t related to the mass and he proposed a new mass-energy equivalence formula (E= m*b*c, where b is a new derived universal constant in term of speed units and equal 0.2014 of light speed). The works of [19-23] in the quantum cosmology show the existence of a faster than light speeds particle. Physicists at the CERN laboratory, prove the existence of superluminal particles called neutrinos travel faster than the light speed. The mass-energy equivalence formula (E=mcÇ) is defined when “c” is constant and it is the maximum speed of light. Furthermore, when “c” is a constant, energy must be proportional to the mass, but in the case of neutrinos, we are in the opposite condition. The neutrino mass equal 0.06 electron volts (eV), which is far less than a billionth of the mass of a proton (1.67262E-27  kg=<br />0,938273 GeV) = 1,06959E-37 kg and energy = 106  GeV). As shown above, “c” is variable, mass is not related to energy, this formula must be revised. Since the general relativity formula, physically unproven and incompatible with quantum mechanics, is false, there are not any justifications for the Earth spinning.<br /><br />Tesla Nicolas (1905), Art of transmitting electrical energy through the natural medium.

If the Sun has an attraction force (as proposed by Helio’s) on planets to make them spin, we never actually perceive this motion. <br /><br />5 – Planetary  Motions – Clockwise or Anticlockwise<br />According to the Heliocentric model, planets motion constantly in an anticlockwise direction (west to east) around the Sun, except Venus and Uranus which both rotate clockwise (east to west). Véronique Dehant, Tim Van Hoolst (2014), Encyclopedia of the Solar System, Third Edition, Chapter 8 - Rotation of Planets, Pages 159-184. The retrograde (meaning in the opposite way) rotation of these two planets is a huge problem for the Heliocentric model because this should not be happening due to gravitational forces. A huge contradiction. Venus is closer to the Sun and therefore the gravitational force is much stronger compared to Earth and Uranus! Scientists have to this day offered up a whole host of arguments but they are wild and desperate guesses.<br /><br />6 – The Sun’s gravity<br />Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun is 58 millions km while Pluto, the furthest is 6000km. So, the Suns gravitational forces reach Pluto and keep it in orbit. However, due to the distance, the force of gravity on Pluto is immense in order its line of motion in orbit. The same force has to be applied to Mercury by default, which should make the Sun swallow up Mercury, but this does not happen. Another huge problem for the Heliocentric model.  <br /><br />Sun / Moon Observations<br />The Moon over a lunar month shows different rising positions, the crescents are explained by the Moons monthly revolution around Earth. This is problematic because we see the Moon during the night in the first half of the lunar month rising from its appearance point and continuing to revolve to the West until it disappears under the West Horizon. During the 14th Night the Moon goes across the sky from the extreme East to the extreme West. During the 1st and 2nd half of the lunar month the Moon rises from the West and East respectively, however its movement and direction is always from East to West. If the Moon followed Earths rotation from West to East, we wouldn’t observe these risings. Noting the positions of the Moon at Sunset in a lunar month gives us a movement showing the number 8, giving us Moon Kinematic. This also gives intertropical journey. So, if the Moon revolves around the Earth on a monthly basis due to the Heliocentric model, the shape should be elliptical and not the shape of the number 8, however this is not the case. <br /><br />Angle Between Earth Sun and Moon<br />One is familiar with the movements of the Moon. We know the movement of these bodies is regular and uniform. In the Geocentric model we find the angle between Moon/Earth and Earth/Sun is a constant and regular of 11.9°, sky observations also confirm this. This is not the case in the Heliocentric Model. (see Diagram).<br /><br />Time Change<br />Time on a meridian is the same. This poses a huge problem for the Heliocentrism model which argues the Earths orbit is titled at 23.5°. At equinox when the Sun is at the equator the time is even more identical. So, the Sun rises from the South to the North, it naturally means there should a difference in the Sunrise/ There is more to this approach but ive left it brief.<br /><br />Shadow On Earth<br />In the Geocentric and Heliocentric model the shadow of objects are different. What we actually observe in the world is based on the Geocentrism. In Geocentrism, the shadow is based on the Solar rays. This is important because this occupies a central position in a Muslims ibadah due to the shadow of objects for prayer times.  This is not the case with Heliocentrism. (see diagram)<br /><br />The Position of the Earth in Relation to the Sun<br />Heliocentrism, based on Keplers model argued the orbit of planets was elliptical (i.e. different diamters). If this was the case it would mean the Earth orbits at two sides would be closer to the Sun and on the two perpendicular sides the Earth would be further away. We also know, even 1° change in the Earths temperature would either burn Earth or cause glaciation. Nothing like this happens. No doubt you get the desperate answers but the premise of 1° stands.<br /><br />Earth has a volume, a weight and a revolution speeds (theoretical). In the motion dynamic, objects speeds are related to its weight. If the Earth has its different motions, the falling of the thousands of asteroids and meteors on the Earth every day must influence the motions velocities. These objects cause the decreasing of the speed and everything will be attached to the Earth surface, the duration of night/day will be longer. But nothing is observed and every day the numbers of meteors increase without any changes. In addition, in the heliocentric model, seasons result from 23.5 ° inclination of the Earth rotation axis to its elliptic orbit around the Sun. But, the defect of this model is the position of winter and summer in the orbit. Winter appears when Earth is in perihelion (closer position to the Sun); the temperature decrease is attributed to the Earth speed which become faster (34.145km/s) than the average speed (29.829km/s). Summer appear when Earth is in aphelion; the temperature increase is attributed to the Earth speed which is slower (28.851km/s) than the average speed. Theoretically, this supposes the presence of self-power for the Earth to enhance or reduce its velocity. This suggestion has no argument to admit. Then, this conflict allows the suspicion of the heliocentric model validity. Furthermore, if the earth revolves around the sun we must observe a clear parallax of the Sirius star, its size must be larger when the earth is closer. If we take the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun during the autumn equinox, after six months it will be in the opposite position (spring equinox) at a distance equal to 299 Million kilometers. Thus, an observer on Earth should observe places in the remote universe of 299 million km from its initial position. Subsequently, he must observe this star in larger dimensions and a different angle. Such situation never detected demonstrates the stability of the earth and refutes the heliocentrism theory. The calculation of gravitational force between Sun /Moon and Earth/Moon shows that this interaction is more important between Sun/Moon. Since, Sun/Moon attraction (4,38082E+20 N.m2 /kgÇ) is higher than Earth/Moon (1,98E+20 N.m2 /kg2 ), the Moon cannot spin around the earth and we never observe its evolution steps. This situation interferes with the observation.  <br /><br />Furthermore, the polar star is a stationary since it indicates the geographic north for peoples in Earth. The observations of sky at night in different times (for example, an hourly basis) show the same position of this star without any motion contrasting with the other stars. Such fact proves that Earth is steady. Also, if the Earth spins around the Sun in 365 days, its velocity must be 108.000 Km/h, this value is 84 higher than the atmospheric sonic speed (1200 Km/h). Taking into account the atmosphere characteristics, a direct consequence of this velocity is to perceive a huge sound (sonic boom) caused by this motion. But these sound never heard only if supersonic plane across the sky. This situation could be interpreted by assuming that the atmospheric layer acts as an insulating body. This hypothesis cannot be admitting since we listen to various types of sounds. As consequence, the inexistence of sonic boom testifies the stationarity of the earth.<br /><br />Kinematic<br />First, if the Earth has an attraction force that is capable to hold and attach the atmosphere during its rotation around itself, the Sun and the other motions, we cannot detect the wind. Nevertheless, observations show the presence of various categories of wind from light air up to gale wind (the speed can overstep 50 knots). This fact confirms the absence of Earth attraction. Second, coastal dynamics researchers show that direction and wave height are closely attached to the wind. If the Earth spins around itself with a speed of 1670 km / h we must find a single direction of the wave propagation which will be necessarily East (dominates direction and speed). But oceanographers have shown different wave propagation directions. The presence of a numerous directions of wave’s propagation, when the Earth is rotating, assumes a higher carrying wind speed. This assumption is not convincing since extravagant wind speed of 1670km / h (910 mile/h) destroys any sort of life on Earth rapidly. Regarding the Beaufort scale, the impact of a wind speed exceeding 70 mile/h on sea/ continental state causes catastrophic damage in the infrastructure and trees. By comparison of speeds we cannot admit any motion for the earth. Third, the presence of balancing rocks and stacking stones in lakes and rivers in numerous countries for several times is a powerful tool to reveal the earth stationarity. If the Earth rotated around itself, the Sun, the galaxy, the apex and for the universe expansions, these rocks would move in any direction. But, the immovability of these rocks for a long time shows the validity of the geocentric theory. In the hydrology science, water is maintained stable in lakes / rivers if there are not any atmospheric perturbations. The observation of enormous water bodies stable conflict with the Earth motions. This reality reveals that Earth is steady. The kinematic of the space rockets collide with the earth supposed dynamic. If we assume that the Earth makes different motions at the same time, it means it must travel far from the point of the rocket launch. Then, when the mission is accomplished it cannot find the position of the Earth which would be further away. In addition, the maximum speed of a rocket is 28000 km / h but the Earth’s speeds are much more important (108000 km/h, 220km/s). Since the speeds of the Earth are greater than the rockets one, they can never return to Earth. But, observations show that the rockets return quickly and easily to the Earth. Moreover, the satellites are located at a fixed distance from the Earth, if they move a meter we cannot pick up any signal (for example: satellite dish are placed in a well determined direction, GPS). Then, the obtaining of these TV channels diversity and the positioning at any times interfere with the Earth dynamics (revolves around itself (1670km/h), around the Sun (108000km / h), around the galaxy (220km/s) and for the expansion of the universe). Assuming the earth motions, these satellites must change their velocity permanently, to conserve its positions to the Earth. But, satellites don’t have a self-power allowing them to enhance or reduce their speed. Such result, testifies the earth stability. Moreover, if the Earth has it different speeds motions, we cannot obtain a high detection pictures from geostationary satellites or from the Moon. In fact, at such high speeds, the taken pictures must be blurry. The observation of diver’s high detected earth images conflict with these motions. Finally, on any clear night, a shooting star can be seen in the sky about every ten minutes (for example the Perseids meteors observed between 11 August and 13 August 2014). It is commonly observed that many more meteors are seen in the early morning hours, between midnight and sunrise; then, they are seen in the evening between Sunset and midnight. If the Earth has different motions, we cannot observe these meteors and cosmic rays every day bombarding the Earth’s surface. This situation could be explained by the existence of the Earth in the same position in the cosmos.<br /><br />based on the research of Touir J and Kharoubi A.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Jun 03, 2020 5:23 pm</p><hr />

The Respect and Status of the ʿUlamāʾ According to the ʿUlamāʾ<br />Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsari (d.1367/1948), Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidi al-Sindhī (d.1416/1996) and Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hadī al-Madkhalī<br /><br />Around 20 years or so ago, some burnt mujrim liars from Birmingham said: “[1] Who is Badīʿ al-Dīn, [2] where are his chains [3] who from the ʿUlamāʾ recommended him.”<br /><br />I have answered [1] by compiling a biography of him at the turn of the century. I answered [2] by showing Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn has over 140 direct chains back to the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, in terms of his knowledge, his study of the sacred sciences and Ḥadīth, and they were impeccable and pristine as they come, Wa Lillahil Ḥamd. Here is the answer to [3], and let’s see if you can get your head around this.<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ bin Hadī al-Madkhalī was a student of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī, and Shaykh Badīʿ was in turn the student of Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī.<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ bin Hadī al-Madkhalī refers to Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī as, “al-Muḥaddith Abuʾl Wafāʾ ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī.” (Tadhkīr al-Nābihīn Bisīr Aslāfahum Ḥufāẓ al-Ḥadīth al-Sābiqīn waʾl Lāḥiqīn, p.293.)<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ also said about him: “Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī was from the scholars of India, He resembled Ibn Taymiyyah in terms of this strong memory and firm comprehension and no one was able to debate with him. Many people were guided through him, Hindus Christians, deviant grave worshippers and others…” (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=62086">http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=62086</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br />Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī, the teacher of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī, was a formidable and fervent defender of the Madhhab of Ahl a-Ḥadīth. Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī (d.1367/1948) said about Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī in 1945ce during a conference in India, while introducing him to the conference: “Today the keynote speaker of this conference is a young scholar hailing from Sindh who is a specialist in Asmāʾ al-Rijāl.”<br /><br />And then Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hadī al-Madkhalī himself said about Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī: “Al-Shaykh al-ʿAllāmah al-Muḥaddith al-Faqīh, the one with deep comprehension, beneficial to the students and of great stature.” (Tadhkīr al-Nābihīn Bisīr Aslāfahum Ḥufāẓ al-Ḥadīth al-Sābiqīn waʾl Lāḥiqīn, p.292).<br /><br />Allāh raised the rank of these righteous and virtuous scholars, they were blessed with immense honour and respect. The ignorant ruwaybidah, will not take their place no matter how much they shout and scream.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sun Sep 09, 2018 12:22 am</p><hr />

Part 3<br /><br />The Hanafi Fiqh Chanel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.<br /><br />Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)<br /><br />Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.<br /><br />We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.<br /><br />Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.<br /><br />Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,<br /><br />“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani also said,<br /><br />“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)<br /><br />He also said,<br /><br />“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)<br /><br />From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.<br /><br />These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.<br /><br />This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.<br /><br />Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=143" class="postimage" alt="al-albani-.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br />Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani<br /><br />(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma’arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi’a, 1431H/2010ce) <br /><br />The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!<br /><br />Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.<br /><br /><center> <strong>iframe</strong> </center><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Mon Jan 08, 2018 11:40 pm</p><hr />

Part 2<br /><br />The Hanafi Fiqh Channels Recent video on Allamah Rabbani Imam Shaikh Muhammad Nāsir ud-Dīn al-Albani by the Bradford crew<br /><br />Hanafi Ash'ari's on the Hadith in Sahih Muslim - Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his Madhhab Fanatacism<br /><br />Yet again, recently the intellectual prowess of some people arose in Bradfud, the Ash'ari Deobandi's in conjunction with the ta'an ie slanderous accusation on the name Abu Hanifah as the Hanafi Fiqh Channel.<br /><br />They released a video on the categorisation and grading of Shaikh al-Albani concerning the ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. Posts of this nature will by no means explain or clarify such intricate and fine issues of the science of Hadith and illal. This inshaAllah, is to be addressed in due course.<br /><br />This manipulative presentation and associated distortions are nothing new from these Ash'ari Deobandi's, as their scholars, other Ash’arites as well underlings of this camp have presented other deceitful allegations. They alleged that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani also rendered some ahadith in Sahih Muslim to be weak, again this is not the place to enter into these issues.<br /><br />However, what I wanted to share was the horrible double standards these people employ and how they turn a blind eye to their own scholars, Shuyukhs they revere. It highlights how these people disastrously forget the true reality, yet under the guise of attacking and vilifying Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, they develop selective amnesia.<br /><br />This being said, we hope the honest reader who fears Allah and the last day can judge for himself and see the truth and the double standards.<br /><br />Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, the student of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the one who lauded the Deobandi Echelons and his understanding of the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani said<br /><br />“I first met Shaikh Abdul-Fattaah Abu Guddah in his city, Aleppo, more than twenty years ago approximately. I realised that he was a man who was bigoted towards the Hanafi madhhab such that he blindly followed it when in his mosque in Aleppo he agreed to the permissibility of treating someone with alcohol under the supervision of a skilled, Muslim doctor.<br /><br />So I said to him, “This is not enough. The doctor must also be well-acquainted with the Sunnah. For in the Sunnah, for example, alcohol has been described as being a disease and not a cure. So how can a Muslim doctor who knows the Sharee’ah prescribe a cure which the Prophet, صلى الله عليه وسلم, described as being a disease?!”<br /><br />So he said, “Perhaps the hadith is weak or not authentic!” I replied, “How can it be when it is in Sahih Muslim?” So he said, “We will go back and check it to make sure.”<br /><br />So one of the people who was present and he was a friend to both parties in the debate said, “So when you do check and find out that it is authentic, will you act upon it or what the madhhab says?”<br /><br />So he replied, “The madhhab!”<br /><br />(Hayat al-Allamah al-Albani Bi Qalamihi (p.38-41)<br /><br />So what does Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah say, he says he will check the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM because he considered it to be weak or the fact that he did not even know it was in SAHIH MUSLIM<br /><br />Dear readers, and we have not even directed our attention to Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari yet and this is not even the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />We will inshaAllah, with the permission and aid of Allah alone show the historical assertions the Hanafi Ash’arites have made concerning the Sahihs of Imam’s Bukhari and Muslim.<br /><br />Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sun Jan 07, 2018 10:03 am</p><hr />

Part 1<br /><br />There are a number of posts which are circulating on social media, all in all of which attempt to criticise, defame and undermine the continuous efforts and struggles of,<br /><br />Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1420H)<br /><br />Some of these people, and I say this politely, have demonstrated dire comprehension of intricate issues while others have manifested their innate hatred and animosity for this Allamah Rabbani, based on nothing but tassub, tahazzub and their ignorance.<br /><br />The life and efforts of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani are well known and comprehensively documented, and no one can deny this even if they tried. In reality we do not need to mention his virtues, his efforts and works. The words &quot;authenticated or graded xyz by al-Albani&quot; in almost every other Islamic book by friends and foes alike, is unprecedented virtue by any account.<br /><br />However, sometimes a general reminder to ourselves and to our mutual friends, puts things into perspective.<br /><br />Oh insignificant one's, Let us remind you of who al-Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani is.<br /><br />He was the man who was born in a european country, which was and still is virtually unknown, he was responsible for putting that country on the map for Muslims, academics as well orientalists. Who knew Albania except through our Allamah.<br /><br />He was forced to move from his country at a young age due to communism. He moved to Syria with his family who were strict practising Hanafis. They made fun of him in the classroom while he excelled beyond degree in his Arabic language, syntax and morphology compared to his fellow classmates. They would say what does this Ajami know.<br /><br />He was ostracised, shunned and thrown out of his family home by his strict hanafi family due to his firmness in sticking to the Quran and Sunnah.<br /><br />Poor and destitute, worked as an honest watchmaker, who would look for scraps of pieces of paper to write prophetic Hadith on, to the extent he would write complete volumes of books in this way<br />He would travel the city to the library and the locals would make fun of him due to him riding a bike, they ridiculed him nationally in their newspapers.<br /><br />He was imprisoned in syria by the mulhid bathists Alawite shias, numerous times for teaching the Quran and Sunnah as well propagating Salafi Dawah. He was put in prison repeatedly and tested with their evil plots time and time again.<br /><br />He was forced to move to Jordan, than UAE, then Syria again and then to Jordan, due to the hatred of the innovator heretics.<br /><br />He single handedly rebuked and took charge of chief innovators and clear deviants a like. These deviants were the heads of misguidance who misguided thousands to innovations and corrupt beliefs and heresies, from the likes of<br /><br />The heretical Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the chief innovator who reviled everyone from the Sahabah to the Great Salaf us-Salihin<br /><br />His student, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah the Asharite Hanafi apologist and proponent of the Deobandis<br /><br />The Syrian Sufi Asharite, Muhammad Said Ramadhan Buti.<br /><br />Then he dealt with, not 1, not 2 but three of the Ghumari brothers of Morocco, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abd al-Aziz.<br /><br />He took charge and held at Bay the evil heresies and ideas of Abdullah al-Harari ie the founder of the al-Ahbash and his cult beliefs.<br /><br />He answered and dealt with the rafidi arch liar, Hassan Saqqaf.<br /><br />Also the Deobandi and dubious Habib ur Rehman al-Azmi, who did not have the guts use his real name, he was also answered and subdued. <br /><br />And the list, by the permission and assistance of Allah alone is continuous.<br /><br />The man who checked over 30,000 ahadith and wrote over 200 books, some of which run into volumes!<br /><br />The man who single handedly organised the whole of maktabah Zahiriyyah library, which was one of the most important libraries of the Islamic world.<br /><br />The man who produced some of the most prolific students and formidable scholars this century has seen.<br /><br />And then......you have the audacity to attack this man with your childish and immature remarks!<br /><br />We do not go beyond bounds in praise of our Ulama and neither do we make open blind taqlid of them,<br /><br />However after praising Allah, we thank him for sending us this mujaddid. May Allah have mercy on him, forgive him and accept his efforts and servitude. Amin<br /><br />Oh ignorant ones, whoever you are, know your maqam and manzilah when you talk about<br /><br />*Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani*<br /><br />Your brother<br />Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sun Jan 07, 2018 9:54 am</p><hr />
