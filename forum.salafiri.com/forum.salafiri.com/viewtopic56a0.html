				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Are the Aayahs About Allaah’s Attributes Regarded as Being from the Precise or Unspecific Aayahs [Muhkamaat and Mutashaabihaat]?</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Questioner:</strong> A questioner is asking whether the aayahs and hadiths that talk about Allaah’s Attributes are from the precise [<em>muhkamaat</em>] aayahs or hadiths] or the unspecific ones [<em>mutashaabihaat</em>, cf: Surah Aali-Imraan 3:7] … as the Shaikh of Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said …<br /><br /><strong>Al-Albaani:</strong> From one angle, namely in that which is connected to the exact nature [i.e., the ‘how?’] of those Attributes, they are from the unspecific aayahs [al-mutashaabihaat, but] from the other angle they are not [regarded as being from the unspecific ones but rather are from the precise [muhkamaat] aayahs] in that they have a clear meaning.<br /><br />As we just said now that the saying of the Salaf, ‘Pass them on/relay them as they have come,’ i.e., as they are understood in the Arabic language and we mentioned the example of [Imaam] Maalik about that previously too. So in this sense they are not from the unspecific [aayahs], i.e., in that they have a [linguistic] meaning well-known in the Arabic language.<br /><br />But as regards the exact nature [of those Attributes they talk about] then they are regarded as being from the unspecific aayahs [mutashaabihaat], because it is not possible for us to know the exact nature [i.e., the ‘how?’] of Allaah’s Dhaat, and following on from that it is not possible for us to know the exact nature of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic’s, Attributes either.<br /><br />For this reason some of the Imaams of Hadith, like Abu Bakr al-Khateeb [al-Baghdaadi], author of the well-known [encyclopaedia], ‘The History of Baghdaad,’ [said that] the same is said concerning the Attributes as is said concerning [Allaah’s] Esssence/Dhaat, both in negating and affirming, that which is said concerning the Esssence/Dhaat is said concerning the Attributes.<br /><br />So just as we affirm [Allaah’s] Essence/Dhaat [i.e., His very existence] and we do not deny it–for such a denial is total and utter rejection [of Allaah]–then we say the same about [Allaah’s] Attributes: we affirm them and do not negate them, but just as we do not ask exactly ‘how?’ His Essence/Dhaat is [but still affirm it], then in the same way we do not ask ‘how?’ His Attributes are [but still affirm them].<br /><br />This is the answer to the question.<br /><br /><em>789 | Fatwaawaa Imaraat, 2</em><br /><br />Source &amp; Video: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/are-the-aayahs-about-allaahs-attributes-regarded-as-being-from-the-precise-or-unspecific-aayahs-muhkamaat-and-mutashaabihaat/">https://shaikhalbaani.wordpress.com/201 ... haabihaat/</a><!-- m --></div>
