				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Golden Advice Concerning Methodological Issues by Shaykh Sãlih as-Suhaymi from the Prophet’s Masjid (ﷺ)</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>Q &amp; A Session, Translated by Ismãeel Beaumont</em><br /><br />In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Bestower of Mercy<br /><br />This is a translation of a question and answer posed to ash-Shaykh al-'Allãmah Sãlih as-Suhaymi in the Prophet’s Masjid, Saudi Arabia after Fajr on 5th December 2014 corresponding with the 13th Safar Rabi Al-Awal, 1436.<br /><br />The questioner says,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“I came for ‘Umrah from Indonesia, all praises due to Allah and He granted me the opportunity to sit with you in this blessed gathering. My question is, some of the youth from our country who ascribe themselves to knowledge speak [ill] concerning some of the scholars specifically Shaykh so and so, and Shaykh so and so. What is your advice?</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Shaykh Sãlih as-Suhaymi may Allah preserve him replies,<br /><br />My advice is for them to seek knowledge and avoid the obstacles along the path, no matter which of the scholars is spoken about. It’s upon them to cling to the path, and to busy themselves with knowledge and worship. Remember O slave of Allah! Tell them to remember Paradise, the Fire, the Reward, the Punishment and remember the saying of Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{Man does not utter a single word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record].}<br />(50:18)</span></strong><br /><br />And the saying of Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.}<br />(17:36)</span></strong><br /><br /> And His saying, Blessed and Exalted is He,<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.}</span></strong><br /><br />And the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ),<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">((Whomsoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him say that which is good or remain silent))</span></em><br /><br />And his saying, (ﷺ)<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">((A person may utter a word (carelessly) which displeases Allah without thinking of its gravity and because of that he will be thrown into the Hell-fire the distance of seventy years.))</span></em><br /><br />And his saying (ﷺ) to Mu’adh may Allah be pleased with him,<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">((Control this (your tongue)))</span></em><br /><br />Mu’adh said, <span style="color: #0000FF">“Will we be held accountable for that which we say with it O Messenger of Allah?”</span><br /><br />He said (ﷺ),<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">((May your mother be bereft of you O Mu’adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell on their faces or on their noses for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?))</span></em><br /><br />And his saying (ﷺ),<br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF"><br />((Whomsoever can guarantee me what is between his jaw bones and his legs, I will guarantee for him Paradise.))</span></em><br /><br />So beware of entering into this fitna,[1] which many of the people have fallen victim to. Those who, towards Muslims, respect neither kinship nor treaty. Those who defame the scholars who nurture and cultivate [the people]. From them are those whose hair has become grey whilst he is calling to Allah upon clear insight. Be cautious of these people O servant of Allah! Distance yourselves from them and seek knowledge. <strong><span style="color: #FF8000">Busy yourself with that which will benefit you</span></strong> concerning the affair(s) of your religion and your worldly life. Convey my salaam to them and say to them, that it is binding that they fear Allah Blessed and Exalted is He.<br /><br />How many people have been deprived of good? How many knowledge-based seminars have been canceled due to their defamation of their brothers’ honour? How many people’s honour have they eaten? How many innocent people have they spoken [ill] about? How many people have they harmed?! And Allah will gather the opposing parties on the Day of Judgment [and everything will be settled]. Pay attention to this O servant of Allah! Leave off that which happens among the people, such as the bickering and arguing that occurs between some of the Salafis. Infallibility is for the Messengers. Beware of entering into it! We have clarified the guidelines for how to deal with one who has made a mistake. Even the one who makes a mistake from among them… [the Shaykh did not finish his thought]<br /><br />You have just heard the mistake made by some of the companions2, very serious and dangerous allegations. Had they been said in this day and age, the hasty would have taken these words and warned against their brothers and harmed them due to these allegations. These allegations are more severe than that which is ascribed to some of the brothers who are warned against [today]. So we must be cautious!<br /><br />By Allah, there is an important lesson to be learned in the story of ‘Aisha; a lesson for those who take heed. In it are tremendous lessons for the believer who is free of whims and desires, fanaticism, self-love, conceit, the illness of retaliation, and the illness of character assassination. Be cautious O servant of Allah! Be cautious! <strong><span style="color: #FF8000">Do not get involved in that!</span></strong> Distance yourself from those who constantly defame the honour of their brothers, the scholars and students of knowledge in their gatherings. Even the major scholars are not free from some of these people.3 I heard one of them, via his dangerous websites, speak ill about our Shaykh Muhammad bin Sãlih al ‘Uthaymeen and our Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al’Abbãd al Badr, saying that they do not know the correct manhaj, meaning that you should ask other than them about issues pertain to manhaj. Who is the one who knows manhaj if those [scholars] don’t know manhaj?! This situation is very dangerous! Protect your tongue before there is a day wherein no monetary value will avail you! Before you become of the mufliseen  (bankrupt)! Protect your tongue before you will be from among the mufliseen. The Prophet (ﷺ), said:<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">((Do you all know who the muflis (bankrupt one) is?))</span></em><br /><br />They said, <span style="color: #0000FF">“O Messenger of Allah. The muflis is he who has no wealth or property.”</span><br /><br />The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, <em><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;The muflis is he who comes on the Day of Judgment having performed Prayer, Zakãt, Fasting and righteous actions. [However, he insulted this person, falsely accused another, unlawfully took the wealth of that one, spilt the blood of this one, and hit that one.] His good deeds will be taken and given to those he wronged. If his good deeds are exhausted, the sins [of the person he wronged] will be removed and thrown upon him, then he will be thrown into the Fire.&quot;</span></em> Allah forbid!<br /><br />Note: no one should understand from me giving this advice about defaming the honour of the students of knowledge and scholars, because sometimes speech is misinterpreted and not understood according to the intent of the speaker (and Allah’s aid is sought) - nobody should understand from me that I prohibit refuting the deviants who are firmly rooted in deviance, those who were nurtured upon deviance, who got lost in groups and sects fighting one another, each group pleased with what it is upon.<br /><br />No, by Allah O servant of Allah, I don’t intend those people. In fact, it is incumbent to refute them with the sayings of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) and the narrations of the Salaf and refuting their falsehoods with clear evidences from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (ﷺ) whilst avoiding obscene speech, cursing and revilement. We have been prohibited from cursing the polytheists if it is feared that it will lead to them cursing Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ). How much more so with cursing the Muslim who fell into some opposition? Yes we refute him, the refutation is obligatory, but it should be preceded with sincere advice because the goal is to return the people to that which is correct. The goal is not to destroy [the Muslim]! The goal is to return the people to the straight path. If the person in question insists and persists in his opposition, and his innovation and his continuance with the people of innovation, then [at that point] it is obligatory to refute him with the legislative means built upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (ﷺ).<br /><br />However, O servant of Allah, beware of taking speech out of context. Beware of forcing [others to take your position]. &quot;So and so accompanies so and so, therefore he is a deviant.&quot; No O servant of Allah! The Messenger (ﷺ) used to visit the disbelieving tribes. &quot;We saw so and so accompanying so and so, so and so visited so and so&quot;<strong><span style="color: #FF8040">…it could be that the visit was for a reason and benefit greater than what you perceive! Be careful!</span></strong><br /><br />Yes, by Allah if he accompanies, participates with them in their rituals, defends them, and increases their numbers then by Allah! He is to be refuted. But beware of forcing your brother with that which is not binding upon him! Beware of forcing your brother with that which is not binding upon him! <strong><span style="color: #FF8040">Beware of taking his speech out of context!</span></strong> Beware of attributing to your brother that which he did not say! Beware of lying on him! Beware of believing gossipers! Beware of believing those who are quick to spread news! You have to verify [information]!<br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><br />{O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.}<br />(49:06)</span></strong><br /><br />[Allah says]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">{O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace &quot;You are not a believer,&quot; aspiring for the goods of worldly life}<br />(4:94)</span></strong><br /><br />Aspiring to be known! Aspiring to be different so that you stand out. If you find any means to interpret your brother's speech in a good manner, do so as ‘Umar said may Allah be pleased with him. He said that it’s upon you to search for an excuse for your brother as long as it is possible to do so. So fear Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, and guard your tongue from defaming the honour of the Muslims! <strong><span style="color: #FF8000">Beware of slandering the students of knowledge and the scholars who nurture and cultivate!</span></strong> Those who defend the Book of Allah from the distortion of the misinterpretations of the ignorant people. Guard your tongue! Guard your tongue!<br /><br />Indeed, a man is known by two [things]: his heart and his tongue. Purify your heart for the believers, and guard your tongue from <strong><span style="color: #FF8000">defaming their honour</span></strong>. Place the taqwa of Allah at the forefront of your mind. If you want to speak, or you’ve been requested to speak, or someone transmits some speech to you concerning your Muslim brothers, particularly the students of knowledge and scholars who nurture and cultivate.<br /><br />I request from the brothers that they spread this question with its answer in full, without any additions or omissions. The question with the complete answer. The question of the brother from Indonesia may Allah reward him with good, with the complete answer. I request that it is <strong><span style="color: #FF8000">circulated promptly</span></strong>, with no delay, as advice for our brothers, our children and our youth who have been afflicted with this.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Translated by Ismaeel Beaumont</span></strong><br /><br />Al Madinah an-Nabawwiyyah<br />The Prophet’s City (ﷺ)<br />21st Safar Rabi Al-Awal, 1436<br />Saturday 13th December 2014<br /><br />________________________________________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br />[1] The Shaykh is referring to the fitna of speaking ill regarding the scholars.<br /><br />[2] The Shaykh is referring the lesson he just gave concerning the slander of our mother ‘Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her).<br /><br />[3] Even the major scholars are spoken ill about.</div>
