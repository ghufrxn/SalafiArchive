				<div class="content">The ruler of Saudi Arabia, King ‘Abdul-‘Azīz Āl Sa’ūd (1876-1953 CE, رحمه الله) laid down as the constitution of the Kingdom the following:<br /><br /><em><strong>“All of the laws of the Kingdom will be applied in accordance to the Book of Allāh and the Sunnah of His Messenger and that which the Sahābah and the Righteous Salaf were upon.”</strong></em><br /><br />(See al-Wajeez Fî Sîratil-Malik Abdul-Azeez, p. 90-91)<br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />The great Scholar Imām Ibn Bāz (رحمه الله) said:<br /><br /><em><strong>“Allāh benefitted the Muslims by way of King ‘Abdul-‘Azīz – through him Allâh united their word, raised the banner of truth, aided His religion, established enjoining of good and forbidding of evil. Through him a great amount of good was achieved and immense bounties that cannot be enumerated except by Allâh. Then it continued with his sons after him until this land became a striking example of the Tawheed of Allâh, distant from innovations and superstitious beliefs. This Saudi State is a blessed state and its rulers are keen to establish the truth and justice.“</strong></em><br /><br />(Audio: Huqooq Wulâtil-Amr)</div>
