With regards to the statement of the Prophet sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam about the 70, 000 people who will enter Paradise without reckoning or punishment that they are people who “do not seek ruqyah”, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al ‘Uthaymeen rahimahullaah states:<br /><br />So if someone comes to a person who will perform ruqyah upon him, and he does not prevent him (from performing ruqyah on him) then this does not oppose his (sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) saying:<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">And they do not seek ruqyah.</span></strong><br /><br />Because there are three levels.<br /><br />The first level: that (the person) seeks for someone to perform ruqyah (upon him) - and this person has missed out on kamaal (completeness).<br /><br />The second level: that he does not stop someone from performing ruqyah (upon him); and this person has not missed out on completeness because he did not seek ruqyah nor request it.<br /><br />The third level: that he prevents the one who is to perform ruqyah upon him , and this is in opposition to the Sunnah. For the Prophet sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam did not prevent ‘Aaishah from performing ruqyah upon him. And likewise the Companions did not prevent anyone from performing ruqyah upon them because this does not affect (a person’s) tawakkul (reliance upon Allaah).<br /><br />(translated by Nasser ibn Najam - from al qawl ul mufeed of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al ‘Uthaymeen rahimahullaah , quoted in Mu’jam at Ta’reefaat p205)<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ittibaa.com/5/post/2011/12/conditions-for-the-permissibility-of-ruqyah.html">http://ittibaa.com/5/post/2011/12/condi ... uqyah.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Nov 19, 2016 11:23 pm</p><hr />
