				<div class="content">Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan said:<br /><br />[1]: <strong>Cleaning One’s Teeth</strong>: Using the siwaak (2) is a highly recommend Sunnah. There are many aḥaadeeth that mention the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) encouraged the use of the siwaak. Thesiwaak cleanses the mouth and removes foul odors. Usingit is from Islamic etiquette.The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>If it wasn’t for the fact that I do not want to cause hardship on my nation, I would have ordered that the siwaak be used for every wuḍoo.</strong> [Bukhaaree]<br /><br />[2]: <strong>Moisturizing One’s Hair</strong>: It is recommended to moisturize one’s hair every other day, just as the Messenger (salallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would do. (3)<br /><br />[3]: <strong>Looking at One’s Self in the Mirror</strong>: It is recommended to look at one’s self in the mirror when he finishes cleaning and beautifying himself. One looks in the mirror because there is a possibility that something needs to be adjusted or tweaked. Thus, one looks in the mirror before going out to meet people. This is the Sunnah. The Messenger of Allah (salallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to look in the mirror (4).<br /><br />[4]: <strong>Using Delightful Fragrances</strong> (5): This is done because all of the Prophets did so. It is also done so that a person’s scent is pleasant, not offensive. So, he applies fragrances when he generally goes to prayer, and specifically when he goes to Friday prayer (al-Jumu’ah). He also uses delightful fragrances in the circles of remembrance and when he goes to gatherings.<br /><br />[5]: <strong>Shaving the Pubic Area</strong>: It is recommended to remove the hair from one’s pubic area. This can be done by any means that serves the purpose. This is also from the ways of the Prophets.<br /><br />[6]: Trimming the Mustache Closely: So, one does not let his mustache grow long. Likewise, he does not shave it completely because that is considered a form of disfigurement. He leaves its origin. This is because the Messenger (salallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not command us to shave it completely; rather, he ordered us to trim it closely (6). This is a form of beautification for men.<br /><br />[7]: <strong>Trimming One’s Nails</strong>: From the way of the Prophet is to trim one’s fingernails and toenails, they are not to be left long. Leaving them long is considered ugliness and a resemblance to predatory animals.<br /><br />[8]: <strong>Removing One’s Underarm Hair</strong>: One also removes the hair from his underarms by any means that serve the purpose. This is because leaving hair to grow under the arms is ugly, and it causes an unpleasant odor.<br /><br /><em>Translated by: Abū Ādam Jamīl Finch, Umm al-Qurā University, College of Sharī̄’ah<br />Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Dhūl-Ḥijjah 21, 1432/November 17, 2011</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Footnotes:</span></strong><br /><br />(1) Ṣālih al-Fawzān, Explanation of Akhṣar al-Mukhtaṣirāt, vol. 1, pp. 75-83, abridged in places, [Dār al-‘Āsimah]<br /><br />(2) [<strong>TN</strong>]: Likewise, a toothbrush<br /><br />(3) Abdullāh b.
