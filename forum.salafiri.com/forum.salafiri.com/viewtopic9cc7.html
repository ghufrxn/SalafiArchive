				<h3>Ruling on Saying “Ju’muaah Mubaarak”</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong>Sheikh Fawzan was asked the following question:</strong><br /><br />Every Friday one of my colleagues sends me a text saying “Ju’muaah Mubaarak” and he continues saying that he hopes that I will add that to my cell phone greeting or to my greeting on the internet forums; what is your view of this?<br /><br /><strong>Answer: Sheikh Fawzan</strong><br /><br />This is an innovation, Allah has not sent down any authority for this action. This is an action that is not known or narrated in the Sunnah; it has not been narrated that the Muslims should congratulate each other on Friday; rather it has only been reported that they would congratulate each other on Eid Al Adha and Eid Al Fitr not on Friday.Therefore putting this is a text and encouraging others to do it is an innovation and from spreading innovation.<br /><br />–<br /><br /><strong>Sheikh Abdul Musin Al Abaad was asked the following question:</strong><br /><br />Based on the premise that Friday is a (Eid) holiday, is it permissible to greet each other saying, Ju’muaah Mubaarak or Ju’muaah Accepted?<br /><br /><strong>Answer: Sheikh Abdul Musin Al Abaad:</strong><br /><br />By Allah, we don’t know of anything that proves the validity of this. As for the two Eids then it has been narrated that the companions when they would meet each other they would say, “May Allah accept it from us and you” or “May Allah accept your obedience”.<br /><br />–<br /><br /><strong>The Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz was asked the following question:</strong><br /><br />What is the ruling on the statement Ju’muaah Mubaarak?<br /><br /><strong>Answer: Sheikh Abdul Aziz</strong><br /><br />There is no origin for sending out the greeting Ju’muaah Mubaarak on the cell phones. It is a bless day, no doubt.Allah the Exalted has singled us out with this day, and the Jews and Christians have been lead astray away from this day, but as for giving a greeting every Friday then we don’t know of any origin for this.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?p=112005">http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?p=112005</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2012/10/19/ruling-on-saying-jumuaah-mubaarak/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2012/10/19/r ... -mubaarak/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>What is the ruling on offering congratulations on Friday?</strong></span></span><br /><br />What is the ruling on offering congratulations on Friday, because now it is the custom in our country on Friday to send text messages and people congratulate one another on the occasion of Friday by saying “Jumu‘ah mubaarak” or “Jumu‘ah tayyibah”.<br /><br />Praise be to Allaah.Firstly: <br /><br />There is no doubt that Friday is an “Eid” or “festival” for the Muslims, as it says in the hadeeth narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This is a day of ‘Eid that Allah has ordained for the Muslims, so whoever comes to Jumu‘ah, let him do ghusl, and if he has any perfume let him put some on, and you should use the miswaak.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1098; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.<br /><br />Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing the special virtues of Friday:<br /><br />Thirteen: It is a day of ‘Eid that is repeated every week.<br /><br />Zaad al-Ma‘aad, 1/369 <br /><br />Thus the Muslims have three Eids: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, which come once every year, and Jumu‘ah which is repeated once every week.<br /><br />Secondly: <br /><br />With regard to the Muslims congratulating one another on the occasions of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, this is prescribed and it is narrated from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). This has been discussed previously in the answers to questions no. 49021 and 36442. As for congratulating one another on the occasion of Friday, what seems to us to be the case is that it is not prescribed, because the fact that Friday is an Eid was known to the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and they were more knowledgeable than us about its virtues, and they were keen to respect it and give it its due, but there is no report to suggest that they used to congratulate one another on Fridays. And all goodness is in following them (may Allah be pleased with them).<br /><br />Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on sending text messages every Friday and ending with the phrase “Jumu‘ah mubaarak”?<br /><br />He replied:<br /><br />The early generation did not congratulate one another on Fridays, so we should not introduce anything that they did not do.<br /><br />End quote from Ajwabat As’ilah Majallat al-Da‘wah al-Islamiyyah. <br /><br />A similar fatwa was issued by Shaykh Sulaymaan al-Maajid (may Allah preserve him), when he said:<br /><br />We do not think it is prescribed to exchange congratulations on Fridays, such as saying to one another, “Jumu‘ah mubaarak” and so on, because it comes under the heading of du‘aa’s and dhikrs, which must be based on a text (of the Qur’aan or Sunnah) because this is purely the matter of worship and if it were good, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would have done it before us. If anyone suggests that this is permissible, then that may imply that it is prescribed to say du‘aa’s and congratulate one another after having done the five daily prayers and other acts of worship, and du‘aa’ at these times was not done by the early generations.<br /><br />End quote from the Shaykh’s website (may Allah preserve him)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salmajed.com/ar/node/2601">http://www.salmajed.com/ar/node/2601</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If a Muslim prays for his brother on Friday with the intention of softening his heart and making him happy, and seeking the time when supplications are answered, there is nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />And Allah knows best.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://islamqa.info/en/134741" class="postlink">Islam Q &amp; A</a><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Video by Shaykh Abdul Aziz Aal ash-Shaykh - Saying &quot;Jumu'ah Mubaark&quot;</span></span></strong><br /><br />[youtube]https://youtu.be/WMOh9in9ZcY[/youtube]</div>
