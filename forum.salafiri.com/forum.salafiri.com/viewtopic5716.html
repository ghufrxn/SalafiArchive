				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">Shaikh Muhammad Hasan Rashid</span></span></strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Shaikh Muhammad Hasan Rashid was born in the mid to late 1940s in Baltistān, which is in northern Kashmīr. He started seeking knowledge at a very early age from his father who had travelled to Delhi and studied with the Ahl al-Hadith luminaries. The Shaikhs family was one of the very few families who had reverted to Sunni Islam from the Nur Bakhshia- a Shia sect with a mixture of Shi’ism, Sufism and some elements of Sunni Islam. <br /><br />The Shaikh travelled to Karachi via Islamabad when he was 16-17 years old and enrolled at the prestigious Salafi learning institute, Jamia Rehmaniyyah which had relocated from Delhi post partition. He them enrolled at Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad where he studied for a few years. He studied with some of the great scholars of Pakistan from the likes of Shaikh Karam al-Din Salafi, Shaikh al-Hadith Muhammad Abduh Falah and also with the Pakistani Hadith master, Shaikh Abd al-Ghaffar Hasan for over a year, with their chains going back to Shaikh Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi.<br /><br />He learnt and studied with some of the great scholars of this Ummah and spent time with them; from the likes of Shaikh Abd al-Aziz bin ʿAbd Allāh ibn Baz, Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, Shaikh Muhammad Amīn al-Shinqiti, Shaikh Hamad al-Ansari and many more. <br /><br />Then Shaikh Muhammad Hasan Rashid travelled to Saudi ʿArabia in 1965 and completed his studies in Jamia Islamiyyah, Madinah University until 1970-1971. Shaikh Wasiullah joined the following year and thus Shaikh Hasan was Shaikh Wasiullah’s senior. Shaikh Hasan then travelled to see Shaikh al-Albani around 1970-1971 to further his studies in hadith due to his profound love of it and the Sunnah, he remained with him for a short period of time.  Shaikh al-Albani advised Shaikh Hasan to go to al-Azhar University to continue his studies.<br /><br />Shaikh Hasan Rashid and Shaikh Muhsin al-Abbad both travelled to al-Azhar in 1970-71 and where the Shaikh completed the masters program in approximately 2 years. The Shaikh completed his master’s thesis on the chapters of Bukhari and All praise be to Allah, the sublime and exalted the Shaikh is unable to find it, it was probably misplaced during his travels. We pray that Allah facilitates its recovery. Amin<br /><br />In 1972-73 the Shaikh travelled back to Pakistan and taught in Jamia Salafiyyah Faisalabad for approximately 2 years until 1974-1975. Thereafter he was sent to Nigeria at the behest of Shaikh ʿAbd al-ʿAziz bin ʿAbd Allah ibn Baz where he spent over a decade teachings Ḥadīth and its sciences. He was then sent by Shaikh ʿAbd al-ʿAziz bin ʿAbd Allah ibn Baz to the United Kingdom in 1986 where he still continues to teach the Qurʾan and Hadith as well the other sacred sciences and has spent over 30 years teaching in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />In the late 80’ and early 90s’ he taught Riyadh al-Salihin in the old Mohammadi Masjid on Couchman road which I and Abu Hibban would often sit in. The Shaikh resides in Birmingham where he is still active and continues to teach on a daily basis in such a frail age. He taught Arabic and other subjects for many years in Green Lane Masjid and around Birmingham, he has taught and continues to teach books ranging from Aqidah, Hadith and Usul. Hafizahullah.<br /><br />This is a very brief biography and more will follow inshaAllah.<br /><br />Written by<br /><br />Abu Khuzaimah Imran Masoom Ansari<br /><br />Friday 21st October 2016</span></div>
