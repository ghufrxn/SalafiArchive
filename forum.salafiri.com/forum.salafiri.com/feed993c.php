<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">How Much Should I..?</span></strong><br /><br />It is reported that Wahb b. Munabbih – Allâh have mercy on him – said:<br /><br />A scholar once asked another greater than him in knowledge, “How much should I build?” He replied, “As much as shelters you from the sun and the rain.” He asked, “How much food should I eat?” He replied, “More than what keeps you hungry and less than what makes you full.” He asked, “How much should I wear?” He replied, “As the Messiah (Jesus) did.” He asked, “How much should I laugh?” He replied, “As much as appears on your face but does not make audible your voice.” He asked, “How much should I cry?” He replied, “Never tire from crying out of the fear of Allâh.” He asked, “How much should I hide my deeds?” He replied, “Until people think you had not done a good deed.” He asked, “How much should I make public my deeds?” He replied, “As much as will let the keen follow your example but not have the people talk about you.”<br /><br />Wahb said. “Everything has two ends and a middle. If you grab one end, the other will slant, but if you take the middle, both ends will balance. Stick to the balanced middle in all affairs.”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abû Nu’aym, Hilyatu Al-Awliyâ` 4:45</span></strong><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net">https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 1:53 pm</p><hr />
