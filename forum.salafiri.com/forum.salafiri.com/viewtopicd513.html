				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">They Recited, Ibn Baaz Explained and Then They Ate</span></strong><br /><br />Shaikh Khaalid ibn Abdur-Rahmaan ash-Shaayi’ said, “And I witnessed a Walimah the Shaikh had been invited to after ishaa. After he had taken his place he asked those present how they were and was introduced to them, he then said, ‘Who will read something from the Quraan to us?’ So it was as though everyone relied on the next person to read, and thus they gave no answer. So the Shaikh said, ‘Subhaanallaah! Why aren’t you desirous of the reward?’ So one of those there read something and after he finished reciting the Shaikh started to explain the excellence of reciting and then he explained the very verses that were recited. He then listened to some questions and answered them. After which he requested a second person to read, then a third, and he kept explaining the aayahs that were recited until the food was brought.”<br /><br />Mawaaqif Mudee’ah, p. 142.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://giftsofknowledge.net/2012/02/16/ibn-baaz-and-his-walking-stick-2/">http://giftsofknowledge.net/2012/02/16/ ... g-stick-2/</a><!-- m --></div>
