<strong>A compilation of the sayings of Ahmed Raza Khan.</strong><br /><br />The Imaam of the Barelwis, Ahmed Raza Khan said about himself:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />“No one asks about you, and no one cares for you, because the dogs like you are numerous, I am the dog” – Hadaa’iq bakhshish page 5 by Bareilawi<br /></div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />“Why should someone listen to you O Raza, dogs like you roam in thousands” - Hadaa’iq bakhshish page 11 by Bareilawi<br /></div></blockquote><br />The scholars of Ahlul Hadith, past and present have repeatedly advised the Barelwi and other Sufi sects that referring to themselves as ‘dogs’ is prohibited in Islam. Allah Azzawajal says <em>“We have certainly created man in the best of statute (95:4)”.</em> However, we find the Barelwis adamant and staunch on this position, determined to be label themselves as dogs to the extent where the modern-day leader of the sect Ilyas Qadri says about himself, I am from amongst the dogs of his dogs [referring to Abdul-Qadir Jilaani may Allah have mercy on him]. <br /><br /><strong>The black dog is a devil.</strong><br /><br />Abu Dharr reported:<br />The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: The black dog is a devil.<br /><em>Sahih Muslim 510 a</em><br /><br />Abu Zubair heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) saying:<br />Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill dogs, and we carried out this order so much so that we also kill the dog coming with a woman from the desert. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade their killing. He (the Prophet further) said: It is your duty the jet-black (dog) having two spots (on the eyes), for it is a devil.<br /><em>Sahih Muslim 1572</em><br /><br />When you ponder over these hadiths, you begin to wonder why did Shaykh Ehsan Elahi Zaheer (may Allah have mercy on him) bring up the skin tone of Ahmed Raza Khan in his lectures and book?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46571">AbuMuawiyahMirpuri</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2020 6:37 pm</p><hr />

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br /><br />The Barelwi-Sufis are notorious for their stance in regards to building upon the graves of the pious, of which include the prophets, saints and righteous. They virtually have no evidence to support their practice of building upon the graves. Islam has prohibited such an action and condemned it for reasons such as extravagance and a means to Shirk (polytheism). Islamic instructions are to level the grave to a handspan as is mentioned in the following hadith:<br /><br />It was narrated that Abul Hayaj al-Asadi said: Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me: “Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue/image without erasing it, and do not leave any raised grave without leveling it.”-Sahih Muslim, 969.<br /><br />Imam Nawawi names this chapter as: باب الأمر بتسوية القبر &quot;The chapter to level the grave&quot;.<br /><br />Now, the ignorant, ill-informed and foolish person may say &quot;But this is in regards to the graves of the Mushrikeen not the Muslimeen!&quot; In reply we say, read the narration before the previous one cited (hadith 968):<br /><br />Thumama bin Shufayy reported: &quot;When we were with Fadala bin Ubaid in the country of the romans at a place (known as) Rudis, a companion of ours died. Fadala bin Ubaid ordered to prepare a grave for him and then it was levelled; and then he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanding (us) to level the grave.&quot;- Sahih Muslim 968.<br /><br />The fact is that these hadith and the chapter heading + commentary of Imam Nawawi, do not mention or distinguish between the graves of the Mushrikeen or Muslimeen! So the flimsy argument of such an individual is flawed and rejected. <br /><br />Now, who do we follow? The Companions, or the Barelwis? Let us look at the following narration and take heed:<br /><br />:أَوْصَى أَبُو مُوسَى حِينَ حَضَرَهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَال<br /><br />إِذَا انْطَلَقْتُمْ بِجِنَازَتِي فَأَسْرِعُوا الْمَشْيَ، وَلَا يَتْبَعْنِي مِجْمَرٌ، وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا فِي لَحْدِي شَيْئًا يَحُولُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ التُّرَابِ، وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا عَلَى قَبْرِي بِنَاءً، وَأُشْهِدُكُمْ أَنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِنْ كُلِّ حَالِقَةٍ أَوْ سَالِقَةٍ أَوْ خَارِقَةٍ<br /><br />قَالُوا: أوسمعت فِيهِ شَيْئًا؟ <br /><br />قَال: نَعَمْ، مِنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ<br /><br />-مسند أحمد، أَوَّلُ مُسْنَدِ الْكُوفِيِّينَ، حَدِيثُ أَبِي مُوسَى الْأَشْعَرِيِّ: ١٩٥٤٧، إسناده حسن.<br /><br />Abu Musa al-Ashari (may Allah be pleased with him) gave orders on his deathbed saying:<br /><br />&quot;When you disperse with my body at my funeral procession, hasten, and let not a censer (incense burner) follow me, and do not place within my grave anything that seperates between me and the soil, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">and do not place upon my grave a construction</span></strong>, and I bear witness to you that I disassociate from every woman who shaves her head (due to a calamity), and every woman who raises her voice (due to a calamity) and every woman who rips her clothes (due to a calamity).&quot;<br /><br />Those present said: &quot;Did you hear anything in regards to these things?&quot;<br /><br />He said: &quot;Yes, from the <strong>messenger of Allah</strong> peace and blessings be upon him.&quot; <br /><br />-Musnad Ahmad, the first musnad of the kufiyeen, hadith of Abu Musa al-Ashari, 19547, its chain is hasan (authentic).<br /><br />Compare this to what the Barelwis do from building extravagant shrines and mausoleums! Is this the same understanding of Islam that was taught by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the Sahaba?! Clearly not.<br /><br />We ask Allah to grant them insight and guide them to the truth and keep us firm upon it, ameen. <br /><br />-Abu Abdillah Ehsan.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46547">AbuAbdillah</a> — Sun Jun 28, 2020 7:06 am</p><hr />

Introduction <br />The group known as the Bareilawis is known to many of us <br />especially those of us from the sub continent. Whether it is <br />family members or friends we know some people who ascribe to <br />this group and follow its teachings. So who are Bareilawis and <br />what do they believe? <br /><br />The Origin of the Word <br />The word Bareilawi comes from their founder whose name was <br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi born in Bareilly, a City in India <br />in the province of Uttar Pradesh. Hence, he named him self al- <br />Bareilawi (the Bareilawi) after the city he was born in. He was <br />born on 10 Shawwal 1272 which corresponds to 14 June 1865 CE. <br />Although the name given to him was Muhammad, he would refer to <br />himself in many of his works as Abdul Mustafa (Slave of al- <br />Mustafa - a name of the Prophet sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), <br />such a name obviously is not allowed. However, this was not his <br />only expression of shirk as you will find out in this article. <br /><br />Their History <br />Ahmad Rida founded the sect of the Bareilawis and it resides <br />mainly in the sub continent. This does not mean that similar <br />beliefs do not exist outside the sub continent though many of <br />those people would not have heard of the Bareilawis. The <br />beleifs and practices that Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi <br />brought, such as calling upon the dead, were not necessarily <br />new. People before him had practiced them, but he revived these <br />innovated beliefs with much vigour. The majority of Bareilawis <br />still reside in India and Pakistan though many are found <br />throughout the world such as in England where they have large <br />gatherings and sessions of weird and innovated practices. <br /><br />The Beliefs and Practices of the Barelawis The Bareilawis have <br />their own peculiar beliefs and doctrines, distinguished from <br />other factions of the Indian sub continent. Sometimes their <br />beliefs resemble the Shiah beliefs and doctrines, such as their <br />reverence and worship of saints and pious men. They have many <br />un-Islaamic beliefs, which are too numerous to mention here, we <br />will however highlight the most prominent of their beliefs. <br /><br />1. Seeking Help from Other Than Allaah <br /><br />The Bareilawis call upon other than Allaah in times of need, <br />this is clear in their books, <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said: <br /><br />&quot;There are servants of Allaah whom He has singled for <br />fulfilling the needs of the people who flee to them with their <br />needs.&quot; [Al Amn Wal Ula of Ahmad Rida al-Bareilawi p29] <br /><br />And he also said: <br /><br />&quot;Seeking help and aid from anyone besides Allaah is lawful and <br />desired. No one denies it except an arrogant and obstinate.&quot; <br />[Hayat al Mawat By Ahmad Rida al-Bareilawi; included in al <br />Fataawa ar-Ridwiyya (Pakistan Edition) Vol 4, p 300.] <br /><br />And he also says in Al Amn Wal Ula p10: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah is the remover of the calamity and <br />bestower of the donation.&quot; <br /><br />And he also says in Malfuzat p 99: <br /><br />&quot;Jibreel is the supplier of the needs, and the Messenger of <br />Allaah is the supplier of the needs, for the Prophet fulfils <br />the needs of Jibreel too.&quot; <br /><br />And he also said the following words of Kufr in Malfuzat p 307: <br /><br />&quot;During my life I did not seek help from anyone, and I do not <br />ask for aid except Shaykh Abdul Qaadir, whenever I seek help I <br />seek it only from him; whenever I ask for aid, I ask him alone. <br />Once I tried to ask for aid and seek help from another saint, <br />(hadhrat Mahbub Ilahi). When I intended to utter his name for <br />seeking help, I did not utter the words but 'Ya Ghauthan' (O <br />one whose help is sought). My tongue refused to utter the words <br />for seeking help from anyone except him.&quot; <br /><br />and Ahmad Rida Khaan also said in Al Amn wal Ula p44: <br /><br />&quot;When you are confused and helpless in matters, then seek help <br />from the inmates of the graves.&quot; <br /><br />All this is refuted by Islaam we say many times in our prayer: <br /><br />&quot;You alone do we worship and You alone do we ask for help.&quot; <br />[1:5] <br /><br />Allaah, the Exalted, said disapproving of the statements of the <br />polytheists and their acts, and reprimanding them: <br /><br />&quot;Say: (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) 'Call upon <br />those whom you assert (to be associate gods) besides Allaah, <br />they possess not even the weight of an atom (or a small ant), <br />either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share <br />in either, nor there is for Him any supporter from among <br />them.'&quot; [34:22] <br /><br />Allaah, the Glorified and Exalted, said: <br /><br />&quot;Such is Allaah your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom <br />you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer <br />(the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call <br />upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were <br />to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on <br />the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping <br />them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe <br />wa sallam) like Him Who is the All Knower (of each and <br />everything).&quot; [35:13-14] <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said to his cousin <br />Ibn Abbaas (radi-Allaahu 'anhumaa): <br /><br />&quot;When you ask, then ask Allaah, and when you seek help seek <br />help from Allaah.&quot; [Hasan Saheeh. Reported by At-Tirmidhee] <br /><br />2. Knowing the Unseen <br /><br />The Bareilawis believe that the Prophets, the Messengers of <br />Allaah and the righteous slaves and saints know the unseen: <br /><br />In ad-Dawlaat al-Makiyya p 58 of Ahmad Rida Khaan it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Prophets know, rather they see and watch over all that <br />which happened and all that which will happen from the first <br />day to the last.&quot; <br /><br />In the book of Ahmad Yaar, Mawa'iz Naimiya p 192 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Prophets know the unseen from their birth.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said in Khalis al Itiqaad p 38: <br /><br />&quot;The Knowldege of the guarded tablet, the knowledge of the pen, <br />and the knowledge of whatever existed and of whatever will <br />exist are part of the knowledge of the Prophet.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi also said in Mawa'iz Naimiyya p <br />364-365: <br /><br />&quot;If the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) places his foot <br />on an animal, it will have knowledge of the seen and the <br />unseen. How does a saint on whom the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) put his hand, not know the seen and <br />the unseen.&quot; <br /><br />All this kufr is again refuted by the Qur'aan and the Sunnah: <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'None in the <br />heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (unseen) except Allaah, <br />nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.' &quot; [27:65] <br /><br />&quot;And they say: 'How is it that not a sign is sent down on him <br />from his Lord?' Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam): 'The unseen belongs to Allaah Alone, so wait you, <br />verily I am with you among those who wait (for Allaah's <br />Judgement).' &quot; [10:20] <br /><br />The Messenger (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) once heard a <br />young girl say: <br /><br />&quot;Amongst us is a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow.&quot; <br /><br />So he (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said to her: <br /><br />&quot;Leave this and return to that which you were saying before.&quot; <br />[Bukhaaree] <br /><br />3. That the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is not <br />Human and was Created from Light <br /><br />It is written in Mawa'iz Naimiyya p14 by Ahmad Yaar (a leading <br />figure of the Bareilawis): <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah is light from the divine light, and <br />all the creatures are from his light.&quot; <br /><br />In al-Fatwaawa Naimiyya p 37 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;Allaah created the image of Muhammad from the light of his <br />names Al-Badee (The Originator), Al-Qaadir (The All Powerful), <br />and looked at it with his Name Al-Qaahir (The Irresistible). <br />Then He (Allaah) became manifest to him (the Prophet Sall <br />Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) with His names Al-Lateef (The <br />Subtle), Al-Ghaafir (The Most Gracious, The Most Forgiving)&quot; <br /><br />Islaam again rejects this belief, Allaah (subhaanahu wa <br />ta'alaa) mentions that what kept man from believing was the <br />fact that the Prophets and Messengers were human, as He <br />(subhaanahu wa ta'alaa) says: <br /><br />&quot;And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance <br />came to them, except that they said: 'Has Allaah sent a man as <br />(His) Messenger?' &quot; [17:94] <br /><br />Allaah then rejects this by saying: <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'If there were <br />on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We <br />should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an <br />angel as a Messenger.' &quot; [17:95] <br /><br />Allaah the Glorified and Exalted ordered His Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'I am only a <br />man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilaah (God) <br />is One Ilaah (God i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the <br />Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate <br />none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.' &quot; [18:110] <br /><br />The whole life of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />bears witness to him being a human, he ate, drank, relieved <br />himself, married, had children. And we say that he was the <br />greatest of mankind due to his status and rank as the Chief of <br />the Messengers. <br /><br />4. The Belief the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is <br />Ever Present and Ever Watchful (Haadhir wal Naazir) <br /><br />This is one of the main beliefs of the Bareilawis, this belief <br />is that the Prophet (Sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) is present <br />at every place and sees everything. This leads them to leave <br />spaces in their innovated gatherings believing that he (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) comes and sits in those gatherings. <br /><br />It is written in Taskin al-Khawatir fi Masalat al-Haadhir wal- <br />Naazir, that Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said: <br /><br />&quot;There is no place and there is no time in which the Messenger <br />of Allaah is not present.&quot; <br /><br />In Ja'al Haqq of Ahmad Yaar p 150 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah has power to travel throughout the <br />world with the spirits of the companions, and many saints have <br />seen him.&quot; <br /><br />In Khaalis al-Itiqaad p40 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Spirit of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is <br />present in the homes of the people of Islaam.&quot; <br /><br />This evil belief is totally refuted by Islaam, Allaah says <br />addressing His Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) whilst <br />mentioning the events of Moosaa (alayhis-salaam): <br /><br />&quot;And you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) were not on <br />the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Moosaa <br />(Moses) the commandment, and you were not among those present.&quot; <br />[28:44] <br /><br />He (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) also says: <br /><br />&quot;Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) Who took His slave <br />(Muhammad Sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) for a journey by night <br />from Al-Masjid-al-Haraam (at Makkah) to the farthest mosque (in <br />Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order <br />that We might show him (Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />of Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, <br />He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&quot; [17:1] <br /><br />This means that he, the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />would enter where he (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) was not <br />present at that time. <br /><br />Shaykh Hasan ibn Mansoor al-Ma`roof Biqaadeekhaan (d.592H) <br />writes, <br /><br />&quot;A man did nikaah with a woman without any witnesses and at the <br />time of the nikaah he said to the woman &quot;We make Allaah and his <br />Messenger our witnesses.&quot; The fuqahaa (Islaamic jurisprudents) <br />have said that this statement of the man is disbelief (kufr), <br />because he held the belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen <br />whereas he didn't have the knowledge of the unseen when he was <br />alive so how would he then have it after his death.&quot; [Fatawaa <br />Qaadee Khaan (p. 883)] <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Abdur-Rasheed Abul-Fattaah Zaheerud-Deen al- <br />Lululghee (d.540H) writes, <br /><br />&quot;A man without witnesses married a woman (and the witnesses <br />were not present). Addressing the woman he said &quot;I am doing <br />nikaah with you whilst making Allaah and his Messenger (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) my witnesses,&quot; then that individual <br />will become a kaafir (disbeliever), because he came to the <br />belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) has the knowledge of the unseen, because the one who <br />doesn't have knowledge then how can he become a witness. The <br />person who has this aqeedah that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen and <br />he is present and with us then he is a kaafir.&quot; [Fataawaa Walu <br />al-Jeeyah wa Kadha Beeree Haashiyah Ishbah] <br /><br />Shaykh Aboo Haneefah at-Thasnee Zaynul-Aabideen Ibn Najeem al- <br />Misree (d.970H) says, <br /><br />&quot;If anyone takes Allaah and Muhammad (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) as witnesses for nikaah then from the start, that <br />person will become a kaafir because he held the belief that the <br />Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) knows the <br />knowledge of the unseen.&quot; [Bahrur-Raqiaq (5/16)] <br /><br />Sultaan Aalamgeer (d.1118), the Islamic Constitution, Law and <br />Principles which he set out in India with the help of five <br />hundred fuqahaa. In it, it has the explanation, &quot;That a man did <br />nikaah without any witnesses and he said &quot;I make Allaah and his <br />Messenger (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) my witnesses,&quot; or he <br />says &quot;I make Allaah's Messenger my witness,&quot; or he says &quot;I make <br />Allaah and his Angels my witnesses.&quot; then such an individual <br />will become a kaafir. If he says I make the Angels on my right <br />and left sides (kiraaman-kaatibeen) as my witnesses then he <br />will not be a kaafir (Because both these Angels are present <br />with us but the nikaah (marriage) will be invalid.&quot; [Fataawaa <br />Alamgeer (2/412)] <br /><br />In the famous and well-known Hanafee Fiqh book Fataawaa <br />Tataarkhaniyyah it is written, <br /><br />&quot;The one who makes Allaah and his Messenger (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) as witnesses for nikaah, then his <br />nikaah will be invalid and the individual will become a kaafir <br />because he held the belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen.&quot; <br /><br />It is written in the well-known Fataawaa Jawahir Ikhlaaqiyyah, <br /><br />&quot;That if someone understood that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen then <br />he becomes a kaafir and if this ’aqeedah is held about <br />someone else, then how can the individual remain a Muslim?&quot; <br /><br />Imaam Abee Ibn Abee Bakr (d.593H), the author of Hidaayah in <br />his book Tajnees (p. 297). <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Taahir Ibn Ahmad (d.542H) in Khulaasatul-Fataawaa <br />(4/354). <br /><br />Imaam Abdur-Rahmaan (d.561H) in Fusool Eemadiyyah (p. 64). <br /><br />Imaam Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Khawarzamee al-Mashoor Bil-Bazaazee <br />(d.827H) in Fataawaa Bazzaziyyah (p. 325). <br /><br />Al-Muhaddith al-Allaamah Badrud Deen al-Aynee (d.855H) in <br />Umdatul-Qaaree (11/520). <br /><br />Al-Haafidh Ibnul-Hammaam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Waahid (d.861H) in <br />Masaayarah M'a al-Masamarah (2/88) printed in Egypt. <br /><br />Al-Muhaddith Alee Ibn Sultaan, commonly known as Mullaa Alee <br />Qaaree (d.1014H) in Sharh Fiqhul-Akbar (p. 185). <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Ibn Aabideen al-Hanafee (d.970H) in Shaamee (2/306). <br /><br />Thanaa ullaah Pani Patee (d.1225H) in Maalaa ba'd Mun (p.176) <br />and other Hanafee Fuqahaa have clarified that, The individual <br />who holds the aqeedah that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the <br />unseen or he was present with us then he commits an act of <br />disbelief (kufr). <br /><br /><br /><br />5. Evil Practices at the Grave <br /><br />The Bareilawis have many evil practices at the graves such as <br />prostration to it or near it, making tawaaf of the graves, and <br />putting candles and lamps on the graves, raising them high. <br /><br />It is written in Ja'al Haqq p 300 of Ahmad Yaar: <br /><br />&quot;To light the lamps and candles at the graves of the saints, <br />righteous people and the learned is to exalt the saints. The <br />purpose lying behind it is a good one. The offering of oil and <br />candle to the saints kindled at their graves for their <br />exaltation and out of their love is lawful. It is not proper to <br />prohibit them from this practice.&quot; <br /><br />It is mentioned in a hadeeth reported by Muslim that: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />prohibited the plastering of graves, sitting upon them and <br />building over them.&quot; <br /><br />In the book called Bahari Shariat it is written: <br /><br />&quot;There is no harm if a person circumambulates (makes tawaaf) <br />around the grave to attain blessings.&quot; <br /><br />Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) clearly states in the Qur'aan <br />that we can only make tawaaf of the Ka'bah: <br /><br />&quot;And make Tawaaf around the Ancient House.&quot; [22:29] <br /><br />6. The Celebration of Birth and Death Anniversaries <br /><br />The Bareilawis celebrate the anniversaries of the death of <br />saints and righteous men. These are held at their graves. <br /><br />One of the disciples of Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi wrote in the <br />book Bahari Shariat (Vol 1): <br /><br />&quot;The celebration of the death anniversary of the saints, <br />recitation of the Qur'aan, al-Faatihah, preaching, and shifting <br />reward to them are the cause of blessings, for the saints are <br />alive in their graves, and the faculties of their knowledge, <br />perception, hearing and seeing have increased.&quot; <br /><br />One of their scholars issued a fatwa: <br /><br />&quot;The Prayer is lawful only behind a person who celebrates the <br />death anniversaries and recites al-Faatihah. As regards those <br />who are opposed to these things, prayer behind them is not <br />lawful.&quot; [Al-Haqq Al-Mubin p74 by Al-Kazimi] <br /><br />They also celebrate the birthday of the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), which is an innovation and was <br />never practiced by him (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) or by <br />any of his Companions. They decorate their gatherings and <br />houses and believe that only those who celebrate this day will <br />attain salvation. <br /><br />In Ja'al Haqq of Ahmad Yaar it says: <br /><br />&quot;To celebrate a festival, to hold gatherings, to rejoice and to <br />distribute sweets on the anniversary of the Prophet's birthday <br />are commendable and the cause of the coming down of the <br />Blessings and Mercy of Allaah. The Christians celebrate <br />festivals on Sunday, the day when a table of food came down to <br />them from Heaven. Why should we not celebrate on the day, which <br />is more excellent than that?&quot; <br /><br />The religion of Allaah (subhaanah wa ta'aala) was completed in <br />the lifetime of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) as <br />He (subhaanah wa ta'aala) says: <br /><br />&quot;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My <br />Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your <br />religion.&quot; [5:3] <br /><br />There was no celebration of any birthdays or death <br />anniversaries during the time of the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam). Islaam rejects all of these <br />celebrations. <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said: <br /><br />&quot;Whoever innovates in this affair of ours something which does <br />not belong in it will have it rejected&quot; [Bukhaaree and Muslim] <br /><br />If the celebration of the Prophet's (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) birthday had been something good then definitely the <br />Companions, those who loved him (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />the most, would have done it and told others to do it. However, <br />this is not the case, so we have no right to do what they did <br />not do. <br /><br />7. The Evil Belief Allaah is Everywhere <br /><br />Like other Sufi sects, the Bareilawis believe that Allaah is <br />everywhere in His Essence, as we explained in the last <br />newsletter this belief is false and goes against the teaching <br />of Islaam. <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said in the famous <br />hadeeth of the slave girl: <br /><br />&quot;Where is Allaah?&quot; She replied, &quot;Above the Heavens.&quot; He sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam said, &quot;And who am I?&quot; She <br />replied, &quot;You are the Messenger of Allaah.&quot; He sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam said, &quot;Free her for verily she is a <br />believer.&quot; [Saheeh Muslim] <br /><br />8. Bareilawis and their Takfeer of the Muslims who Oppose them <br /><br />The Bareilawis are very stubborn in their beliefs, whenever <br />someone opposes what they do and shows its falsehood and how it <br />is Shirk they immediately label them as 'Wahaabi' apostates. <br />This reference to wahaabi is a twisting of one of the <br />attributes of Allaah Al-Wahaab (The All Giver) and hence is not <br />permissible. They call Muslims who oppose them this after the <br />great Scholar Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahaab who <br />fought against their beliefs and called to Tawheed (worshipping <br />Allaah alone).The Bareilawis call themselves 'Sunnis' or Ahlus- <br />Sunnah wal-Jammaah and they are far from that, for they do not <br />follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) nor do they adhere to the people of truth. <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said in Ahkaam ash-Sharih Vol 1 <br />p123-124: <br /><br />&quot;The Most wicked of the apostates are the Wahaabis.&quot; and, <br /><br />&quot;The Wahaabis are more wicked, harmful and impure than the Jews <br />and the Christians.&quot; <br /><br />Rida Khaan said: &quot;If anyone admires Darul Ulum Deoband, or does <br />not believe in the corruption of the Deobandi's and does not <br />scorn them, then this is sufficient to make a judgment for him <br />to be a Non-Muslim!&quot; (Fatawa Ridwiyya, 6/43 of Rida Khaan). <br /><br />Rida Khaan in his Malfuzat (pp. 325-6) said: &quot; If there is a <br />gathering of Hindus, Christians, Qadiyanis and Deobandis, then <br />Deobandis alone should be rejected, for they have come out of <br />the fold of Islam and defected from it. Agreement with the <br />unbelievers is far better than the agreement with the <br />apostates!&quot; <br /><br /><br />&quot;The works of the Deobandis are more unclean than the various <br />works of the Hindus. The doubt about the heresy of Ashraf Ali <br />Deobandi and suspicion about the punishment is also unbelief. <br />To cleanse the impurity with the papers of the works produced <br />by the Deobandis is not lawful, not because of the respect for <br />their books, but because of the reverance of the letters with <br />which they have been written.&quot; (Fatawa Ridwiyya, 2/136, <br />Faisalabad, Pakistan). <br /><br /><br />9. Deviated Ascription of Power to the Prophets and Saints <br /><br />The Bareilawis allege that the Power of Allaah, His Sovereignty <br />and His Authority has shifted to the Prophets and Saints. <br /><br />The son of Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi says in al-Istimdad <br />ala ajyal al-Irtidad p 32-33: <br /><br />&quot;Whatever appears in the universe, our chief Muhammad grants <br />it, in whose hands lie all the keys. Therefore, nothing goes <br />out from the divine treasures but at his hands. Whenever he <br />intends to do an act, nothing occurs against it and nothing in <br />the universe can hinder it.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi says in al-Istimdad ala ajyal al- <br />Irtidad p 32-33: <br /><br />&quot;It is the Messenger of Allaah who heals up the diseases and <br />pains, removes every calamity from the Muslims, he gives life <br />and resolves the dilemmas, benefits all the creatures, and <br />raises their degrees. He is the guardian, the helper, and the <br />remover of adversity. It is he who cooled down the fire of <br />Ibraaheem. It is he who donates and bestows, and his command is <br />in force and his order is operative in the universe.&quot; <br /><br />What Shirk and Kufr this is! Glory be to Allaah who is far <br />removed from having any equal, the Lord of the Heavens and the <br />Universe, Who said: <br /><br />&quot;And so many a moving (living) creature there is, that carries <br />not its own provision! Allaah provides for it and for you. And <br />He is the All-Hearer, the All­Knower.&quot; [29:60] <br /><br />&quot;Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to <br />do all things.&quot; [62:1] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'In Whose Hand <br />is the sovereignty of everything (i.e. treasures of each and <br />everything)? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is <br />no protector, if you know.' &quot; [23:88] <br /><br />&quot;And no (moving) living creature is there on earth but its <br />provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place <br />and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.) all is in a Clear <br />Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfooz - the Book of Decrees with Allaah).&quot; <br />[11:6] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'Verily, my <br />Lord enlarges and restricts the provision to whom He pleases, <br />but most men know not.' &quot; [34:36] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'O Allaah <br />Possessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You <br />will, and You take the kingdom from whom You will, and You <br />endue with honour whom You will, and You humiliate whom You <br />will. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all <br />things.' &quot; [3:26] <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said: <br /><br />&quot;Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians exaggerated <br />in praising the son of Maryam (Eesaa alayhis-salaam), for <br />verily, I am only a slave, so say the slave of Allaah and His <br />Messenger.&quot; [Bukhaaree] <br /><br />Misconceptions Cleared <br />Some people might say this is only the belief of the leaders of <br />the Bareilawis and not the beleifs of the followers today. This <br />is false, as is witnessed by anyone who has visited Pakistan, <br />India or Kashmir. They will have witnessed the Shirk that goes <br />on at the graves and the belief these people still hold. They <br />love and revere Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi, take from his <br />books and refer to him, indeed they still adhere to his beleifs <br />and practices. <br /><br />Some people might say that you are making takfeer (declaring as <br />non-Muslims) all the Bareilawis. This is not true. We can not <br />say that every single Bareilawi is a Kaafir. Rather we say that <br />these beliefs of theirs are clear Kufr. Whoever adopts these <br />beliefs of kufr, after the proof has been correctly established <br />upon them, then they fall into disbelief. The people of <br />Knowledge can then give a ruling concerning individuals. <br /><br />Conclusion <br />So we have looked at some of the false and wicked beliefs of <br />these people. Their beliefs are closely linked with the Shiah <br />and it is difficult to know who copied whom in their beliefs. <br />Any Muslim who is reading this will realise that these people <br />must be warned against, so we give the following advice: <br /><br />1. To Bareilawis: Leave your innovated beliefs and practices <br />which have no foundation in Islaam and come to that which will <br />give you life, the Qur'aan and Sunnah as understood by the <br />Companions. Accept the truth before death overcomes you. Put <br />your emotions to one side and analyse your beliefs in light of <br />the evidences from authentic sources. <br /><br />2. To the people of 'unity at all costs' who find no problem co- <br />operating with Sufis like the Bareilawis: We advice you to <br />return to the way of the Companions in dealing with people who <br />transgress the limits laid down by Allaah. You claim to be upon <br />the truth yet you do not defend it. You claim to love the truth <br />yet you do not defend its people. You claim to be sincere yet <br />you do not search for the truth. You claim to take from the <br />scholars yet you do not sit with them. You claim to be <br />followers of the Salaf us-Saalih (righteous predecessors) yet <br />you do not pay heed to their advice. <br /><br />We ask Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta'alaa) to guide us all to the <br />truth and to expose the people of falsehood wherever they are. <br />Ameen<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2024">Abu Shaqran Zahiri</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 12:00 am</p><hr />

By now the avid readers is well acquainted with the oft repeated and reverberating delusional echo of where are the ijazat of Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1420H) and the fallacious allegation that he had no teachers etc etc and other such allegations are never ending from the sufi Deobandi Barelwi Ash'ari quarters. Despite numerous detailed answers one can only but present the truth and facts without coercing the academic minds from amongst them to accept the truth.<br /><br />so we thought perhaps a different and interactive approach could be utilised. Two common allegations levied against Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani are<br /><br />i) he only learnt from his father who was of hanafi jurisprudence<br />ii) he was self taught, no teachers, no scholarship, etc. <br /><br />but<br /><br />how about the following, and we attach the video for the benefit of those who understand urdu (we had to trawl through many many videos to find this). It is absolutely staggering to see the Barelwi's and the Barelwi sufi sympathisers hurl such allegations against Shaikh al-Albani when their own Ahmad Raza Khan 'Ala Hazrat' is in actual fact worthy of the same allegations (as per their own house members). Please do not be confused that this does not mean the allegations levied sheikh sheikh al-Albani are in anyway for or shape true, because they have been answered many times.<br /><br />here is a gist of what the speaker (Pir Syed Muzaffar Shah Sahab) says<br /><br /><center> <strong>iframe</strong> </center><br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan learnt all of his knowledge from his father Naqi Ali Khan, as Ahmad Raza Khan himself testifies and mentions, i.e. as per the speaker, Ahmad Raza Khan learnt ALL of his knowledge from his Father (time stamp (18seconds+)<br /><br />He goes onto say we were talking about knowledge that was given and self achieved, therefore Ahmad Raza Khan learnt 21 sciences and disciplines from his father and that <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;ALLAH GAVE HIM KNOWLEDGE OF A FURTHER 34 SCIENCES AND DISCIPLINES&quot;</span></strong><br /><br />....and wait for it, he further says, <br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>&quot;WITHOUT A TEACHER....AND SELF TAUGHT&quot;</strong></span><br /><br />(time stamp 18seconds - 1:12)<br /><br />and if this was not bad, he goes onto to say, there was a contentious issue pertaining to currency and there were 12 questions and Ahmad Raza Khan answered a fatwa in one and half day to such difficult questions that numerous scholars could not even formulate points. One of the scholars of Makkah (Ismail Makki) at the time said<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong> IF ABU HANIFAH HAD SEEN THIS FATWA HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN AHMAD RAZA KHAN AS HIS STUDENT </strong></span> (time stamp 3:05+)<br /><br />this is the extreme veneration of Ahmad Raza Khan amongst the Sufi Barelwis that they put Ahmad Raza Khan on par with the other students of Abu Hanifah, the likes of Muhammad Shaybani, Abu yusuf, Zuffar etc. Im sure the deobandi's might something to say about this, just as they ran to the defence of their sufi Barelwi brother after the debate they were subdued!!!<br /><br />he goes onto mention other such exaggerative statements....<br /><br />So we ask Ahmad Raza Khan was self taught and only leant from his teacher and as per this vide he learns only from his father.....i wonder what the Barelwis will say about their Muddied  e Millat and Ala Hazrat...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2017 11:47 pm</p><hr />

translating the book ‘The (Aqidah of the) Bareilwis and Deobandis Are The Same’ of Shaikh Talib ur Rehman, we thought it would be beneficial to publish it as two separate treatises, with the aim to highlight the beliefs of these two sects separately for the new reader who may want to know the basics of their beliefs.<br /><br />This is an E-Book publication, it can downloaded in PDF format or alternatively read online.<br /><br />Sha’ban 1436H / June 2015ce<br /><br />Salafi Research Institute 2015<br /><br />[1]<br /><br />The Aqeedah of Wahdatul Wajood (ie Allaah is incarnate in everything) that Allaah Came To This Earth as Muhammad (r)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “lift the veils and show us your might, as the Noor of Allaah is veiled” (Hadaaiq Bakhshish 1/80)<br />Muhammad Yaar Gharhee wrote, “The one who used blow the flute all the time and say I am the slave, will come out on Gods throne and say ana inallaah (for I am Allaah) (Deewaan Muhammadi pg.149)<br /><br />Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed wrote, “Ahmad (a name of the Messenger of ­Allaah) (r) to Ahad (ie the one Allaah) there is no difference as there is no ­attribute of oneness.” (Kaafee no.99 pg.90)<br /><br /> <br />[2]<br /><br />The Attributes Of Allaah Are Exclusive For Him And Even Messenger of Allaah (r) Cannot Have Them.<br /><br />The Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “The enlightened one and the leader of the Helpers (ie Abdul Qaadir Jeelaanee) is the complete inheritor, representative and a reflection of the essence of the Messenger of Allaah (r) in terms of all of his ­attributes, his grandeur, his might and his virtues, in the same ­manner Allaah is with all of his attributes and might that he reflected himself in ­Muhammad (r)” (Fatwaa Ifreeqiyyah pg.101)<br /><br />[3]<br /><br />Mankind Can Only Claim to be the Worshipper of Allaah and Nothing Else As This Is Shirk.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan named himself as Abdul Mustafa (ie the worshipping slave of the Messenger Of Allaah (r) (Man Huwa Ahmad Raza pg.16 of Shujaat ­Qadiree)<br /><br /> <br />[4]<br /><br />Only Allaah Alone Can Help And No Prophet Or Holy Person Can Help.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Seeking help and assistance from the prophets, Auliyaa and righteous scholars is permissible even after their deaths as the Auliyaa even after their deaths, have power and rights to help in this world.” (Risaalah Hayaatal-Mawaat of Ahmad Raza Khan, from Fataawa Ridhwiyyah 4/300)<br />Another Bareilwee scholar said, “The power and rights to help of the Auliyaa increase after their deaths” (Fataawa Naeemiyyah pg.249)<br /><br /> <br />[5]<br /><br />Only Allaah Can Help With Calamities And He Alone Is The One Who Is Asked For Help.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ayoob Ridhwi writes about Ahmad Raza Khan,<br /><br />“The remover of the  problems of the creation Ahmad Raza,<br /><br />He is my helper of calamities Ahmad Raza<br /><br />Who gives to me and who gave what<br /><br />Whatever was given you gave Ahmad Raza<br /><br />in both abodes it is your protection<br /><br />Yes help us leader Ahmad Raza<br /><br />When there is the longing on the day of reckoning<br /><br />Hide us in your protection Ahmad Raza<br /><br />When the tongues dry out from thirst<br /><br />Gives us water from the pool of al-Kauthar Ahmad Raza<br /><br />Help us in the grave, when we are called and on hashr<br /><br />Be the one who removes my calamities Ahmad Raza<br /><br />you are the Giver and I am the asker of you<br /><br />I am yours and you are mine Ahmad Raza<br /><br />(Noor Muhammad A’zmaa pg.47-48)<br /><br /> <br />[6]<br /><br />Only Allaah Alone can Remove Calamities<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “There are certain people of Allaah whom he has singled out for the removal of calamities and the people whilst being worried and fearful go to them for help for the removal of their calamities.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.29)<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan further writes, “And the respected (Messenger of Allaah (r) is there for help at difficult times and he is the one who gives the best help so call upon him humbily and he is the one to seek refuge in from every evil.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.10)<br /><br /> <br />[7]<br /><br />Only Allaah Is the One Who We Plea To And He Is The Helper (ie Gauth)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Deedar Alee Bareilwee writes, “There is a Gauth (helper) in every era and without him the Heavens and Earths cannot exist” (Rasool al-Kalaam pg.129)<br />In one place Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Because the Auliya are so wide spread, the system of the world is intact.” (al-Aman Wal Ula pg.34)<br /><br /> <br />[8]<br /><br />Believing Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge Of The Unseen<br /><br />Bareilweee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “Once Shaikh Muhiy ud deen Ibn A’rabee went to an invitation and he saw a young boy who was eating and all of a sudden he starting crying and when he was asked why he was crying he said, “My mother has been ordained to go to Hell and the Angels are taking her right now.” Shaikh Muhiy ud deen had already recited the kalimah 70,000 times and so he transferred the reward of the deed to the boys mother. All of a sudden the boy started laughing so Shaikh Muhiy ud deen asked him why he was laughing and he replied, “I saw the Angels taking my mother to Paradise.” (Malfoozaat Ahmad Raza Khan pg.82, see also Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pg.48)<br /><br /> <br />[9]<br /><br />The People of This World Call Upon Those Who Are Dead, Who Do Not Have The Ability to Speak, Listen, Smell, Hold or To See in This World.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khaan writes, “Once hadhrat Sayyidee Ismaa’eel Hadhramee walked through a graveyard and Imaam Muhib ud deen Tabaree was with him. Hadhrat Sayyidee Ismaa’eel said, “Do you believe you can speak to the dead.” He replied, “yes” (Malfoozaat pgs.200-201 of Ahmad Raza, Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pgs.57-58)<br /><br /> <br />[10]<br /><br />The Coming and Goings of Souls Is A Mere Fallacy of These Mullahs And A Means of Filling Their Hell Bent Stomachs In Which The Deobandee are Similar to the Bareilwees<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />According to the Bareilwees the souls of the believers return to their houses on Thursday’s and whilst remaining near the doors call in a sorrowful voice, “Oh my household , oh my children, oh my close ones, have mercy upon us with sadaqah. Hence the soul of the deceased comes to the house on Friday night and sees whether sadaqah has been given on their behalf or not.” (Risaalah Ityaan al-Arwah in Majmoo’a Rasaa’il 2/69)<br /><br />[11]<br /><br />The Elder Holy Saints Control this World<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar writes, “2 auliya used to live on opposite sides of a river. One day one of them made rice pudding and told his servant to give it to his friend, the servant said “There is a river in the way, how will I get across as I don’t have a boat?” The auliya replied, “Go to the river and say, “I have been sent on the order of the one who has never slept with his wife.” The servant was shocked and thought how is that possible, as the auliya had children. None the less I went, as fulfilling the order was necessary. So I said to the river what I was told to say and all of a sudden the river gave me way.” When he reached the other side he gave the rice pudding to the auliya, who ate it and said, “Convey my greetings to your master.” So the servant said, “i’ll only be able to do that once I get across the river.” The auliya replied, “Go and say to the river, “I have been sent on the order by him who has never eaten in 30 years.” The servant was extremely shocked as the auliya had just eaten in front of him. Yet again with regards to respecting him he remained quiet and ventured to the river said what he was told and the river once again gave him way.” (Hakayaat Ridhwiyyah pg.53)<br /><br />[12]<br /><br />Other Than Allaah Have The Knowledge of The Unseen<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza writes, “The Messenger of Allaah (r) had knowledge of the 5 keys but he was ordered to conceal this from the people.” (Khaalis Ei’tiqaad pg.56)<br /><br />[13]<br /><br />The Scholars Know the Time of Death of The People And Knowledge of This Earth.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan writes, “One day Shaikh Makaarim said, “In the near future 3 people will come here and they will die. He said such and such will die like this and such and such will die like this. After a short while the 3 individuals came and as it happened they died in the same manner that was foretold.” (ad-Daulatul-Makiyyah pg.164)<br /><br />[14]<br /><br />The Scholars Of The Bareilwees and Deobandees Know What Is In The Wombs<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khaan writes, “We have seen groups of people who have found out how we will die. They have also managed to find out what is in a pregnant mothers womb, whether it is a girl or a boy. So now tell us, have we not found out the meaning of this verse or is there still some ambiguity.” (Khaalis Ei’tiqaad pg.53, al-Kalimatul-A’liyah pg.35 of Muradabadee)<br /><br />Another Bareilwee scholar writes, “I have heard from some auliya they can inform people of what is in the wombs whether it is a boy or a girl. I have seen with my own eyes that whatever they predicted, is what happened.” (Kalimatul-A’liyah pg.94-95)<br /><br />[15]<br /><br />Do You Really Get Blessings From Dead People And Those In The Graves.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar by the name of Uthmaan writes, “You can receive blessings by visiting graves and you can also receive help from pious dead people.” (Kashf Fuyoodh)<br /><br />He writes further in another place, “By visiting graves the intent is to receive blessings from the people who are in the graves.” (Kashf Fuyoodh pg.43)<br /><br />[16]<br /><br />The Prophet (r) Lived a Worldly Life In His Grave<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “The living of the Prophets (in their graves) is real, sensuous and like a worldly living.” (Malfoozaat 3/276)<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “The Prophets, eat, drink and pray in their graves.” (Malfoozaat 3/276)<br /><br />A Bareilwee scholar, Deedaar Alee wrote. “For 3 consecutive days the Adhaan for the 5 prayers could be heard from the Prophets (r) grave.” (Hidaayatut-Tareeq Fee Bayaan ut-Tahqeeq pg.86)<br /><br />The author of Hayaat un-Nabee wrote, “When the Funeral of Abu Bakr  (t)  was placed near the grave of the Prophet (r) a sound was heard, “Bring or enter the friend to his friend.” (Hayaat un-Nabee pg.125)<br /><br />[17]<br /><br />There is no Harm in Reciting a Different Kalimah to our Kalimah, Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhammadur Rasoolullah.<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Shaah Gul Hasan Qaadiree writes, “One day Ghauth Alee Shaah Qalandar Qaadiree said, “Two people came to Abu Bakr Shiblee wanting to give him the pledge of allegiance.[1] So he said to one of them “say, Laa ilaaha Illalaahu Shiblee Rasoolullaah. The man replied, “(La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah, (There is no power or strength except with Allaah). So Shiblee said the same back. The man asked, “Why did you say La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah.” Shiblee asked you tell me first why did you say La Hawla Wa Laa Quawata Illaah Billaah. The man said because I came to give my pledge of allegiance to someone who is negligent of the Sharee’ah. Shiblee replied well I said it because I revealed my secret to an ignorant person like you.” The second man was told to recite Laa ilaaha Illalaahu Shiblee Rasoolullaah he replied I thought you were something else ie good and pious but your even worse and attacking the prophecy. Shiblee laughed and replied, “I was trying to educate you as everyone’s understanding and morale is different whereas in reality my point is the same as yours so in your heart there was rejection and it never entered your heart and in my heart the morale was even more higher. Shiblee did not mean what was apparent. The point was that the person who educates and guides others then for the student he is the Messenger and the one who fulfils the work of prophecy ordained by Allaah.” (Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah pg.323, Printed by Fareed Book Stall Lahore.)<br /><br />The author of Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah writes, “Muhkam ud deen was a complete worshipper and so once we went to his house and he had very good manners. So we asked his name and he replied Allaah. We said, Subhanallah we have been looking for you in the heavens when in reality you are here. He then asked us our name but we replied, “How can you be Allaah when you don’t even know our names?” He paused for a minute and pondered and then said, “You are Gauth Alee and your father is Ahmad Hasan and your grandfather is Zahoor al-Hasan. Then we said to him now we know you are Allaah. Then a man came to give him his pledge of allegiance and he was told to say Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Muhkam ud deen Rasoolullaah. We then said to him “You must stop and just be Allaah as you cannot pull off being the one from Madeenah and many people before you claimed to be Gods (ie Allaah) like fir’aun, namrood, shadaad and others.” Khawaja Ghulaam Fareed said, “Once a man came to Khawaja Muhiy ud deen Chistee and said to him, “I want to be your disciple, he replied say, “Laa Ilaaha Illalaahu Chistee Rasoolullaah…” (Tadhkirrah Ghauthiyyah pg.110 Fawaa’id Fareediyyah pg.83, printed by Maktabah Ma’een al-Adaab from Dhera Ghazee Khaan)<br /><br />[18]<br /><br />The Prophet Was Created From Noor<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan mentions a self formulated narration, “The Messenger of Allaah (r) said to Jaabir (t), Without doubt and with certainty Allaah created the noor of your Prophet from his own noor before he created any of the creation. Then that noor remained in oblivion and at that time, the Lauh (the tablet) the Pen, Paradise, Hell, Angels, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Jinn and mankind were not created. When Allaah wished to create the creation he divided that noor into 4 parts. He created the Pen with the first, the Lauh with the second, the Arsh with the third and divided the 4th part into further 4 parts.” (Risaalah Salah as-Safaa pg.23)<br /><br />A bareilwee scholar Ahmad Yaar wrote, “The Messenger (r) was created from the Noor of Allaah and all of the creation was created with the Messengers Noor.” (Muwaa’iz Na’aeemiyyah pg.14)<br /><br />[19]<br /><br />Shirk in the Characteristics Of the Prophet (r)<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Ahmad Raza Khan wrote, “Headache and fever are those gifted illnesses that the Prophets used to suffer with. (he further goes onto say) Alhamdulillah I also suffer from regular headaches.” (Malfoozaat 1/64)<br /><br />[20]<br /><br />Who is Infallible<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Abdul Hakeem Qaadiree writes, “A’la hazrats (ie Ahmad Raza Khan) pen and tongue were preserved from mistakes and although scholars sometimes do make some mistake however A’la hazrat did not even make a mistake of a single dot.” (Yaad A’la Hazrat of Abdul Hakeem Ashraf Qadiree pg.32, ‘Rememberance Of A’la Haazrat’ (ie Ahmad Raza Khan))<br />Another bareilwee boldly said in Anwaar Raza, “Allaah had purified (ie Ahmad Razas) his pen and tongue from any mistakes.” (Anwaar Raza pg.271)<br /><br />The author further said, “Ahmad Raza was pure from mistakes from his childhood and following the straight path was instilled into him.” (Anwaar Raza pg.223)<br /><br /> <br />[21]<br /><br />Is The Word Of Someone Other Than The Prophets Evidence<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />A follower of Ahmad Raza Khan attributed prophethood to him in the following way, “A’la Hazrat (ie Ahmad Raza) was Allaah’s evidence and proof on this earth.”  (Anwaar Raza pg.33)<br /><br /> <br />[22]<br /><br />Who Is The One Who is Really Disrespectful (Gustaakh) To The Prophet<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />Bastawee writes, “After the death of Ahmad Raza an Arab man came and said, “On the 25th of Safar in the year 1340H my destiny changed and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (r) in a dream. The Messenger of Allaah (r) has come and his companions are also waiting with him but there is a silence in the gathering and from the indicators I find out that they are waiting for someone. So I said to the Prophet (r), “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, who are you waiting for? He (the Prophet (r) replied, “Ahmad Raza.” I asked, “Who is Ahmad Raza.” The Prophet (r) replied, “A resident of bareilee in India.” After my dream I longed to meet Ahmad Raza so I went to India, Bareilee and found that Ahmad Raza was dead. It was the very same day of the 25th when I travelled and it was also the day of his death.” (Bastawee pg.121, Fataawa Ridhwiyyah vol 2 Muqaddimah pg.13)<br /><br /> <br />[23]<br /><br />Who Disrespects The Companions<br /><br />Bareilwee Aqeedah<br /><br />The one who disrespected the companions by saying the following about Ahmad Raza Khaan, “Seeing A’la hazrat decreased my yearning to see the companions.” (Wasayaa Shareef pg.24)<br /><br />[1] [TN] This Pledge of Allegiance is the pledge a new soofee mureed ie disciple gives to a soofee teacher thereby submitting his will to the teacher. The soofee teacher also commonly known as a Peer, guides and tells the soofee mureed what to do from every aspect of his life from the extent of what to wear, marriage, relations with his wife and so on.<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-the-barailwis-shaikh-talib-ur-rehman/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-aqidah-of-t ... ur-rehman/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">SRI</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:16 am</p><hr />
