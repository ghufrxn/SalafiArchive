Is he a disbeliever?<br /> <br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">We bear witness that Al-Hajjaj was an evildoer, an oppressor.</span></strong> However, we do not know from him that he rejected any of those aspects from the Religion, which one is required to know by necessity.<br /><br />Therefore, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">it is not permissible to declare him a disbeliever</span></strong> just on the basis that he used to commit evil, oppress others and kill innocent Muslims.<br /><br /><em>[Al-Asaalah, Issue #1]</em></div>
