				<div class="content">The word Tawheed found in ahadeeth, here is one example:<br /><br />The Messenger - sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam - said to some women:<br /><br />(‘You should make Tasbeeh, Tahleel Taqdees and do not be negligent and forget Tawheed (and in a narration: mercy), and count them on your fingertips since they will be questioned and will respond.’ <br /><br />[This hadeeth is Hasan, narrated by Abu Dawood and other than him, Hakim and Dhahabi authenticated it and an-Nawawi and al-Asqalani graded it as Hasan as is mentioned in ‘Amali al-Adhkaar’ (1/84) and it has supporting evidence on the authority of ‘Aeysha which is Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion), see ‘Saheeh Abu Dawood’ (1345). [Silsilah  Daeefah 1/83]</div>
