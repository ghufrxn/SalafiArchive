				<h3>Story Of A Beautiful Woman In Makkah – Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Nov 03, 2016 9:55 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Shehzad Sattar</strong></div>
				<div class="content">As for the story that contains admonition and reflection in it, then it is that which is reported in the biography of <span style="color: #0000FF">‘Ubayd bin ‘Ameer Al-Makkee</span> in the <span style="color: #0000FF">“Thiqaat”</span> of Al-‘Ijlee, who said: “There used to be a beautiful woman in Makkah who was married. One day she looked at herself in the mirror and said to her husband: ‘Do you think there is anyone that can look at this face and not be enticed by it?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ So she enquired: ‘Who?’ He said: ”Ubayd bin ‘Ameer.’ So she said: ‘Grant me permission so that I may go entice him.’ He said: ‘I give you permission.’ So she went to see him and asked him for a fatwa (religious verdict). So he went with her to a part of Al-Masjid AlHaraam and sat in privacy with her. Then she uncovered her face, so that it looked like half of a moon. So he said to her: ‘O slave of Allaah, fear Allaah!'”<br /><br />The author of Al-Hilyah mentioned this story from <span style="color: #0000FF">“Ath-Thiqaat”</span> of Al-‘Ijlee in his biography of ‘Ubayd bin ‘Ameer Al-Makkee. <span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Albaanee</span> also mentioned it in his book on Hijaab using it as a proof for the niqaab (face-veil).<br /><br />The point of benefit that we can derive from this great noble scholar’s rebuking of that woman when she uncovered her face in front of him is that: The Taabi’een used to hold that a woman uncovering herself by unveiling her face in front of male strangers was a serious crime, which needed to be changed and great efforts needed to be made to terminate it. In fact, the matter should be this way, for indeed a person that looks at a woman’s face and hands, i.e. a woman he is prohibited from looking at, is enjoying the area of the body with the greatest temptation and the most severe in danger.<br /><br />Posted from e-Book: <a href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/21/the-obligation-of-veiling-the-face-and-hands-shaykh-zayd-al-madkhalee/" class="postlink">The Obligation of Veiling the Face and Hands</a> – Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah)<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/05/24/story-of-a-beautiful-woman-in-makkah-shaikh-zayd-al-madkhalee/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/05/24/s ... madkhalee/</a><!-- m --></div>
