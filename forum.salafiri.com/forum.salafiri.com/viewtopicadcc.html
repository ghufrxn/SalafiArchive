Rather, he should take his hand and sit with him in privacy. So if he [the ruler] accepts it, then he accepts it, and if he doesn’t, then he [the advisor] has performed what is required of him and what is for him.”</span><br /><br />The wording of this hadeeth is from Al-Haakim, and it is a sound hadeeth.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Look at the example of the Imaam of Ahlus Sunnah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah). He was beaten with a whip, dragged on the floor, and imprisoned due to the [the deviants’ claim] of the Qur`an being created. But in spite of this, he would refer to him [the ruler] as the “Commander of the Believers” and tell the people: “Do not rebel (against the leader); be patient.” Don’t we have a good example in our righteous predecessors? Or is it that we are more knowledgeable and braver than them?!</span><br /><br /><strong>Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in his book Jaami’ul-‘Uloom wal Hikam (pg. 113):<br /><br /><span style="color: #800000">“Sincere Advice to the Muslim leaders means cooperating with them upon the truth, obeying them, reminding them, cautioning them with gentleness and ease, preventing an uprise against them, and supplicating for them to be guided.”</span><br /><br /><strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> said in his book Raf’-ul-Asaateen fee Hukm-il-Ittisaal bis-Salaateen (pg. 81-82):<br /><br /> <span style="color: #800000">“It is well established in the Mighty Book (Qur`an) that we are commanded to obey the ruler. Allaah put obeying the rulers after obeying Him and obeying the Messenger (salallaahu ‘alaihiwasallam). There are many ahaadeeth in the purified Sunnah, i.e. the main collections, and other books that state that it is obligatory to obey them [the rulers] and to be patient with their oppression. One of the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (salallaahu ‘alaihiwasallam) commanded us to obey them [the rulers] consists of the words: ‘…even if he beats your back and takes your money.’ It is also authentically reported on him (salallaahu ‘alaihiwasallam) that he said:</span>  <span style="color: #FF0000">‘Give them what they are entitled to (of rights), and ask Allaah for what you are entitled to (of rights).</span><span style="color: #800000">‘”</span><br /><br />Note: From the comments that follow the 31st question and answer in Beneficial Answers to Questions on Innovated Methodologies.<br /><br />Source: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/05/22/imam-ahmad-a-good-example-of-implementing-the-sunnah-over-desires/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2011/05/22/imam-ahmad-a-good-example-of-implementing-the-sunnah-over-desires/</a></div>
