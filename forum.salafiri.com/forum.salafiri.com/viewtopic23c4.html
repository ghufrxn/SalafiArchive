				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">The correct way to form an opinion<br />Shaykh Abu Zaid Zameer حفظه الله </span></strong><br />〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰<br />There are two ways by which one could form an opinion about Islam:<br /><br />The first one is to form an opinion about Islam by studying its (authentic) sources (namely, the Qur’an and Sunnah). The second way is to form opinions off personal experiences that are either based on incomplete information or on anti-Islamic propaganda. The first method is not only based upon the correct principles of investigation but also on the values of justice and fairness, which the second method lacks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it appears that most people have adopted the second way to form our opinions. Consequently, Islam, which (according to its authentic sources) is a religion of mercy, appears to be peace-averse when seen through poor investigation and mal-intended, anti-Islamic propaganda.<br /><br />✏️<strong>English translation by Muaaz Gabbur</strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://t.me/shaykhabuzaidzameer/313">https://t.me/shaykhabuzaidzameer/313</a><!-- m --></div>
