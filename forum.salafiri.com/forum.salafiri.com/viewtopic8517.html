				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Merit Of Reciting Surah Al-Baqarah In The Home</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question: </span></strong><br /><br />“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Do not make your houses graves. Verily, Satan does not enter a house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited. Does this refer to reciting Surah Al-Baqarah only once when a person buys a new house, or each year, or each night? Is it sufficient to listen to the recitation on a cassette recorder?”<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer: </span></strong><br /><br />“There is no specified number of times for reciting Surah Al-Baqarah, but the Hadith indicates the legitimacy of filling houses with Salah (Prayer) and recitation of the Qur'an. It also indicates that Satan does not approach the houses in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited. Furthermore, not fixing a certain number of times for reciting this Surah signifies the desirability of reciting it frequently so as to ward off Satan and seek the great reward associated with that, as you will earn a good deed for every letter you recite, and a good deed gets a tenfold reward, as mentioned in another Hadith.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.”<br /><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta'<br /><ul>Shaykh 'Abdul-'Azeez bin 'Abdullaah bin Baaz<br />Shaykh 'Abdul-'Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh<br />Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Ghudayyaan<br />Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd</ul><br />Source: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alifta.net/">www.alifta.net</a><!-- w --> - The third question of Fatwa no. 18072</div>
