<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">By Shaykh Hussayn bin ‘Abdul-‘Azeez aal ash-Shaykh [May Allaah Preserve him], Imaam and Khateeb of Masjid an-Nabawee and a Senior Judge in the High Court in Madeenah</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ {1}<br /><br />وَرَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِي دِينِ اللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًا {2}<br /><br />فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّابًا {3}</span></span><br /><br />1. When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad) against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah),<br />2. And you see that the people enter Allah's religion (Islam) in crowds,<br />3. So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask for His Forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and forgives.<br />[Al-Nasr 110:1-3]<br /><br />It is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas [May Allaah be Pleased with him] was called to the council of the people of Badr and was asked to give his Tafseer of this Surah. He said that Surah refers to the death of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him].<br /><br />The scholars have stated that the reason for the statement of Ibn ‘Abbaas [May Allaah be Pleased with him] is that this Surah is the conclusion of the Da’wah of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] as this Surah was revealed in final Hajj of the Prophet.<br /><br />Fatima bint Muhammad [May Allaah be Pleased with her] was told by her father the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] about this Surah and she started crying and then he told her that she will be the next person to die and join him so she started laughing.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Help of Allaah’</span>: meaning the help of Allaah over the enemies.<br /><br />When the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] came to Makkah in order to liberate it, the local people who disbelieved were ready to come to fight against Islam and defend Makkah from Islaam. However,  when he entered Makkah and they saw some of the other the enemies submit to Allaah and become Muslim, they all submitted to Islaam, tribe by tribe.<br /><br />Therefore, this Surah shows that the promise of Allaah, the Most High, is true and that it was fulfilled upon the Messenger [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him].<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Glorify the Praises’</span>: (also known as Tasbeeh) means to magnify Allaah, to proclaim his perfectness and freeing Allaah from any imperfection. Sometimes in the Quraan, Tasbeeh can also refer to Salaah, as Allaah, the Most High, at times tells us to Glorify His Praises in the morning and the late afternoon, i.e. referring to Salaah.<br /><br />The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] explained that the meaning of Tasbeeh and Istaghfaar in this Surah by action. It is narrated that he bowed in Rukoo’ and would do Tasbeeh and Istighfaar in Rukoo.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">‘ask for His Forgiveness’</span>: It is prescribed to do this at the end of every good deed. The scholars have stated that seeking forgiveness in Allaah helps us to increase in doing good deeds and excuses us of any mistakes that we may have.<br /><br />This Surah gives us the lesson that the Muslims should increase in doing Dhikr and Salaah when they are in the state of ease of hardship. Whether they are safe or in the state of war.<br /><br />It is narrated that the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him], upon the conquering of Makkah, he prayed eight Rak’aat of Duhaa in the house of Umm Haani’ [May Allaah be Pleased with her] on the day of Fath. Therefore, this Surah also teaches us that we should gives thanks and Shukr at the end of gaining any form of favour from Allaah, the Most High. Giving thanks to Allaah, the Most High, is by doing good deeds, Dhikr and Salaah.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/tafseer-surah-nasr.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09 ... -nasr.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Sep 16, 2016 11:31 pm</p><hr />
