A delightfully soft and fruity date with fine texture.<br /><br />The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven Ajwa dates every morning he will not be harmed on that day by poison or magic.” [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5445) (5768) (5769) (5779)].<br /><br />The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Ajwa dates are from paradise.” [Tirmidhee (2068) he said hasan Saheeh and it was authenticated by Shaikh al-Albaani].<br /><br />Referring to eating seven Ajwa dates, the Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “He will not be harmed by anything until he reaches the evening.” [Saheeh Muslim (2047)].<br /><br />These dates cost around 70 Saudi Riyals per KiloGram.<br /><br />There are also “imitations” or some sold an inferior quality dates and “conned” the customers as “AJWA dates” To know whether its AJWA, look closely at the dates. There are very fine white lines on the dates.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Madina Dates Keep Away Harm</span></strong><br /><br />The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven dates between the two areas (the east and west of Madina) as soon as he wakes up every morning, he will not be harmed on that day by poison until the evening.” [Saheeh Muslim (154) (2047)].<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Dates In One’s Home</span></strong><br /><br />The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “O Aisha! A house that has no dates in it their family is hungry. Oh Aisha! A house that has no dates in it their family is hungry.” [Saheeh Muslim (153), (2046)]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/22/ajwa-dates/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/22/ajwa-dates/</a><!-- m --></div>
