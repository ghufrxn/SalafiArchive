				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Does ablution [1] become invalid by merely looking at women or men who are naked [2] ; also does it become void if a person looks at his own private parts [3] ?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> All praise is due to Allaah alone, and may the peace and blessings be with His Messenger, his family, and his companions.<br /><br />To proceed: The ablution of a person does not become invalid by merely looking at women and men who are in a state of nudity, or by simply seeing one’s private parts, as there is no evidence or proof with regards to this.<br /><br />Allaah is the possessor of all prosperity &amp; success, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be with our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Reference:</span></strong> <em>Fataawaa Al Lajnah Ad Daaimah, Volume 5: Fatwaa no: 6541</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Refer to Surah: 5 [Alma’idah] Ayah no: 6 in the Qur’aan for a description regarding the ablution Islamically known as (الوضوء). [TN]<br /><br />[2] Also can be translated as ‘no clothes on’. Imam Bihaaud-Deen Almaqdasi [555-624 AH] says: A person dressed [with clothes] that does not cover his private parts, is known as being nude and not dressed. Refer to ‘Aluddah’ explanation of ‘Alumdah’ Chapter of the Expiation of Oaths. [TN]<br /><br />[3] The Messenger of Allaah, peace &amp; blessings be with him described the private part of a Muslim man as being [at the end of a lengthy Hadeeth]: ‘That which is in between his navel and knees [regarded as being] his private part. Reported by Imam Darul-Qutnee in his Sunan, Hadeeth no: 876 which is graded as being Hasan [sound]. [TN]</div>
