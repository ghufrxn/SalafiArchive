			<div class="content">Part 1<br /><br />There are a number of posts which are circulating on social media, all in all of which attempt to criticise, defame and undermine the continuous efforts and struggles of,<br /><br />Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1420H)<br /><br />Some of these people, and I say this politely, have demonstrated dire comprehension of intricate issues while others have manifested their innate hatred and animosity for this Allamah Rabbani, based on nothing but tassub, tahazzub and their ignorance.<br /><br />The life and efforts of Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani are well known and comprehensively documented, and no one can deny this even if they tried. In reality we do not need to mention his virtues, his efforts and works. The words &quot;authenticated or graded xyz by al-Albani&quot; in almost every other Islamic book by friends and foes alike, is unprecedented virtue by any account.<br /><br />However, sometimes a general reminder to ourselves and to our mutual friends, puts things into perspective.<br /><br />Oh insignificant one's, Let us remind you of who al-Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani is.<br /><br />He was the man who was born in a european country, which was and still is virtually unknown, he was responsible for putting that country on the map for Muslims, academics as well orientalists. Who knew Albania except through our Allamah.<br /><br />He was forced to move from his country at a young age due to communism. He moved to Syria with his family who were strict practising Hanafis. They made fun of him in the classroom while he excelled beyond degree in his Arabic language, syntax and morphology compared to his fellow classmates. They would say what does this Ajami know.<br /><br />He was ostracised, shunned and thrown out of his family home by his strict hanafi family due to his firmness in sticking to the Quran and Sunnah.<br /><br />Poor and destitute, worked as an honest watchmaker, who would look for scraps of pieces of paper to write prophetic Hadith on, to the extent he would write complete volumes of books in this way<br />He would travel the city to the library and the locals would make fun of him due to him riding a bike, they ridiculed him nationally in their newspapers.<br /><br />He was imprisoned in syria by the mulhid bathists Alawite shias, numerous times for teaching the Quran and Sunnah as well propagating Salafi Dawah. He was put in prison repeatedly and tested with their evil plots time and time again.<br /><br />He was forced to move to Jordan, than UAE, then Syria again and then to Jordan, due to the hatred of the innovator heretics.<br /><br />He single handedly rebuked and took charge of chief innovators and clear deviants a like. These deviants were the heads of misguidance who misguided thousands to innovations and corrupt beliefs and heresies, from the likes of<br /><br />The heretical Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the chief innovator who reviled everyone from the Sahabah to the Great Salaf us-Salihin<br /><br />His student, Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah the Asharite Hanafi apologist and proponent of the Deobandis<br /><br />The Syrian Sufi Asharite, Muhammad Said Ramadhan Buti.<br /><br />Then he dealt with, not 1, not 2 but three of the Ghumari brothers of Morocco, Ahmad, Abdullah and Abd al-Aziz.<br /><br />He took charge and held at Bay the evil heresies and ideas of Abdullah al-Harari ie the founder of the al-Ahbash and his cult beliefs.<br /><br />He answered and dealt with the rafidi arch liar, Hassan Saqqaf.<br /><br />Also the Deobandi and dubious Habib ur Rehman al-Azmi, who did not have the guts use his real name, he was also answered and subdued. <br /><br />And the list, by the permission and assistance of Allah alone is continuous.<br /><br />The man who checked over 30,000 ahadith and wrote over 200 books, some of which run into volumes!<br /><br />The man who single handedly organised the whole of maktabah Zahiriyyah library, which was one of the most important libraries of the Islamic world.<br /><br />The man who produced some of the most prolific students and formidable scholars this century has seen.<br /><br />And then......you have the audacity to attack this man with your childish and immature remarks!<br /><br />We do not go beyond bounds in praise of our Ulama and neither do we make open blind taqlid of them,<br /><br />However after praising Allah, we thank him for sending us this mujaddid. May Allah have mercy on him, forgive him and accept his efforts and servitude. Amin<br /><br />Oh ignorant ones, whoever you are, know your maqam and manzilah when you talk about<br /><br />*Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani*<br /><br />Your brother<br />Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</div>

			<div class="content">Part 2<br /><br />The Hanafi Fiqh Channels Recent video on Allamah Rabbani Imam Shaikh Muhammad Nāsir ud-Dīn al-Albani by the Bradford crew<br /><br />Hanafi Ash'ari's on the Hadith in Sahih Muslim - Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his Madhhab Fanatacism<br /><br />Yet again, recently the intellectual prowess of some people arose in Bradfud, the Ash'ari Deobandi's in conjunction with the ta'an ie slanderous accusation on the name Abu Hanifah as the Hanafi Fiqh Channel.<br /><br />They released a video on the categorisation and grading of Shaikh al-Albani concerning the ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. Posts of this nature will by no means explain or clarify such intricate and fine issues of the science of Hadith and illal. This inshaAllah, is to be addressed in due course.<br /><br />This manipulative presentation and associated distortions are nothing new from these Ash'ari Deobandi's, as their scholars, other Ash’arites as well underlings of this camp have presented other deceitful allegations. They alleged that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani also rendered some ahadith in Sahih Muslim to be weak, again this is not the place to enter into these issues.<br /><br />However, what I wanted to share was the horrible double standards these people employ and how they turn a blind eye to their own scholars, Shuyukhs they revere. It highlights how these people disastrously forget the true reality, yet under the guise of attacking and vilifying Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, they develop selective amnesia.<br /><br />This being said, we hope the honest reader who fears Allah and the last day can judge for himself and see the truth and the double standards.<br /><br />Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah, the student of Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, the one who lauded the Deobandi Echelons and his understanding of the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani said<br /><br />“I first met Shaikh Abdul-Fattaah Abu Guddah in his city, Aleppo, more than twenty years ago approximately. I realised that he was a man who was bigoted towards the Hanafi madhhab such that he blindly followed it when in his mosque in Aleppo he agreed to the permissibility of treating someone with alcohol under the supervision of a skilled, Muslim doctor.<br /><br />So I said to him, “This is not enough. The doctor must also be well-acquainted with the Sunnah. For in the Sunnah, for example, alcohol has been described as being a disease and not a cure. So how can a Muslim doctor who knows the Sharee’ah prescribe a cure which the Prophet, صلى الله عليه وسلم, described as being a disease?!”<br /><br />So he said, “Perhaps the hadith is weak or not authentic!” I replied, “How can it be when it is in Sahih Muslim?” So he said, “We will go back and check it to make sure.”<br /><br />So one of the people who was present and he was a friend to both parties in the debate said, “So when you do check and find out that it is authentic, will you act upon it or what the madhhab says?”<br /><br />So he replied, “The madhhab!”<br /><br />(Hayat al-Allamah al-Albani Bi Qalamihi (p.38-41)<br /><br />So what does Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah say, he says he will check the Hadith in SAHIH MUSLIM because he considered it to be weak or the fact that he did not even know it was in SAHIH MUSLIM<br /><br />Dear readers, and we have not even directed our attention to Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari yet and this is not even the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />We will inshaAllah, with the permission and aid of Allah alone show the historical assertions the Hanafi Ash’arites have made concerning the Sahihs of Imam’s Bukhari and Muslim.<br /><br />Abu Khuzaimah Ansari</div>

			<div class="content">Part 3<br /><br />The Hanafi Fiqh Chanel have produced two videos showing that Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani weakened ahadith in Sahih al-Bukhari. As I mentioned in the previous part, we will address the issues a little later In Shāʿ Allāh.<br /><br />Following on from the previous part where I showed the position and outlook of Abdul Fattah Abu Guddah and his understanding of Sahih Muslim-the authenticity of the hadith contained therein, it showed his blind fanaticism for the hanafi madhab and his true position of the hadith in Sahih Muslim. This was an answer to the second video produced by the Hanafi Fiqh channel wherein the speaker talks about Sahih Muslim. (please refer to part 2)<br /><br />Both speakers in their respective parts digress to mention some comical points throughout their videos. They contained cheap shots and immature presentation of points. For example, they said we know the Salafi group attacks the four Imams, we did not know they would attack Sahih al-Bukhari and other such illiterate type of points. We assure you, do not worry, since you have opened this closet your hanafi skeletons will most certainly come to haunt you. More on this In Shāʿ Allāh in the forthcoming parts.<br /><br />We will however overlook these points and not stoop to their level, whereas our intent is to bring clarity to these matters and the mindset, these young brothers wish to portray of Shaikh Allamah Rabbani Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.<br /><br />Here is another example how juvenile and childish these people are. When they mention Shaikh al-Albani’s name they say Nasir ud Din, when we all know the Shaikhs full name is Muhammad Nasir ud Din. This is the level of these people, such is their hatred and animosity that they can not even bring themselves to say the name Muhammad.<br /><br />Anyway, Shaikh al-Albani talks about the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and he looked at how some of the hadith which did not fulfill the criteria. He talks about Imams before him, like Imam Daraqutni, Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Hafiz Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, Hafiz Ibn Hajr and Hafiz al-Mundhiri, who also spoke about some of the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and their wording.<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani gives three examples to highlight what he refers to when he did a generic gloss of the Sahihayn, and it is not as the detractors make out, that he scrutinized and analysed the whole of Sahih al-Bukhari. Shaikh al-Albani clearly says his contention is with just about 10 ahadith and that Imam Daraqutni questions 12 or so hadith from the Sahih of Imam Bukhari.<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani clearly said,<br /><br />“Therefore, it is not wisdom or knowledge for me to focus on critiquing the Sahihayn and abandon the hadith in the 4 sunans.” (watch video)<br /><br />Shaikh al-Albani also said,<br /><br />“If a person questions my judgements of some of the hadiths, then they can look at Fath al-Bari and they will find many many things that are criticized by Hafiz Ahmad bin Hajr al-Asqalani.” (watch video)<br /><br />He also said,<br /><br />“This Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani clarified in his Sharh (Fath al-Bar) many mistakes in the ahadith of Bukhari…” (watch video)<br /><br />From the three examples Shaikh al-Albani talks about is the hadith of Ibn Abbas radiAllahu Anhuma concerning the marriage of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to Maymunah radhiallahu anha while he was in ihram, he said the hadith is authentic in terms of its chains but the interpretation is of Ibn Abbas RadiAllahu Anhuma. Other ahadith that are critiqued are based on the narrators in the chain, this is the second type. With the third type being additional words added to the hadith to indicate a meaning that were not actually transmitted, like the hadith of the limbs radiating light due to being frequently washed in Wudu.<br /><br />These are just some of the points that relate to this intricate science, and it is most certainly not for every individual to delve into it. This is more applicable and pertinent to those who proudly claim and openly attest they are hanafi muqallids ie in other words, they are strikingly ignorant.<br /><br />This being said, other modern day writers in academia have also alluded to Shaikh al-Albani weakening hadith in Bukhari, at least three different writers. Yet the same writers have strangely overlooked and ignored the criticism and views of Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Fath and Imam Daraqutni’s queries. One of the aforementioned writers, in all fairness did look at Daraqutni’s queries and presented his arguments. Interestingly a fourth writer asserts Sahih al-Bukhari is the backbone of Salafi Islam, as the writer suggests. This is not far from the truth as Shaikh al-Albani was one of the most famous proponents of Salafiyyah, since when have the modern day Hanafi Ash’arites shown any care or love for Sahih al-Bukhari, except they worked on it to defend their Madhhab.<br /><br />Such writers and others like Hamza Malyabari and of his ilk suggest Shaikh al-Albani’s critical analysis of hadith was not in line with the methods of the earlier scholars. This is another farcical allegation which has been rebutted by many writers. The following book, being just one example dismantles and dismisses this embarrassing claim.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

			</div><br /><br />Shaikh Zakariyyah bin Ghulam Qadir Pakistani<br /><br />(pp.280, Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ma’arif Lil-Nashr wal-Tawzi’a, 1431H/2010ce) <br /><br />The point being, such matter are based of Ijtihad in relation to understanding the intricacies of this magnificent science, and only those who are free from the shackles of extreme blind partisanship and destructive fanaticism can look at such matters objectively. This excludes the extreme muqallids who vehemently acknowledge they are ignorant and are obligated to perform taqlid, yet they are the ones making youtube videos, reading the ahadith from Bukhari to show the inconsistencies and approach of the Salafi’s but they themselves reject the hadith in Bukhari when it is time to accept and act on them. This is most reprehensible!<br /><br />Low and behold, here is the clarification from Allamah Rabbani Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud Din al-Albani when he was asked if he graded hadith in Bukhari weak and if the Scholars before him preceded him in it. Please watch it and be sincere without bigotry or sectarian partisanship.<br /><br /><center><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u5bJlhRSLFY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></div>
