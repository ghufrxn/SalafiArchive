				<h3>The Soorahs That Have Been Singled Out For the Classification of Tawheed</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Soorahs That Have Been Singled Out For the Classification of Tawheed</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>by Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree Rahimahullaah</em><br /><br />Shaykh Hammaad bin Muhammad al-Ansaaree (rahimahullaah) said: And this soorah (al-Faatihah) is from the collection of soorahs which have been singled out for (the explanation of) Tawheed. And the soorahs which have been singled out for Tawheed are four in the Noble Qur'aan:<br /><br /><em>a) Soorah al-Faatihah<br /><br />b) Soorah al-Kaafiroon<br /><br />c) Soorah &quot;Qul huwalLaahu Ahad&quot;<br /><br />d) Soorah al-Falaq</em><br /><br />Each of them has classified the (particular type of) Tawheed that pertains to it specifically.<br /><br />For example, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Soorah al-Faatihah</span> has classified the <span style="color: #0000FF">whole of Tawheed</span>.<br /><br />And <span style="text-decoration: underline">Soorah al-Kaafiroon</span> comprises <span style="color: #0000FF">Tawheed ul-Uloohiyyah, that is (Tawheed of) `Ibaadah.</span><br /><br />And <span style="text-decoration: underline">Soorah &quot;Qul huwalLaahu Ahad&quot;</span> comprises <span style="color: #0000FF">Tawheed ul-Asmaa was-Sifaat</span>.<br /><br />And <span style="text-decoration: underline">Soorah al-Falaq</span> comprises <span style="color: #0000FF">Tawheed ur-Ruboobiyyah</span>.<br /><br />And if this indicates anything, it indicates the importance of Tawheed, because Allaah revealed for every type of this Tawheed a complete Soorah. And this was not the case for the rulings (ahkaam) at all, and nor in the furoo` (subsidiary matters), just as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;And we did not create the Jinn and Men except that they may worship Me&quot;</span></strong> (51:56), His saying, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;that they may worship Me&quot;, is Tawheed.</span></strong><br /><br />And the first command in the Book of Allaah is the command to worship, as occurs in Soorah al-Baqarah, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;O mankind, worship your Lord&quot;</span></strong> (2:21).<br /><br />From this we have come to know that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic's revealing of four soorahs, each of them comprising Tawheed, is an indication of the importance of Tawheed, and that it is the secret behind the creation of Jinn and Men.<br /><br /><em>Rasaa'il fil-`Aqeedah, p.18 (Maktabah al-Furqaan).</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://islamtees.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/the-soorahs-that-have-been-singled-out-for-the-classification-of-tawheed/">https://islamtees.wordpress.com/2011/12 ... f-tawheed/</a><!-- m --></div>
