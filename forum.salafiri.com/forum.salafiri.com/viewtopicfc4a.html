They are intelligent creatures:</span><br /><br />A) The Hudhud (hoopoe) understood Tawheed better than many amongst the mankind even to this day. [Surah al-Naml (27): 20-26]<br /><br />B) The ant informing other ants to take shelter so that they do not get trampled by the army of Sulaimaan عليه السلام. [Surah al-Naml (27): 17-<br /><br />۩•۞•۝•۞•۩<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">2. They are devoted creatures:</span><br /><br />A) The animals, especially the birds, glorify Allaah’s praises but most of the mankind does not know. {Surah al-Anbiyaa (21): 79; Surah al-Noor (24): 41; Surah al-Naml (27): 17; Surah Saba (34): 10; Surah Saad (38): 19]<br /><br />B) The ants glorify Allaah [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree and Saheeh Muslim]<br /><br />C) The fish seeks forgiveness for the one seeking knowledge.<br /><br />۩•۞•۝•۞•۩<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">3. We have been commanded to be kind towards the animals:</span><br /><br />A) The Hadeeth of the man fetching water for the thirsty dog.<br /><br />B) The Hadeeth of the prostitute fetching water for the thirsty dog.<br /><br />C) The instructions to sharpen the knife before slaughtering.<br /><br />D) The instructions to avoid slaughtering in front of other animals.<br /><br />۩•۞•۝•۞•۩<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">4. We have been warned not to be cruel towards animal:</span><br /><br />A) The Hadeeth of a Prophet who burned the colony of ants because only one ant bit him. So Allaah sent revelation to him saying that the ants glorify Allaah [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree and Saheeh Muslim]<br /><br />B) The woman who was punished for tying her cat and not allowing it to feed till it died out of starvation.<br /><br />C) The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم instructing his Companion to return the egg to the bird out of mercy for the bird [al-Adab al-Mufrad]<br /><br />۩•۞•۝•۞•۩<br /><br />Islaam cares for all the living creation but we also condemn unlawful killing in general whether the victim is a Muslim or not. Killing even a single person unlawfully is like killing the whole of Mankind:<br /><br />{Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind.} [Surah al-Maaidah (5): 32]<br /><br />But we care more for the Muslim no matter what, for the blood of the Muslim is priceless:<br /><br />The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “If this world were to be destroyed, that would be less significant before Allaah تعالى than the unlawful killing of a believer.” [Sunan al-Tirmidhee, Sunan al-Nasaa`ee and Sunan Ibn Maajah and graded as “Saheeh” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]</div>
