<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Speech of Allaah is Never Ending</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Posted on September 5, 2014 <br /></span><br /><strong>by Saad Burbank</strong><br /><br />Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad – may Allaah preserve him – mentions in his book ‘Min Kunoozil Quraanil Kareem, Tafseeru Aayaatinn Minal Kitaabil Azeez’ (From the Treasures of the Noble Quraan, Explanation of Verses From the Mighty Book) pg. 259:<br /><br />Sooratul-Kahf<br /><br />His Saying – He the Most High:<br /><br />قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا<br /><br />Say, “If the sea were ink for [writing] the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement.”<br /><br />[Sooratul Kahf; 18:109]<br /><br />In this noble verse is a clarification that the Speech of Allaah – the Most High – is never ending, and will never be exhausted, and that even if the seas were ink for writing the Speech of Allaah, the seas would be exhausted – even if they were to be multiplied.<br /><br />This is because their water is limited, and the Speech of Allaah does not come to an end; because it is unlimited and never-ending, and this is because Allaah – the Most High – has no beginning, so there is no beginning to His Speech; and He has no end, so there is no end to His Speech.<br /><br />And similar to this verse is His – the Most High – saying in Soorah Luqmaan:<br /><br />وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ<br /><br />And if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea [was ink], replenished thereafter by seven [more] seas, the words of Allah would not be exhausted. Verily, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.<br /><br />[Soorah Luqmaan; 31:27]<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/09/05/the-speech-of-allaah-is-never-ending/</strong><br /><br />Share this:<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Sep 01, 2016 11:02 am</p><hr />
