				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Some Memoirs of Allamah Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer [1407H]</span></span></strong><br /><em>Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibbaan Abu Khuzaimah Anssari</em><br /> <br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">On Tawheed</span></strong><br /><br />Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer (Rahimahullaah) said, <br /><br /><ul>    “The greatest benefit of tawheed is that after accepting the belief of tawheed a person totally frees himself from the fear of anything other than Allaah and he does not fear anything. As the person with tawheed has certainty, as Allaah said,</ul><br />    <strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><ul>“There is no deity except him, the giver of life and death.”</ul></span></strong><br /><br />    <ul>So life rests in his hands as well as death and no one other than him can give us death nor can anyone give life. Whosoever has the belief that the one in the grave in Gujraat or the one in Lahore can give us death then most certainly they will not fear The Great One, Allaah, then who will they fear. And as for those people who hold the belief that if all the universe was to unite they would not be able to harm anyone except by the will of Allaah and these people do not fear anything except Allaah.” (Qur’aan and Hadeeth Conference, Siyaalkot, February 29th 1987)</ul><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Methodology Of Ahlul-Hadeeth</span></strong><br /><br />Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer said,<br /><br />    <ul>“If there is a methodology if this world which is clear and straight without any defects or like the methodology which the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam) taught the companions fourteen hundred years (1,400) ago, then it is only the methodology of the Ahlul-Hadeeth and not any other methodology in this world today. It is only this methodology that does not accept any kind of addition from anyone whereas other methodologies have added the statements of their saints, of their scholars of hadeeth, of their jurist or their holy people.</ul><br />    <ul>All praise be to Allaah that the Ahlul-Hadeeth have not added anything into the religion nor have they ever accepted it and neither will they allow any such additions to be made to the religion of Muhammad (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam).” (Jaamia Islaamiyyah LilBinaat, GT Road Owkara, 6th May, 1985)</ul><br />Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer said,<br /><br />    <ul>“Oh brothers, we have never called towards an individual nor do we call to a town or village nor to our major scholars, we only call towards Allaah and Muhammad (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam), and there is no one more virtuous then him and nor will there be. Allaah does not allow an equal to him in his tawheed nor does the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaalhu Alayhee Wasalam) consider anyone to be equal to him in his prophethood, as without accepting them a person has no Eemaan. The methodology of Ahlul-Hadeeth is straight and clear, so I challenge you, show us one issue, any one issue in our methodology that is contrary to the Sunnah, if so we will abandon it immediately.” (Jaamia Thanayyah, Saahiwaal, 18th April 1984)</ul><br />Allaamah Ehsaan Elaahee Zaheer said,<br /><br />    <em>“It is great pleasure for us that our every word is not from us rather the centre of our beliefs and ideologies are from the Book and the Sunnah. Ask any of the methodologies other than the way of Ahlul-Hadeeth in this world today that whatever they say today is it what the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasalam) said. None of them can claim their every word is from the Book and the Sunnah. There is no difference of opinion on the Book of Allaah and the statements of Muhammad (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasalam) differences and disputes only arise when a third entity comes forward other than the statements of Allaah and his Messenger (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasalam). So we say openly in comparison to the Book and the Sunnah any third opinion has not value. When we mention Imaam Bukhaari, Imaam Muslim and other scholars of hadeeth then this is not because they have said something of their own accord rather they have conveyed the statements of the Messenger of Allaah (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) to us.</em><br /><br />    <em>I have seen this in many arab countries that wherever the light of the Book and sunnah has reached the Ahlul-Hadeeth are also there this is because there is no other methodology more clearer, fine, radiant and bright as clear as the methodology of Ahlul-Hadeeth.” (Jaamia Muhamadiyyah, Gujranwala, 26th June, 1981)</em></div>
