I informed the Prophet (ﷺ) about it and he said, 'It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.' The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Recorded by Bukhari, 338 and Muslim, 798.</em><br /><br /><em>- This is the view of the Hanabila, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul Qayyim.</em><br /><br />Taken from:<br />السعي الحثيث في فقه أهل الحديث<br />Pg. 124 - 125</div>
