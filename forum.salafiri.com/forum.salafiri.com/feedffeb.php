<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong><span style="color: #0000BF">Incorporating Zikr with Breathing<br /></span></strong></span><br /><br />Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, the founding elder and revered saint of the Deobandis explains the method of exhaling (i.e. breathing) while doing Zikr he says:<br /><br /><strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #000080">[The First Method]<br />“A human should be attentive and conscious with every breath. Without Pas Anfas [exhaling or breathing in a specific way with Zikr] a mans heart can never be cleansed from blackness and darkness. Pas Anfas according to the terminology of the Sufis means while inhaling and exhaling [air], whether loudly or quietly to make zikr. While breathing he should say “illalAllah” only with the breath and while exhaling he should say “La Ilaha”. However, while make zikr quietly he should make it with his breath. While inhaling and exhaling he should direct his attention [or look] at his navel and close his mouth. This should be done without moving the tongue, and with consistency and vigour the breathing in of itself should inadvertently make zikr.” (Imdadullah Makki, Dhiya al-Qulub, p.18-19, a part of Kuliyyat Imdadiyyah)</span><br /></div></blockquote></strong><br /><br />The annotator said:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong><span style="color: #000080">“Pas Anfas (breathing with or to make Zikr) has many forms. Some people say 'Allah' with every breath, some say ‘Huwaz Zahir Huwal Batin Ya Hayyu Ya Quyyum’ others say ‘Haq Haq’, some say ‘Ya Huwa’ and some say ‘Haq Huwa’ and all of them allow you to achieve your intended objective.”</span></strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />So, not only does Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki encourage a method of innovation to make Zikr, he introduces other aspects that oppose the teachings of Islam. For example,<br /><br /><strong>1. Linking Zikr with the cycle of breathing<br />2. Linking the Kalimah with the cycle of breathing and breaking down the Kalimah into two parts while omitting other parts.<br />3. Making Zikr with the breath, without moving the tongue.<br />4. Directing his attention to his navel while making this Zikr<br />5. To close his mouth, without moving his tongue while breathing through the nose to make zikr with the breathing.</strong><br /><br />This method opposes the Sunnah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam. A man said, <em><strong>“O Messenger of Allah, the laws of Islam are too many for me, so tell me something I can hold onto.” The Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, said, ‘Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah.’</strong></em> (al-Tirmidhi no.3375, Graded authentic by Shaykh al-Albani)<br /><br />This Deobandi elder opposed the teaching of the Nabi Salallahu alayhi Wasallam and innovated new methods in Zikr. This shows the true reality of those who are highly revered amongst the Deobandi’s.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=192" class="postimage" alt="kuliyat 18b.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=193" class="postimage" alt="kuliyat 19.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sat Jun 20, 2020 12:57 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #000080">The Deobandi Barelwi Belief of Fana (Annihilation) - Becoming One with Allah</span></span></strong><br /><br />Mawlana Mohammad Yasir Deobandi and Mawlana Asrar Rashid Barelwi both Hanafi Ash'ari Maturidis were very quick to defame Salafis because of an irrelevant and innovative discussion that occurred in a park in London, whether Allah can enter his creation of not?<br /><br />The Hanafi defenders went on a diatribe, while Asrar showed his usual hallmark of speaking Ill of Shaykh ul-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and accusing Salafis of anthropomorphism and corporeality. Muhammad Yasir, again true to his Ash'ari Jahmite theology, ran with the no space and direction argument, he lied on Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal and last but not least, he attacked the Salafis.<br /><br />These two Ash'ari Maturidis, took a huge exception to the response of whether Allah can enter the creation. So, I wonder what they would say about the flowing passage, in which Haji Imdadullah, and lets forget about Allah entering creation, he offers a Sufi ritualistic practise that will aid a Sufi disciple to become and exist with Allah.<br /><br />Fana is also defined and understood that when the Sufi succeeds in purifying himself entirely of the earthly world and loses himself in the love of Allah, it is said that he has “annihilated” his individual will and “passed away” from his own existence to live only in Allah and with Allah.<br /><br /><strong>The Belief of Annihilation</strong><br />Mawlana Imdadullah Muhajjir Makki, the spiritual guide of the Hanafi Ash'ari Deobandis and Barelwis says while explaining a Sufi zikr ritual, which affirms Allah and negates everything else. He says.<br /><br /><strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #000080">Since the Zikr of illalAllah is of the heart therefore one should understand illalAllah from the core of his heart. (Similarly) He should integrate his own Dhat and Sifat with the DHAT AND SIFAT OF ALLAH in such a manner that it negates that which is excluded from illalAllah. When the Salik (murid/Sufi disciple) achieves this station, it eventually surpasses the heart and reaches the level of the soul. Therefore, since the Zikr of the soul is the Zikr of Ism (i.e Allah Hu), therefore the Salik should focus on saying the Ism of the Dhat (of Allah ie. Allah Hu) in such a manner that the Alif and Lam, which is a part of Allah, does not remain and you are just left with Hu. When the Salik reaches this station, he should exclusively and solely focus on Zikr, and in this way he surpasses this level of the soul and reaches the level of the mind. Thereafter, he should absorb and immerse himself in the Zikr of Hu Hu to such an extent that he himself, the aforementioned becomes Allah. This is the meaning of Fana Dar Fana and when one achieves this station, he becomes Nur from head to toe.<br /><br />(Imdadullah Makki, Dhiya al-Qulub, 17-18, part of Kulliyat Imdadiyyah)</span></span><br /></div></blockquote></strong><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=188" class="postimage" alt="cover Kuliyat.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=190" class="postimage" alt="kuliyat 17.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=191" class="postimage" alt="kulliyat-18.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br />This is the true Creed of the Deobandi founding fathers as well as the Barelwis. The Creed of Ahlus Sunnah and Ahl al-Hadith is free from such evil deviation which has no authentic from the Quran or Sunnah.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Fri Jun 19, 2020 2:28 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Traveling With The Tablighis: Shaykh Salih Al Fawzan</span></strong><br /><br />بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Q: Here there are some brothers who affiliate with Jamaa’at-ut-Tabligh, and quite often they invite us to go out with them. They use as a proof  to claim that they are upon the truth (the fact that) an abundance of people, whether they be non Muslim or otherwise from all over the world, have been guided as a result of them. So how do we respond to this?</span></strong><br /><br />A: We say in response to them; who is it that has been guided to tawheed as a result of them? Is it an individual from the disbelievers, an innovator, or a grave worshiper who consequently abandoned polytheism and repented to Allah (he who now knows tawheed) as a result of them? They only encourage people to repent from sins but they do not stand (clearly and openly) against polytheism ever, nor do they warn against it. Consequently grave worship in their countries is plentiful yet they do not oppose it. So what does this mean? What dawah is this? In addition, they encourage people to repent from sins, yet they introduce them to innovations that they themselves practice.<br /><br />Translated by Najeeb Al Anjelesi<br /><br />Source:  شرح الأصول الستَّة<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pureislaam.com/2015/11/15/traveling-with-the-tablighis-shaykh-salih-al-fawzan/">http://pureislaam.com/2015/11/15/travel ... al-fawzan/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 9:59 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Tablighi Doubt Debunked</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</span></strong><br /><br />As salaamu Alaykum,<br /><br />Brothers and sisters please be cautious of the doubt thrown by Jamaa’atut Tabligh in order to legitimize their innovation. They say, <span style="color: #FF0000">“Why do you criticize us for innovation while you know the combining of the Quran into one book is an innovation (it wasn’t done during the time of the Prophet -sallahu alayhi wa salaam-) and Umar gathering the people in order to pray tarawih behind one imam is an innovation. These are good innovations.”</span><br /><br />They misrepresent the statement of our Messenger -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- to substantiate their claim where he said:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Whoever establishes a good practice in Islam, there is a reward for him and a reward (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him, without there being a diminishing in their reward. But whoever establishes an evil practice in Islam, there is for him sin and the sin (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him, without there being a diminishing in their sin.”</span></strong><br /><br />In order to understand the intent of the Prophet -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- one must understand the circumstance that caused him to make the statement. As Jarir ibn Abdullah (the narrator of the hadith) stated, “While we were with Allah’s Messenger at the start of the day a group of people who were barefooted and destitute, wearing stripped woolen clothes or cloaks, with their swords hung around their necks, enter upon him. The majority of them were from Mudar, in fact all were from Mudar. The face of Allah’s Messenger -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- changed as a result of what he saw from them of poverty. So he entered (his home) and eventually exited. He ordered Bilal (to call the adhan), and he called it and the iqamah. So he prayed and afterwards addressed the people. He said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">يأيها الناس اتقوا ربكم الذي خلقكم من نفسٍ واحد</span><br /><br />“O mankind! Fear your lord who created you from one soul..”<br /><br />until he -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- reached the last portion of the verse<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">إن الله كان عليكم رقيباً</span><br /><br />“Indeed Allah is ever observant of you.”<br /><br />And he -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- cited the verse in Al Hashr<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">و اتقوا الله و لتنظر نفس ما قدمت لغدٍ و اتقوا الله</span><br /><br />“And fear Allah and let every soul look to what it puts forth for the morrow and fear Allah.”<br /><br />A man gives from his dinars, dirhams, clothing, a saa of wheat, and a saa of dates (until he said) even if it’s half a date. As a result a man from the ansar came with a bundle that he could barely lift (in order to give its contents away as charity), on the contrary he couldn’t lift it. The people followed continuously until I saw two piles of food and clothing, then I saw the face of Allah’s Messenger -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- glistening as if it was gold and he -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- said:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Whoever establishes a good practice in Islam, there is a reward for him and a reward (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him, without there being a diminishing in their reward. But whoever establishes an evil practice in Islam, there is for him sin and the sin (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him, without there being a diminishing in their sin.” </span></strong> <br /><br />That was the circumstance that caused the Prophet -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- to make this statement, and the scholars elucidate the intent of his speech. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al Uthaymin said, “If someone says what is the correlation between these two decisive, clear, and general statements <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Every novelty is an (accursed) innovation”</span></strong> and his -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- statement, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Whoever establishes a good practice in Islam, there is a reward for him and a reward (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him…”</span></strong><br /><br />The answer is from two perspectives:<br /><br />The first perspective: The meaning of his speech, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Whoever establishes a good practice in Islam”</span></strong> whoever initiates an action in accordance with the Sunnah. The indication of this is the fact that the Prophet -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- mentioned it after urging (the people) to give charity to those who arrived in Medina. So each companion came with that which was easy for him, and a man from the ansar came with a bundle too heavy for his hands (to carry) and he placed it at the lap of the Prophet -sallahu alayhi wa salaam-. As a result he -sallahu alayhi wa salaam- said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Whoever establishes a good practice in Islam, there is a reward for him and a reward (for him) of whoever acts in accordance with it after him…”</span></strong> meaning whoever initiates a firmly established sunnah (that which is found in the text), and it is not that he comes with a new practice…”<br /><br />Shaykh Uthaymin states concerning the second perspective, “Whoever arrives at the enacting of that which was legislated previously (but never actualized) like the companions combining the separated manuscripts (of the Quran) into one book. There’s no doubt that this is a good practice…”  [شرح الأربعين النووية]<br /><br />As the Quran was always legislated to be one book as is seen all throughout it being referred to as “the Book.” So beware of the utterly flimsy doubt of the tablighis and Sufis in this regard.<br /><br />Written by Najeeb Al Anjelesi<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pureislaam.com/2015/08/26/a-tablighi-doubt/">http://pureislaam.com/2015/08/26/a-tablighi-doubt/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 9:55 am</p><hr />

The Prophet s.a.w taught us to say “Bismillah” before Wudhoo, there is no Dua during the Wudhoo, thereafter when one has completed doing Wudhoo he must say:<br /><br /> <br /><br />أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاّ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لا شَريـكَ لَـهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمّـداً عَبْـدُهُ وَرَسـولُـه<br /><br />OR<br /><br />سُبْحـانَكَ اللّهُـمَّ وَبِحَمدِك أَشْهَـدُ أَنْ لا إِلهَ إِلاّ أَنْتَ أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتوبُ إِلَـيْك<br /><br />OR<br /><br />اللّهُـمَّ اجْعَلنـي مِنَ التَّـوّابينَ وَاجْعَـلْني مِنَ المتَطَهّـرين<br /><br /> <br />There is no such thing as Reciting Surah Al Qadr or reciting bismillah and Kalima upon washing each and every part during wudhoo. Molana Ashraf Ali thanvi says in the same bahishti zevar part 1, Aqeedo ka bayaan, Masla no.22 that:<br /><br />“Allah and his messenger sal Allahu alyhi wasallam HAVE SHOWN ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO DEEN IN QURAN AND HADITH. To bring something new into the deen is not permitted. Such new things are known as Bid’aat (Innovations). An Innovation is a major sin.”<br /><br />We dont find any proof of this act from Quran or hadeeth and hence this act is an innovation. The Prophet s.a.w said: “…every innovation is misguidance and all misguidance is in the Hellfire.” Sunan an-Nasaa’ee (1/224).<br /><br /> <br />If deobandi brothers try to justify this then they have no right to condem Barelwis for their innovations nor do deobandis have the right to do long talks against innovations. Allaah knows best. May Allah guide us all and may Allah protect us from every kinds of innovations (Bid’aat) in Islam. May Allaah keep us united on the path of Quran and Sunnah and may Allah open up our pathways as we strive in his cause to spread Islam. Ameen.

I have nothing to say about the taweez being written on the left thigh of a woman but I ask my brothers and sisters that adhere to this book to please help me increase my knowledge for the sake of Allaah and tell me if its alright to tie quranic aayah on thighs of women. Allah has given us thighs that is very very near the private parts. Is there Any Quranic aayah, any sahi hadeeth or any saying of Imam Abu Hanifa rahimahullah to justify this?

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Deobandi’s and Black Magic</span></strong><br /><br />As other Sufis, many Deobandis are also involved in magic, and this shows that many of the Sufis so-called Tasarrufat (controls) and karamat are in fact the works of Jinns and they use magic and Jinns to fool people and make them think they have Karamat from Allah and many of their ignorant followers are deceived by this.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ashraf Ali Thanvi and magic to separate between two persons</span></strong><br /><br />Ashraf Ali Thanvi wrote a book called “A’mal e Qurani”, a book of invocations, Ta’wizat (Tamaim) and ‘Amaliyat (Sufi formulas).<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526718.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526718.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In this book, p 21, Thanvi told how to use some magic to separate between two persons: “(Allah said:) ”We have put hatred and animosity between them until the day of Resurrection”<br /><br />If you desire to separate and put hatred between two persons, write this verse on a Bhuj stone, then write (the picture):<br /><br />And below the picture write the sentence: may the separation occur between Fulan (so and so) and Fulan. Write the names of the two persons instead of Fulan, make a Ta’wiz (Tameemah) of it and bury it between two old graves , but don’t do it for people not deserving this, as it will be a sin.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526722.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526722.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can clearly see that the picture Ashraf Ali Thanvi told to write contains the words “Sihr” meaning magic, and learning magic is Kufr. The heart of the Muslim cries and gets a shock to see that such a Kufr is propagated under the name of Islam and Quran. And in this book, Ashraf Ali Thanvi gave other Ta’wizat to cure from some disease or to have a boy and these Ta’wizat contain numbers and unknown words, and this is also clear magic.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526721.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526721.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526719.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526719.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to control the Humans and Jinns and possess the kingdom of Sulayman</span></strong><br /><br />The Deobandi book called “Jawahir Khamsah” is about Du’a, Ta’wizat and ‘Amaliyat. The author is Muhammad Ghawth Gulyari, and it has been translated from Persian by Mirza Muhammad Beg An-Naqshabani and it is published by famous Deobandi publisher of Karachi “Dar ul Isha’at”, and it is also published by another Deobandi publisher of Lahore “Maktabah Rehmaniyah”. At the end of this book, the Risalah “Futuh ul Ghayb” has been added.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301666627.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 666627.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In this book, the author teaches an invocation to possess the kingdom of Sulayman, control humans and Jinns: “Name 33 for greatness and control of humans and Jinns: “Ya Quddus Tahir min kuli Su fala Shayun Yu’azuhu min jami’ khalqihi” (O Quddus, pure from all evils, none can be protected in<br /><br />His whole creation). This composed name’s particularity is that whoever for Zahiri and Batini (apparent and interior) greatness, reads it ten thousands time fir forty days, will be cut from what is other than Allah, and all the creation including humans and Jinns will be under his control and obedience…and he will become the inheritor of the kingdom of Sulayman (aley salam)”…<br /><br />Also to possess the kingdom of Sulayman: whoever read this name for five years … (in a specific manner), he will have improvement in all of his works and the kingdom of Sulayman (aley salam) will come in his hands, and he will possess the control of the earth and the skies, and all the creation of the great and small universe will be under his control, and the whole universe will be enlightened by his benediction…even if he gives order, then the sun will appear in the night and disappear in the day”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671399.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671399.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can wonder is such things are possible then why did the Sahabah fought their enemies and some became martyrs? This kind of Tasawwud totally destroys the intelligence of its author, and they are totally lost in this world of hallucination and madness and accept any kind of fairy tale and nonsense. Allah created humans on pure Fitrah, but this wrong Sufism corrupted his Fitrah and made him accept such falsehood.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to the men of the invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb)</span></strong><br /><br />In the same book “Jawahir Khamsah” p 310 there is an invocation:<br />“Peace be upon you O men of the invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb) and noble souls, help us with your special help and look at us with your special looking, O Ruqaba, O Nuqaba, O Nujaba, O Bukhaba, O Abdal, O Awtad, O Aqtab, O Qutb al Aqtab help me in this matter…”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301666640.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 666640.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />About the invocation called ”Du’a Sayfi”, the author showed that it is finished with a table of numbers, and he does not know reality of it. So these people are writing numbers not knowing what they mean, they found this from Sufis.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301667637.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 667637.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />He also gave a circle of the men of invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb) which is at the end of this invocation:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301668325.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 668325.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And it has preceded that these people believe that these Awliya, Abdal and Qutb rule the world.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Writing Al-Fatihah in disorder</span></strong><br /><br />This book “Jawahir Khamsah” also tells to write Surah Al-Fatihah in disorder to cure from some diseases. And it is well known that this is pure magic and clear Kufr pleasing Jinns, as Shaykh ul Islam Ibn Taymiyah explained in his book “Furqan bayna Awliya Rahman wa Awliya Shaytan”.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301670464.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 670464.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Circles and crosses with strange words</span></strong><br /><br />This book also contains some pictures of crosses made with letters.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301670470.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 670470.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And there are strange circles with words like: Haqiqat Ism A’zam, Haqiqat Muhammad Haqiqi, ‘Alim Wahdat, ‘Alim Sifat, Arwah Maqam Haqiqat, Maqam Arwah.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669224.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669224.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669219.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669219.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There is also a circle containing 19 circles containing words such as: Soul (Ruh), secret (Sir), reason (‘Aql), imagination (Khyal), the heart (Qalb) and others.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669221.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669221.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And these terms are the Batini and Zahiri sense known to the Greek philosophers and used by Ibn Sina and then Sufis like Al-Ghazali and others.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Formula to kill someone</span></strong><br /><br />In “Futuh Ghayb” of Mirza Beg Naqshabandi published at the end of “Jawahir Khamsah” there is a formula telling us how to kill someone deserving death, not an innocent:<br /><br />“’Amal (Sufi formula) number ten: killing an enemy whose killing is permissible by the religious law. One should take and put a tree of Sanubar in an empty house, and he should write on it all the Great Names (of Allah) and if there is a group, then 48 times and if there are three then 27 times, and should do Dam (Ruqiyah) with the Great Names (of Allah) on the tree…and he should have no cloth on the head, and he should take a stick and imagine his<br />enemy then beat the Sanubar and say: “I have killed Fulan (so and so) with the domination of Allah (Jalla Jalaluhu)”. He should do such three or seven days.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671402.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671402.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can wonder if such things were correct why the Sahabah and Salaf fought and got martyred. But this kind of Sufism is an opium which totally destroys the reason of the person who enters it. This person might be attracted by the stories softening the heart, but then he is brain washed and accepts magic and all these fairy tales containing abominable Kufr and Shirk<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to have the attributes of Allah</span></strong><br /><br />In the same “Futuh Ghayb”, there is an invocation for the purpose of possessing the<br />attributes of Allah:<br /><br />“If someone wants to enter the state of Fana fi Allah and Baqa bi Allah, and wants to possess the attributes of Jamal and Jalal of Haqq (Allah), and great subsistence and honour…and Ilm Ladduni (Sufi secret knowledge) and Kashf (unveiling) of hidden lights, then he should first fulfill the conditions of this name…then he should do Ghusl in one of the beginning day of the month, sing one or two songs for the soul of the leader of Prophets (saw) and read hundred times Darood Sharif, then he should start reciting this<br />name 2695 times in the day and night for forty days…”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671400.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671400.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />May Allah protect us from such Kufr and Shirk.<br />May Allah send Salah and Salam on the Prophet (saw), his household, companions and those who follow them.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gift2deobandis.com/2013/05/20/the-creed-of-deobandi-elders-pdf/">https://gift2deobandis.com/2013/05/20/t ... lders-pdf/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Apr 13, 2017 11:41 pm</p><hr />
