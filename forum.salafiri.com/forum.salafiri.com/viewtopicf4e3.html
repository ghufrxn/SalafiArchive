				<h3>Books Recommended by Shaykh Muqbil for the Beginner (Student of Knowledge)</h3>

				<div class="content">Books Recommended by Shaykh Muqbil for the Beginner (Student of Knowledge)<br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong> Which books should a student of knowledge begin with? And then after those, if he wants to widen his study?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The books, which a student of knowledge, who is a beginner, should start reading with [if he can read and write well] are:<br /><br />1- Fath ul-Majeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed, which is a mighty book,<br />2- Aqeedat ul-Waasitiyyah by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah,<br />3- al-Qawl ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed by our brother Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee,<br />4- Bulugh al-Maraam<br />5- Riyaadh us-Saaliheen<br /><br />When you have read these books, you yourself will crave for more. If you could, start with the memorization of the Qur’aan, and this more good and desirable.<br /><br />As for the issue, regarding the ‘Arabic language, for our foreign brothers, then it is very important. If there is a foreign person who does not speak the ‘Arabic language well, then a person may come to him in his Islaamic appearance and then he begins to explain the Qur’aan to him other than how it ought to be, as happened with the Mu’tazilah.<br /><br />Taken From <strong>Tuhfatul Mujeeb ‘Alaa Asilatil-Hadhir wal-Ghareeb, p.156, Dar al-Aathar.</strong><br /><br />Shaykh Muqbil ibn Haadi al-Waad’iee<br /><br />Translated By: ‘Amr Basheer<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/15/booksmuqbil/" class="postlink">http://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/15/booksmuqbil/</a></div>
