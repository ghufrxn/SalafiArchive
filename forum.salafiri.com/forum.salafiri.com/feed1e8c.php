<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Ahl al-Hadith and Debates - Debating on Behalf of the Ulama of Najd]]></title>

The common neonatal reverberating claim of the Ahl al-Hadith always debating on Raf ul-Yadan or Fatihah has been oft repeated by those who have absolutely no idea of the dawah of the Ahl al-Hadith let alone their history. Hung up on their own shenanigans whilst desperately attempting to conceal their neo khariji beginnings, it is no wonder the modern renegades have hatred wrenched in animosity for the Dawah of Ahl al-Hadith and the Salafi manhaj<br /><br />When the Barelwi Mulla Na'im al-Din Muradabadi wrote a letter to King Ibn Sa'ud in 1926 challenging him for a debate and discussion on contentions issues pertaining to creedal issues and matters of belief. Ibn Sa'ud did not reply but rather the reply and defence came from Shaikh Thanullah Amritsari who replied to Na'im al-Din Muradabadi and said, <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">&quot;Dated October 1926<br /><br />For the perusal of Moulvi Na'im al-Din Sahib<br /><br />Assalamu Alaykum<br /><br />I read your letter to Jalalah al-Malak Ibn Sa'ud in the Siasat newspaper dated 30 September (1926) in which you requested the scholars of Najd to engage in a debate and theological discourse on contentious issues. So in answer I say, neither will the scholars of Najd come here and neither will you go there, therefore the easiest and best solution is for you to engage in a discourse and debate with us as the defenders and upholders of TAWHID AND SUNNAH on behalf of the Scholars of Najd, and we are available, ready and waiting. The discourse can take place in Delhi for convenience sake in the form of a written debate whilst you cite the topics of the debate before hand. Evidences and deductions will only be presented from the Quran and Ahadith with supporting statements from Imam Abu Hanifah.<br /><br />I hope you accept this suggestion and if you insist on the scholars of Najd then the people of intelligence will say (Persian Proverb) (&quot;They set their sights far and beyond when in reality they only wanted to make dead hollow noise&quot;)<br /><br />Thanullah&quot;</span></span></strong><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Taken from <br />the Daily Ahl al-Hadith Newspaper, Ahl al-Hadith Amritsar as dated.<br /><br />This shows the Manhaj of the Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith in defending Tawhid and the Sunnah approximately 90 years ago, contrary to the ignorance of the ignorant ones<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> â€” Fri Apr 21, 2017 12:29 am</p><hr />
