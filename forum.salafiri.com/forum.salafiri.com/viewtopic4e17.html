His mother was the granddaughter of Umar bin al-Khattab. He was born in 63 A.H. and passed away in the year 101A.H.<br /><br />Narrated by AbdulAzeez bin Yazeed al-‘Aylee who said : Sulaiman did Hajj &amp; Umar bin AbdulAzeez was with him, it started to thunder &amp; lightening struck so much that their hearts nearly came out, so Sulaiman said, Abu Hafs, have you ever seen a night like this or even heard of one like this? He answered: O Ameer al-Mumneen! This is the sound of the mercy of Allaah, so how would it be if you heard the sound of the punishment of Allaah! ?<br /><br />Al-‘Awza’ee said : Umar bin AbdulAzeez wrote a letter to us, no one memorized it except me and Makhool : ‘To proceed, indeed whoever remembers death a lot, then he is pleased with little in this world, and he who adds his speech in comparison to his action, then he lessens his speech except with that which will benefit him and as-salaam.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Sufyaan bin Saeed ath-Thawree (161 A.H.) was born in Koofah in a place called Thawr, his kunya is Abu Abdullaah, he narrated many ahadeeth and many scholars say that he was the Ameer ul Mumineen of hadeeth of his time. His father was also a great Muhaddith (Scholar of hadeeth).<br /><br />Abdullaah ibn Mubarak -Rahimullaah- said: ‘I wrote hadeeth from over 1,100 Shaykhs and I didn’t write from anyone better than Sufyaan.<br /><br />Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: The Angels are the guardians of the heavens &amp; the Companions of hadeeth (as-haabul hadeeth) are the guardians in the earth.<br /><br />Refer to Thahdheeb at thahdheeb by Ibn Hajar 2/56 &amp; Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubalaa by adh-Dhahabee 7/229.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Maalik ibn Anas -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Maalik ibn Anas ibn Aamir was born in Madeenah in 93 A.H. &amp; died in 179 A.H.

He was a Muhadith and a Faqih.<br /><br />He taught hadeeth in Madeenah for 40 years. He did not want his famous book al-Muwatta to become the only book that was relied upon.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak al-Hanzaalee at-Tameemee the great Imaam,<br /><br />AbdulAzeez bin Abee Rizma’ said : There’s no characteristic from the good characteristics except that it was combined in Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak, shyness, hospitality, good behaviour, a good companionship, it is good to sit with him, Zuhud and piety and in everything.<br /><br />He passed away -Rahimullaah- in 181 A.H.<br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Imaam Shaafiee -Rahimullaah</span></strong></em><br /><br />Imaam Shaafiee was born in 150 A.H. and grew up in Makkah.

Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- mentions that he had memorised the Qur’aan by the age 7 and memorised al-Muwatta by 10 years of age, and was giving legal verdicts from 15 years of age.<br /><br />His ancestry goes back to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- (his grandfather al-Muttalib was the brother of the grandfather of the Prophet.) At the age of 20 he began studying with Imaam Maalik in Madina until Imaam Maalik -Rahimullaah-passed away.<br /><br />Imaam Ahmad -Rahimullaah- was also his student. He died in 204 A.H. in old Cairo, due to injuries from being stabbed.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Yahya bin Ma’een -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Abu Zakariya, Yahya bin Ma’een bin ‘Awn al-Ghatfaanee.<br /><br />It is said that Yahya’s father left Yahya a million dirham in inhaeritance, and Yahya spent all of it in the field of Hadeeth until he did not have shoes to wear.<br /><br />He was the elder of his peers, from the likes of ‘Alee bin Madeenee, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaaq bin Rah’wayaa &amp; Abu Bakr bin Abee Shayba -Rahimhumullaah.<br /><br />A man came to Imaam Ahmad &amp; said : O Aba Abdillaah, look at these ahaadeeth indeed there is a mistake in them. So Imaam Ahmad said: Go to Abu Zakariya, for indeed he knows the mistake.<br /><br />Imaam Ahmad said about Yahya bin Ma’een: Here is a man that Allaah created for this matter, he exposes the lies of the liars.<br /><br />He died in the year 233 A.H.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abu Zura’h ar-Razee -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Abu Zura’h, UbaidAllaah bin ‘AbdulKareem bin Yazeed al-Qurashee ar-Razee.<br /><br />He started travelling for knowledge when he was 13 years of age, and on his second journey he was away for 14 yrs.<br /><br />Imaam adh-Dahabee said: He was unique of his time, in memory power, intelligence, and in the Deen, sincerity and knowledge and action.<br /><br />Yahya bin Manda said: It is said that Abu Huraira –Radi Allaahu anhu– had the most powerful memory from this Ummah, then it is Abu Zura’h ar-Razee.<br /><br />Abu Hatim said: If you saw ar-Razee and others hating Abu Zura’h then know that person is a mubtadi’.<br /><br />He passed away to the mercy of Allaah in 264 A.H.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Abu Hatim ar-Raazee -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Abu Hatim, Muhammad bin Idrees bin al-Mundhir al-Qhatfaanee ar-Raazee, who died in 277 A.H.<br /><br />He first started to memorize narrations when he was 14 years old, he was so knowledgeable that by just looking at the hadeeth he could give a judgement on it, whether it was authentic or not.<br /><br />Abu Hatim and Abu Zura’h were good friends.<br /><br />Imaam adh-Dahabee said: If Abu Hatim says someone is thiqa’ (trustworthy), then hold onto his saying, because he does not make anyone thiqa’ (trustworthy) except a narrator who has authentic hadeeth.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">an-Nisaa’ee -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Abu AbdurRahmaan Ahmad bin Shuaib bin ‘Alee al-Khurasaanee an-Nisaa’ee, who died in the year 303 A.H.<br /><br />It is said that the town from which an-Nisaa’ee came from, was named Nisa’ which means women, and the story behind it’s name is because when the Muslims came to conquer it during the earlier period of Islaam, the men were not present in the town, so the women came out to fight, when the Muslims saw that, they did not fight, because women are not fought against.<br /><br />Ibn Katheer mentions that Imaam an-Nisaa’ee was very beautiful and his face was like a candle.<br /><br />He started travelling for knowledge at a young age.

He used to call to the Sunnah with his speech and his writings; he used to warn against opposing it and was severe in his disapproval of Bida’.<br /><br />He wrote a very famous explanation of the Saheeh of al-Bukharee, called Fath-ul-Bari.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ash-Shawkanee -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />He is Muhammad bin ‘Alee ash-Shawkanee who died in the year 1250 A.H. he lived in Sana’, Yemen.<br /><br />He studied under his father who was a great scholar of Yemen, and he authored many books in the different sciences of Islaam, in Tafseer he wrote ‘Fathul-Qadeer’, &amp; in the field of hadeeth he wrote ‘Nail awtaar’.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Muhammad NaasirudDeen al-Albaanee -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad NaasirudDeen al-Albaanee he was born in Albania in the year 1332 A.H. into a poor family. His father and the family made Hijrah to Damascus.<br /><br />In Damascus Shaykh al-Albaanee completed his initial education and was then taught the Qur’aan, Tajweed, sciences of Arabic language, fiqh of the Hanafee madhab and further branches of the Deen by various Shaykhs and friends of his father.<br /><br />He also learnt from his father the art of clock and watch repair – and became highly skilled in that and famous for it and derived his earnings through it. He began to specialise in the field of Hadeeth and its related sciences by the age of 20- being influenced by articles in ‘al-Manaar’ magazine.<br /><br />Since he could not afford many of the books he required he would borrow them from the famous library of Damascus – “al-Maktabah adth Dthaahiriyyah” or sometimes from book sellers.<br /><br />He became engrossed with the science of Hadeeth to the extent that he would sometimes close up his shop and remain in the library for up to twelve hours – breaking off his work only for prayer – he would not even leave to eat, but would take two light snacks with him.<br /><br />Eventually the library authorities granted him a special room to himself for his study and his own key for access to the library before normal opening time. Often he would remain at work from early morning until after ‘Ishaa. During this time he produced many useful works – many of which are still waiting to be printed.<br /><br />The Shaykh faced much opposition in his efforts to promote Tawheed and the Sunnah but he bore this with patient perseverance. His works – mainly in the field of Hadeeth and its sciences number over 100.<br /><br />His students are many and include many Shaykhs of the present day amongst them:<br />Shaykh Hamdee ‘Abdul-Majeed, Shaykh Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee, Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zaynoo, Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Abdus-Samad.<br /><br />The Shaykh -Rahimullaah- passed away on Saturday 22 Jumaadaa ath-Thaaniyah 1420 A.H./2 October 1999. He was 87 years of age. May Allaah -subhaanahu wa ta’aala- have Mercy upon his soul, Aameen.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn Uthaimeen -Rahimullaah</span></strong><br /><br />He is Abu Abdillaah Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn Uthaimeen al-Wahabee at-Tameemee.<br /><br />Born in Unayzah, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 27th of Ramadan in the year 1347 hijree, he memorized the Qur’aan at a young age and he studied under the shaykh Abdur Rahmaan as-Sa’adee, he studied fiqh, grammar, hadeeth and tafseer.<br /><br />He also studied under the shaykh Abdul Azeez ibn Baaz.
