He died in 253H, al-Khallaal heard from him, and the isnaad is saheeh.<br /><br /><strong>Source:</strong> Adh-Dhahabi's &quot;Mukhtasar al-Uluww&quot; (p. 189)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Sat Dec 03, 2016 11:57 pm</p><hr />
