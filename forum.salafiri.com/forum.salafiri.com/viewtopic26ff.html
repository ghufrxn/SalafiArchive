The authors words indicate that the word Ar Rabb (the Lord) is derived from the word tarbiyah (to nurture), since he said: “Who has nurtured me and all of the creation with His favours and blessings.” So Allaah nurtures all of the creation with His favours, and He supported them with all of their needs. Allaah, the exalted and the Most High, said, concerning the conversation between Moosaa and Pharaoh,<br /><br /><ul><span style="color: #0000FF">So Pharaoh said: “O Moosaa, who is the Lord of you two?” He answered: “Our Lord is the One who provided a suitable mate for all the creatures He created, and then guided them to everything they need with regard to procreation, food, drink and habitation.”</span> [Soorah Taa Haa (20):49-50]</ul><br />So Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, are so many that they cannot be counted. Allaah, the Exalted and the Most High, says,<br /><br /><ul><span style="color: #0000FF">And if you were to try to count the blessings of Allaah, you would not be able to.</span> [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):34]</ul><br />So it is Allaah who created you, prepared you, supported you and provided for your needs, so He alone is deserving of your worship.</div>
