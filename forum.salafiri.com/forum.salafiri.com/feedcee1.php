<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Exalted are You, O Allaah<br /></span></strong><br /><strong>by Saad Burbank</strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﺩَﻋْﻮَﺍﻫُﻢْ ﻓِﻴﻬَﺎ ﺳُﺒْﺤَﺎﻧَﻚَ ﺍﻟﻠَّﻬُﻢَّ ﻭَﺗَﺤِﻴَّﺘُﻬُﻢْ ﻓِﻴﻬَﺎ ﺳَﻠَﺎﻡٌ ۚ ﻭَﺁﺧِﺮُ ﺩَﻋْﻮَﺍﻫُﻢْ ﺃَﻥِ ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺭَﺏِّ ﺍﻟْﻌَﺎﻟَﻤِﻴﻦَ</span></strong><br /><br />Their call therein will be, “Exalted are You, O Allah,” and their greeting therein will be ‘Salaam’ “Peace.” And the last of their call will be, “All Praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds!” [Soorah Yoonus 10: Verse 10]<br /><br />The Imaam, the memoriser, Abul-Fidaa Ismaa`eel Ibn Katheer (d. 774) rahimahullaah mentions in explanation of this verse:<br /><br />Ibn Jurayj said that His Saying: “Their saying ‘SubhaanakAllaahumma‘ “Glory be to You, O Allaah.”<br /><br />He said: “If a bird were to fly past them and they desired it they will say: ‘SubhaanakAllaahumma‘ “Glory be to You, O Allaah.” And that is their call.<br /><br />So an angel comes to them with that which they desire, so he gives them the greeting of salaam (peace); so they respond to him, due to His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﻭَﺗَﺤِﻴَّﺘُﻬُﻢْ ﻓِﻴﻬَﺎ ﺳَﻠَﺎﻡٌ</span></strong><br /><br />“And their greeting therein will be ‘Salaam’ “Peace.”<br /><br />So when they finish eating they praise their Lord, due to His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﻭَﺁﺧِﺮُ ﺩَﻋْﻮَﺍﻫُﻢْ ﺃَﻥِ ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺭَﺏِّ ﺍﻟْﻌَﺎﻟَﻤِﻴﻦ</span></strong><br /><br />And the last of their call will be, “All Praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds!”<br /><br />And Muqaatil bin Hayyaan said: “If the people of Paradise want to call for food, one of them says “SubhaanakAllaahumma.” ‘Exalted, Glory be to You O Allaah’.<br /><br />He said: So ten thousand servants attend to a single one of them, each servant having a platter made from gold, each platter having food not found on another platter.<br /><br />He said: “So they will eat from all of them.”<br /><br />And Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: If one of them wanted to call for something he says: “SubhaanakAllaahumma.” ‘Exalted, Glory be to You O Allaah’.<br /><br />And this verse is similar to His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">تَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُ سَلَامٌ</span></strong><br /><br />Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, ‘Salaam’ “Peace.” [33:44]<br /><br />And His saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">لَا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا تَأْثِيمًا إِلَّا قِيلًا سَلَامًا سَلَامًا</span></strong><br /><br />No ill speech will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (such as backbiting, etc.). But only the saying of: Salaam!, Salaam! (greetings of peace)! [56:25-26]<br /><br />And His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">سَلَامٌ قَوْلًا مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ</span></strong><br /><br />It will be said to them: Peace be upon you, a Word from The Lord, Most Merciful. [36:58]<br /><br />And His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُم</span></strong><br /><br />And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, saying: “Peace be upon you.” [13:23-24]<br /><br />As for His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﻭَﺁﺧِﺮُ ﺩَﻋْﻮَﺍﻫُﻢْ ﺃَﻥِ ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺭَﺏِّ ﺍﻟْﻌَﺎﻟَﻤِﻴﻦ</span></strong><br /><br />And the last of their call will be, “All Praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds!”<br /><br />In it is a proof that Allaah the Most High is the One Who is forever praised, and forever worshiped, and due to that He praised Himself for initiating the creation and for maintaining it, just as He praised Himself at the start of His book, and at the beginning of its revelation, when He – the Most High – said:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺍﻟَّﺬِﻱ ﺃَﻧﺰَﻝَ ﻋَﻠَﻰٰ ﻋَﺒْﺪِﻩِ ﺍﻟْﻜِﺘَﺎﺏَ</span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allah, Who sent down upon His Servant the Book. [18:1]<br /><br />And:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺍﻟَّﺬِﻱ ﺧَﻠَﻖَ ﺍﻟﺴَّﻤَﺎﻭَﺍﺕِ ﻭَﺍﻟْﺄَﺭْﺽَ</span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allaah, Who created the Heavens and the Earth. [6:1]<br /><br />And other than that from the verses – mention of which would be lengthy – so He is praised in the beginning and at the end, in this life, and in the Hereafter; in every circumstance.<br /><br />Due to this is has been narrated: “Indeed the people of Paradise will be caused to make tasbeeh (say “subhaanAllaah”, Exalted is Allaah) and tahmeed (say “Alhamdulillaah”, all praise is for Allaah) just as they will be caused to breathe.” [Muslim no. 2835]<br /><br />They will be like this due to what they see from Allaah’s multiplied blessings upon them, these blessings will be repeated for them, and returned to them again and again, increasing limitlessly. They will never come to an end, nor have a fixed duration.<br /><br />So there is no diety that has the right to be worshiped except Him, and no Lord other than Him.<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/08/22/99/</strong><br /><br />Share this:<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Sep 01, 2016 11:04 am</p><hr />
