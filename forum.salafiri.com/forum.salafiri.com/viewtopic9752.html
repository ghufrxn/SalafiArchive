				<h3>Tahir ul-Qadiri Lying About The Grading of the Hadith of Wasilah – Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai [1435H]</h3>

				<div class="content">QUESTION<br /><br />A narration mentions that Adam (Alayhis Salam) supplicated through the Wasilah of Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). (al-Mustadrak al-Hakim 2/615 no.4228, Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489 of Baihaqi).<br /><br />After citing this narration Dr Tahir ul-Qadiri (Barailwi) wrote,<br /><br />“Imam Hakim graded this Hadeeth to have an authentic (Saheeh) chain. Imam Baihaqi also graded it Sahih” (al-Arba’een Fee Fadhail an-Nabi al-Amin pg.55, 4th Edn 2002)<br /><br />So did Imam Baihaqi really authenticate and grade this narration to be Sahih and is this narration actually Sahih. Abu Saqib Muhammad Safdar of Hazro.<br /><br />ANSWER<br />We say Imam Baihaqi did not grade this narration to be authentic (Sahih) at all, rather Imam Baihaqi, May Allaah have mercy on him said, “This is a lone report from Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and he is weak.” (Dalail an-Nabuwwah 5/489).<br /><br />Similarly Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri also cites this report in another book and thereafter reports Imam Baihaqi and others as grading it to be Sahih. (Refer to his book Aqidah Tawhid Aur Haqiqat Shirk pg. 266, 5th Edn, June 2005)<br /><br />So Mr Tahir ul-Qadiri saying that Imam Baihaqi graded it to be authentic (Sahih) is a clear and manifest lie.<br /><br />NOTE<br />Imam Hakim was corrected by Hafidh Dhahabi in Talkhis al-Mustadrak and said, “Rather infact it is fabricated (Mawdoo).”<br /><br />The chain of this narration is Mawdoo ie fabricated due to Abdur Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam and Abdullah bin Muslim al-Fahri. For further details refer to Silsilah al-Hadith ad-Da’ifah Wal-Mawdoo’ah (1/38,47 no.25) of Shaikh al-Albani, May Allah have mercy on him.<br /><br />(Fatawa Ilmiyyah ie Tawdhih al-Ahkam (1/84-85 Monthly al-Hadith Magazine, Issue 22, both of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/tahir-ul-qadiri-lying-about-the-grading-of-the-hadith-of-wasilah-shaikh-zubair-ali-zai-1435h/">http://www.salafiri.com/tahir-ul-qadiri ... zai-1435h/</a><!-- m --></div>
