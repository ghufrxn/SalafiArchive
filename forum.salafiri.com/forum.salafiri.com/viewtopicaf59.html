But sometimes I am afflicted with fear about the future as it pertains to provision and means of living, for me and for my children, especially in recent times. This has caused me worry, sadness and confusion. What is your guidance for me regarding these things?</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh responded:</span></strong><br /><br />This is from Shayṭān, you must seek refuge with Allāh from this, if you feel this, you seek refuge with Allāh from this, and have a good opinion of Allāh, and rely on Him (by entrusting your affairs to Him). Allāh will make things easy as He wills.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Original (Arabic) audio</span>: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=148310">http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=148310</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://owaisalhashimi.info/al-fawzan-on-worrying-about-future-provision-and-means-of-living/">https://owaisalhashimi.info/al-fawzan-o ... of-living/</a><!-- m --></div>
