<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Raaqi Is A Mujaahid Fighting In the Way Of Allah</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Taymiyyah (Rahimahullah) said,<br /><br />&quot;For the Exorcist [the Raaqi] such a person is a soldier of Allah, he is a Mujaahid for the sake of Allah, and this is from the greatest forms of Jihad, so he should be careful, lest the enemy overcome him by his sins. If the circumstances is beyond his capacity, he should remember that 'Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.' He should not expose himself to tribulation by taking on what he is unable to handle&quot; [1]<br /><br />He also said, &quot;It is not right that someone is scared of learning this knowledge [of Ruqyah] and practising it, because it is an act of worship, and jihad for the sake of Allah, the Exalted. The servants of Allah who stick to his limits are within the safekeeping of Allah, his protection, his care, and his preservation.&quot; In explaining this, he said, &quot;The Prophets and the pious people who followed them fought against the enemies of Allah, from the jinn and the men, and they repelled them with whatever permissible means that they were able, and they would remove the jinn from the bodies of people, as 'Eesa and our Messenger Muhammad (May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both) did.&quot; The purpose of jihad is to make the word of the Allah the highest, and the word of those who disbelieve the lowest. The Raaqi is the one who puts himself in danger, fighting against the Shayateen to achieve this aim.<br /><br /><em>Al Majmoo al Fataawa Ibn Taymeeyah.</em><br />[1] Ibn Taymiyyah's Essay on the Jinn, pp 69-72.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> â€” Sat Mar 25, 2017 3:57 pm</p><hr />
