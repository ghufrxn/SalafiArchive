Shaykh Saleh al Fawzaan on those who use the term “Jaamiyah” on Ahlus Sunnah<br /><br />Shaikh Allamah Fawzan severely censuring those who mock Ahlus Sunnah with the name Jamiyyah which is an ascription to Shaikh Allamah Muhammad Aman al-Jami and is used on the Salafis in an attempt to mock and discredit them, the Shaikh hafidhahullah equates them to the Neo munafiqs. It is not far to also impose this on those who use the word madkhali, madkhalis or madakhilah as the intent is the same. This is done to oppose a fervour of a methodology in attempting to keep Salafiyyah pristine and Allaah knows best.<br /><br /><center> <strong>iframe</strong> </center><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br />Eminent Shaykh, this question says: What is your view regarding the one who says that (the concept of) hearing and obeying the leader is Jaamee terminology; and who are the Jaamees?<br />.<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (hafidhahullah):</span></strong> <br />.<br />Who is the one who said:<br /><em>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those who are in authority amongst you.” [Surat An-Nisa 4:59]</em><br />.<br />Who is the one who said this; Al-Jaamee? Allaah, the Glorified and High, said it.<br />.<br />Who is the one who said:<br /><em>“It is upon you to have Taqwaa of Allaah, and to hear and obey; even if a slave is appointed to lead over you.” [Tirimidhi]</em><br />.<br />Did Al-Jaamee say it? Or did this sinful hypocrite say it? We ask Allaah for security. That which is important is that you should not pay attention to these affairs.<br />.<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Questioner:</span></strong> However, they always say that this is the Manhaj of the Jaamees; is there a Jamaa’ah called the Jaamees?<br />.<br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh:</span></strong> They are the ones who contrived this name. This is not except like when they said “Wahaabees;” are there some Wahhaabees who depart from that which the Salaf of this Ummah and its Imaams were upon? These are names which they use to chase (people) away from the Truth; names which they use to chase (people) away from the Truth. They should be paid no mind.<br /><br /><strong>Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts<br />النبز بالجامية ودعوى المنافقين جديد الشيخ صالح الفوزان 1435/6/24 هجري</strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jan 30, 2017 12:42 am</p><hr />
