The Mawlid Papers – Part 35 – Part C – Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (728H) Demolishing the Bid’ah of Mawlid – What did he really say!!!<br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br />Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<br /><br />Some people attribute the following to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah<br /><br />“This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya’s opinion about Mawlid from: “the Collected Fatwas,” (“Majma’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,”) Vol. 23, p. 163: <br /><br />“fa-t’adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf’alahu ba’ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t’adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam” <br /><br />“To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).”<br /><br />we already mentioned in a previous paper Part 33 SEE HERE that Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, a sufi misguider from America cites half of the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah in his Encyclopaedia of Islamic doctrine (3:15) wherein he mentions the words of the great reward aspect only whilst having distorted Ibn Taymiyyahs words to show the readers that he approved the mawlid. A number of other sufi writers and mawlid proponents have reproduced these words of Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah in their various treatises.<br /><br />Other scholars like the former grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Al-al-Shaikh dismissed such statements allegedly supporting statements of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah for the mawlid, more so its relevance because of the sheer overwhelming number of statements and clear ruling against the mawlid and declaring it to be an innovation from Imam Ibn Taymiyyah himself. (Rasai'il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi (1:45)<br /><br />Shaikh Isma'il al-Ansari also answered such false aspersions on the position of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah and he also criticised the sufi, Muhammad Alawi Maliki who had cited the same words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah whilst distorting them. Shaikh Ismail al-Ansari answers such points in his specific and detailed treatise on this issue titled, al-Qawl al-Fasl Fi Hukm al-Tawassul Bi Khayr al-Rusul. (See Rasai'il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi (2:391-884)<br /><br />The Egyptian Salafi scholar Shaikh Muhammad Hamid Fiqi answers this point and says how can such people receive reward when they oppose the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah and the way of the companions. He goes onto say if they argue they reached this conclusion through their independent reasoning i.e. ijtihad but they made a mistake then what kind of ijtihad is this in that it opposes the conclusive and established texts of ibadah and thus it falls outside the remit of ijtihad. (See his notes to the Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (p.294-296), see also Rasai'il Fi Hukm al-Ihtifal Bi al-Mawlid al-Nabawi (1:220-223)<br /><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah very clearly himself ruled the mawlid to be a reprehensible i.e. makruh innovation because the Salaf us-Saleh did not celebrate it. (Majmu’a al-Fatawa (1:36)<br /><br />Shaykh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was asked can a person recite the whole of the Quran in honour of the Prophets birthday? Instead of giving a straight yes or no answer, he expands on the discusison and deals with all of the innovated festivals or Eids. he said.<br /><br />&quot;The gathering of the people for food during the two eids is a normal sunnah as they are the rites of Islam which the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) set for the muslims and by caring for the poor by feeding them during Ramadan is a a sunnah of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) said whoever feeds the fasting person will receive a similar reward to him.&quot; Also helping the poor recitors of the Quran is a virtuous act at any time and therefore whoever supports them shares the reward. And as for the establishment of a seasonal festival (mawsim) that is not among the lawful i.e. shari'ah festivals such as one of the nights of Rabi al-Awwal, which is said to be the night of the mawlid or one of the nights of Rajab or the 18th of of Dhul Hijjah of the first friday prayer of Rajab or the eighth of Shawwal which the ignorant call the festival of the righteous ones i.e. Eid al-Abrar, THESE ARE AMONG THE INNOVATIONS - BID'AH THAT THE SALAF US-SALEH DID NOT RECOMMEND NOR DID THEY PRACTISE and Allah the mighty and exalted knows best.&quot; (Majmu'a al-Fatawa (1:312)<br /><br />The avid reader is referred to the monumental book which has been oft quoted in these papers, namely Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim wherein Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah deals with the innovated festivals and Eids in great detail and lays the foundations and principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama'ah. A lot of content can be added to the understanding of the mawlid from the words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah which would be beyond the simplicity of these papers.<br /><br />However, before we conclude the series on Imam Ibn Taymiyyah on the mawlid and how the Sufiyyah have miserably failed to show Ibn Taymiyyah approved the mawlid, let us show the Sufi Barelwi and the global Sufiyyah that they are very quick to quote Ibn Taymiyyah to us, so we ask what they make of Muhammad Alawi Maliki arguing that special gatherings of the Prophets Birthday are lawful because it is understood to be a custom and not worship and not ibadah. Muhammad Alawi Maliki furthers his argument and says if the mawlid was considered a special day of worship it would be an unlawful i.e. haram bid'ah  (see his Hawl al-Ihtifal Bil Mawlid al-Nabawi al-Sharif (p.12) and Mafahim Yajib An Tusahhaha (p.224-226)<br /><br />The first point is a very poor deduction and a clever ploy to dodge the ruling of innovation and an attempt to hide under the cloak of adat i.e. custom. This is a false notion because an adat or custom is something that has always been practised by the Muslims and or the custom of a group of muslims from different lands and this is limited in number because if all of the Muslims began to do this, it no longer remains a custom. Secondly customs are only accepted if they do not oppose the texts of Islam as any custom which opposes the clear guidance from the Quran and Sunnah is rejected. <br /><br />One only needs to ask the participants of the mawlid gatherings to see how much Islam they have within them and how the pristine shari'ah is violated. To say the mawlid is a muslim custom is the most powerful stretch of the imagination because there is no reward in a custom so then why do it and if it is a custom as wishfully claimed, then why is it called an Eid, surely this is highly contradictory and a case of polemics???<br /><br />As for Muhammad Alawi Maliki's second point, then we find the mawlid sympathisers do consider the mawlid to be a special day, wherein special gatherings are organised, food is made, lights adorn the houses and special events and processions are organised around the globe. This clearly shows they do consider the mawlid to be a special day of worship and they do single out  special day i.e. the 12th of Rabi al-Awwal. Therefore according to their own scholar, Muhammad Alawi Maliki the Sufi Barelwis are committing an unlawful innovation i.e. a haram bid'ah.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Dec 22, 2016 12:58 am</p><hr />

The Mawlid Papers – Part 34 – Part B – Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (728H) Demolishing the Bid’ah of Mawlid – What did he really say!!!<br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<br /><br /><br />Some people attribute the following to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah<br /><br />“This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya’s opinion about Mawlid from: “the Collected Fatwas,” (“Majma’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,”) Vol. 23, p. 163: <br /><br />“fa-t’adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf’alahu ba’ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t’adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam” <br /><br />“To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).”<br /><br /><br />Even the beginning ardent supporter of the Mawlid knows who Shaikh al-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah was and his firm positions on innovations and their destructive affects. They find literally one sentence from his magnitude of works and say he supported the Mawlid!!! Sometimes even shame is ashamed of the antics of these people.<br /><br />It is known that Imam Ibn Taymiyyah vehemently repelled and subdued innovations and the innovators and his students like Imam al-Bazzar and Imam Ibn Abdul Hadi amongst others all testified to Imam Ibn Taymiyyah's unparalleled efforts in refuting innovations. (al-Uqud al-Durriyyah Min Manaqib Shaikh ul-Islam Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah (p.2) al-A'lam al-Aliyyah Fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiyyah (p.33), Kawakaib al-Duriyyah Fi Manaqib al-Mujtahid Ibn Taymiyyah (p.52)<br /><br />It is contradictory for Imam Ibn Taymiyyah to say what the opponents allege because he defines innovations very clearly, he said they are things which are not prescribed in the Din of Allah. (Majmu'a al-Fatawa (31:36). Therefore how can there be a great reward for doing something that is a bid'ah i.e. not prescribed in the Din of Allah.<br /><br />He also very clearly mentions the views and positions of the scholars or leaders that occur in different places whether minority or a majority cannot be used whatsoever as evidence to justify innovations. This is also therefore an answer to the simple beguiled Muslims who sympathize with the Barelwi Sufi's doctrine due to their cultural background and link with what they have been custom to without looking at the intrinsic arguments. (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:584)<br /><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah further expounds on the understanding of the Mawlid sympathisers and explains that most of the innovations which have been introduced and formulated by leaders and scholars, have been done so by the aforementioned categories of people thinking they are good and something beneficial. The Mawlid is therefore a classical example of something innovated to build and establish acts for community cohesion and for other reasons which range from socio-political reasons and for popular supports etc. (Majmu'a al-Fatawa (11:345), Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:594)<br /><br />We known from the previous Mawlid Paper 33 SEE HERE Imam Ibn Taymiyyah classified the Mawlid as an innovation and when he said, &quot;they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad&quot; (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:619) he explains this and says a scholar will be excused if he erred by exercising independent ijtihad and he may even be rewarded for his efforts but this does not mean the people make taqlid of such a scholar because his ruling and reasoning may be flawed, incorrect and inaccurate. <br /><br />When this is the case it cannot be argued that such innovations or practices are something praiseworthy or even carry any reward or a great reward for that matter because Imam Ibn Taymiyyah clearly said and argues himself that if any action is considered to be good there must be divine text in support of the action or practise. If there is a textual evidence for any action say for instance the Mawlid then it will be considered a permissible action according to the shari'ah and not a good innovation i.e. bid'ah hasanah as some of the proponents of the Mawlid claim regarding the mawlid. (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:584)<br /><br />They claim and acknowledge the mawlid was never practiced in the first three generations and it is only the extreme ignorant ones who try to prove the mawlid by distorting the texts or using unrelated, non specific and general evidences such as the Barelwi Sufi's spread across the Sufi Tariqahs. Thus, the intellectual prodigies amongst them argue the mawlid is therefore a good bid'ah. <br /><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah also clarified that many scholars or individuals introduced innovations with the sole intention to corrupt and to taint the Shari'ah and when this is his understanding it would be contradictory for him to say there is a great reward for the one who practices the mawlid.

The Mawlid Papers – Part 33 – Part A - Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (728H) Demolishing the Bid'ah of Mawlid - What did he really say!!!<br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<br /><br />The people of innovation and the ardent proponents of Mawlid al-Nabi often mention in support of their view a statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah which they firstly take out of context and secondly misquote by only citing the beginning of the statement. It is very strange and odd that these people quote and present the statement of Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah for the mawlid when they spend night and day declaring him to a heretic and an anthropomorphist. If they say they have only quoted Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as an evidence against the Salafi's and the Ahl al-Hadith, then this yet again is another serious contradiction and shows the people of innovation do not have sound intelligence.<br /><br />On one hand they call us la-madhahabiyyah or ghair muqallids and then at the same time they quote our scholars to us as evidence. Without digressing from the issue at hand, why would the statement of a scholar be a hujjah for the very same people you call ghair muqallids. This is nonsensical and a clear proof the people of shirk and bid'ah have the most incongruous of intellects.<br /><br />The Sufis have done the rounds with a statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah with a failed attempt to support the Mawlid. Mr Sufi himself; Hisham Kabbani pushed this statement around and his cohorts solidified it amongst their fellow sufi brethren. They refer to the statement of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah where he said,<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;This is Imam Ibn Taymiyya's opinion about Mawlid from: &quot;the Collected Fatwas,&quot; (&quot;Majma' Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya,&quot;) Vol. 23, p. 163:<br /><br />&quot;fa-t'adheem al-Mawlid wat-tikhaadhuhu mawsiman qad yaf'alahu ba'ad an-naasi wa yakunu lahu feehi ajra `adheem lihusni qasdihi t'adheemihi li-Rasulillahi, salla-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam&quot; <br /><br />&quot;To celebrate and to honor the birth of the Prophet (s) and to take it as an honored season, as some of the people are doing, is good and in it there is a great reward, because of their good intentions in honoring the Prophet (s).&quot;<br /></span><br />Some of them even reproduce the following from Imam Ibn Taymiyyah,<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">“And similarly what some people innovate by analogy with the Christians who celebrate the birth of ‘Eesa (Jesus), or out of love for the Prophet (saw) and to exalt him, and may Allaah reward them for this love and effort, not on the fact that it is an innovation…” (Majmu’a al-Fatawa, Vol.23 p.163, Iqtida’ al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p.294-295, Section entitled, 'The innovated festivals of time and place.')</span><br /><br />However, this is a false interpretation and representation of his words which is not surprising to say the least, as one would only be surprised if they were accurate and precise for once in quoting Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said in his monumental book, Iqtidaa' al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim 'Following the Straight Path in Opposing the People of the Hell-Fire'<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=105" class="postimage" alt="d2978619-dbe0-4b5c-b173-2d5ae11e4e60.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=106" class="postimage" alt="9dfdd37a-a11d-4267-93a2-dfd6734e58ae.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=107" class="postimage" alt="9778c881-46ce-4823-bcea-61077f654da8.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=108" class="postimage" alt="27db3954-56b9-4b82-8713-516a5d86efe9.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">“And like that, what some people have innovated, be it out of analogy to the Christians in the birth of ‘Eesa or be it out of love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and honor for him and Allah, they may be rewarded for this love and ijtihaad, not for the innovation as an ‘Eid. Along with the difference between the people with regards to his birth, this (celebration) was not done by the early generations of pious scholars even though factors that would have necessitating [the Mawlid] were present and there was a lack of any factors that would prevent them from doing so if it had indeed been good.<br /><br />If this [the Mawlid] was genuinely good or the correct opinion then the pious scholars of the early generations (may Allaah be pleased with them) would have been more entitled to it than us. They had greater love for the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and were more honouring of him than us; they were more eager upon goodness.<br /><br />Indeed, from the perfection of loving and honouring him is in following him, being obedient to him, following his command, reviving his Sunnah both in secrecy and open, spreading that which he was sent with, striving regarding that with one’s heart, hand and tongue. For indeed this is the path of the first of the early generations [who accepted his message] from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar, and those that followed them in goodness.<br /><br />Most of them who you find eager upon such innovations (Bid’ah) despite their good intention and striving – for these two things reward is hoped (i.e. their good intention and striving) – however you find them weak in following the command of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) in that which they were commanded to be energetic and enthusiastic. They are like a person who adorns the Mushaf (a copy of the Qur’an) yet does not read what is in it; or they are like somebody who reads [what is in the Qur’an] but never follows it; or somebody who adorns the Masjid yet does not pray in it or only prays a little in it; or like a person who takes extravagant prayer beads and mats. Such apparent adornments which have not been legislated and are accompanied with showing off, pride and being pre-occupied away from what is actually legislated – this all corrupts the state of the person who is like this.<br /><br />Know that from the actions are those that have some good in them, due to including types of legislated actions and also they include evil such as innovations and other than that. So this action would be good due to what it includes of good and [at the same time] evil due to what it contains of turning away from the religion in its entirety – such is the state of the hypocrites and disobedient people. This is what most of the Ummah has been afflicted by in the later times…&quot; [Translated by Abul Abbaas Naveed Ayaaz]</span><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Iqtidaa' al-Sirat al-Mustaqim li Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (2:619-620) with the checking of Shaykh Nasir al-Aql, Maktabah al-Rushd 1417/1996,5th edn)<br /><br />Various translations of the above have been reproduced by a number of brothers with their annotations and essentially it all leads to an undisputed point; that the mawlid is a clear innovation and Imam Ibn Taymiyyah declared it to be an unequivocal innovation. He clearly says as the scans show that the individual may be rewarded for his love and ijtihad. <br /><br />There is a stark difference between what Imam Ibn Taymiyyah actually said and how the Sufi's and Barelwis have presented this point. Let us also remind the reader the disastrous translations and the deliberate treacherous distortion of the crystal clear words of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah. The Sufi's and Barelwis should at least know venerating and respecting the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam); the best of mankind is a fundamental and intricate part of the belief system of Ahl al-Sunnah.<br /><br />To be continued......<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2016 12:35 am</p><hr />

Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />Shaikh Muhammad Abdullah Ghazipuri was born in 1260/1844 in Mau in Northern India. He studied with numerous Scholars. He was under the tutelage of the Indian Hadith Master, Shaikh Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Delhi (1320H) who he also received Ijazah from and was considered to be from amongst his most notable students. He also gained ijazah in hadith from Shaikh Abbas bin and al-Rahman al-Yamani in 1297H, who was the direct student of Imam Shawkani. He died in 1337/1918 in Lucknow. (Nazhah al-Khawatir 8:305-307, Tarajim Ulama al-Hadith  (p.459)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Question</strong>: Are mawlid gatherings permissible or impermissible?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> It is impermissible to organise and participate in mawlid gatherings because the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam did not himself organise such mawlid gatherings during his time and neither did he instruct his Ummah to do likewise. The companions also did not organise or participate in such mawlid gatherings during his time. Furthermore, what is the legal status of such gatherings? Prophethood finished with the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam and thus its legislation also finished with his prophethood, therefore how can these mawlid gatherings be permissible.<br /><br />Hidayah mentions it is makruh i.e. prohibitively disliked to pray optional prayers other than the Sunnah prayers after Fajr and the reason cited for this is that the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) despite being keen to offer prayers would not extend beyond the legislated number of rakahs (Hidayah 1:82)<br /><br />Hidayah further mentions that one should not pray any optional prayers before the Eid prayer at the Musallah and the reason for this despite the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) being keen to offer prayer never prayed any optional prayers before the Eid prayer. (Hidayah 1:155)<br /><br />Written by<br /><br />Muhammad Abdullah 13th Rabi al-Awwal 1331H<br /><br />Majmu'a Fatawa Ustadh al-Ustadhah Muhammad Abdullah Ghazipuri (d.1337H) (pp.45-46)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Dec 15, 2016 10:58 pm</p><hr />

The Mawlid Papers – Part 31 - The Legal Status of Mawlid Gatherings - Imam Nazir Hussain Muhaddith Dehlawi (1320H) &amp; Shaikh Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri (1353H)<br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />Question: What do you say about the Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times? Are they permissible or impermissible?<br /><br />Answer: The Mawlid gatherings that are organised in our times are an innovation and it is not but except a bitter bid'ah. The gatherings that are organised are newly invented matters and every newly invented matter is an innovation. As for it being minor innovation then it is that such  gatherings did not exist during the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallams time, nor during the times of the companions, the successors or during the time of the Imams of Ijtihad, May Allah be pleased with them all.  Likewise and similarly such Mawlid gatherings are a hub and a concoction of evil and open corruption and its permissibility cannot be deduced from the Book of Allah nor from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam nor from Ijma or correct Qiyas and therefore it (these Mawlid gatherings) are are newly invented matters.<br /><br />As for it being a major innovation then the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam said, &quot;Beware of newly invented matters for verily every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.&quot; (Abu Dawud no.4607, Tirmidhi no.2676, Ibn Majah no.46, Ahmad 4:126,Mishkat 1:36)<br /><br />He also said, &quot;The worst of the affairs are the newly invented matters and every innovation is misguidance.&quot; (Muslim no.867)<br /><br />The Scholars of Ahl al-Hadith have authored numerous works and treatises on the Mawlid gatherings and in warning and censuring against it. The avid reader who wishes to read amore about this issue may refer to them and Allah knows best.&quot;<br /><br />Sayyid Muhammad Nazir Hussain<br /><br />Written by Muhammad Abdur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri<br /><br />(Fatawa Nazariyyah (1:221), Majmu'a Fatawa Abdur Rahman Mubarakpuri (pp.88-89)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2016 11:01 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">The Mawlid Papers – Part 29 – The History and Origins of the Mawlid and Milād Celebrations – Analysing Neşet Çaǧatay’s Paper ‘The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey’</span></span></strong><br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br /><br /><br />Neşet Çaǧatay goes on to mention how the Mawlid was part of intricate Turkish life and how they would label the month of Rabi al-Awwal as the Month of Mawlid. She also mentions such Mawlid recitations were rich with Turkish heritage which were part pf the dailies lived and beliefs of the Turks.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=101" class="postimage" alt="anatolia1.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=102" class="postimage" alt="anatolia2.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.130-131 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />She also mentions an interesting point; that the Mawlid eulogies, from the first ones in the Turkish language were composed of verses and prose text. The style they were composed in suggested the rhyming would lead to chanting rather than recitation. This again is a reprimand on the Sufi’s, especially the Barelwis, who often thoughtlessly like to argue and say what is wrong in such recitations when the reality and fact of the matter is that such Mawlid recitations were designed to be chanted in unison which is unlegislated in the Shari’ah.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=103" class="postimage" alt="siyer nebwi3.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.131 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />Neşet Çaǧatay then explains the history of the origins of the Turkish Mawlid and how the Ottomans played a pivotal role in the spread of the Mawlid and the associated celebrations and festivities. She explains how the Mawlid (eulogy of praise) of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) was authored in the beginning of the 9th century Hijri / 15th century Gregorian. They began to recite the Mawlid poems in the Palaces of the Ottomans and the part the Ottoman rulers played in the spread of the Mawlid.<br /><br />She also goes onto show how the Ottoman rulers ordered for Minarets and houses to be illuminated with lights and so on and so forth. [Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.131 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=104" class="postimage" alt="kadi-darir4.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br />This is exactly the same in our era and in current times. You will see the houses of these people ornate with bright flashing green lights or lights that’s cover the whole house which are often green or in the shape of a sandals.<br /><br />This was a brief reading and discussion on the Mawlid having Turkish Pre-Islamic origins which the Sufi and Barelwi’s have adopted as part of their Religion.  Neşet Çaǧatay in great detail, methodically and systematically goes through the history of the Mawlid and shows its Turkish roots and also shows how the celebrations and festive gatherings evolved as we see today in Europe.<br /><br />The similarities are strikingly similar, in fact there is hardly any difference in these practices which have nothing to do with the Quran and Sunnah or the practise of the Salaf al-Saleh ie the pious predecessors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Fri Dec 09, 2016 11:34 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">The Mawlid Papers – Part 28 – The History and Origins of the Mawlid and Milād Celebrations – Analysing Neşet Çaǧatay’s Paper ‘The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey’</span></span></strong><br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />Muzaffar al-Dīn would get up such acts ranging from engaging and promoting music and musical instruments, gathering Qawalī gatherings, dancing, oppressing his people etc. The Milād gatherings were organised under such pretences and under such anti-Islamic atmosphere. These gatherings also commonly known as Mehfils were not based on anything from the Qurān or Sunnah but rather everything that was organised was totally contradictory.<br /><br />Muzaffar al-Din inadvertently advocated and pushed the ideas of Wahdah ul-Adyān ie the unification of religions. He attempted to push the concept of syncretism ie synchronising the different religions as well as pre Islamic practices.<br /><br />According to Neşet Çaǧatay, she argues and says the origins and roots of Milād are Pre Islamic of Turkish persuasion and custom, which have been essentially modified over the centuries to take on an Islamic appearance. She says<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=98" class="postimage" alt="turkish-religion1.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />This clearly shows how pre Islamic Turkish custom and practices were utilised introduced with other innovations to be something praiseworthy and rewarding, however they are pure innovations.<br /><br />In current times the Mawlid or Milād celebrations have become more heretical with the extravagant lighting, the music and dancing which is very much open without any shame of the vulgarity. This is evident from some of the videos on youtube.<br /><br />Again we find this is nothing new, although Neşet Çaǧatay makes some assertions, not all of them are entirely correct or on point in fact they are just emotions and personal opinions. Nonetheless she asserts,<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=99" class="postimage" alt="mevlevi2.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.130 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī was also instrumental in pushing the idea of the Mawlid. He was famous poet and Sūfi Master who was the Sūfī patron of the Melviyyah (Mawlawi) who often referred to as the whirling dervishes. They believed in making zikr and dancing at the same time which is known as Sama in Sūfī terminology.<br /><br />The Melviyyah would whirl continuously and lose their minds in an abstruse trance in an attempt to achieve unison and unity with Allāh which is again known as Wahdah ul-Wajūd in Sūfī terminology. This shows the Sūfī’s, especially the whirling dervishes known as the Melviyyah (Mawlawiyyah) and their head, Maulāna Jalāl al-Dīn al-Rūmī were instrumental in shaping the Mawlid we see today,<br /><br />Thus, during the Mawlid or Milād season, you will find heavy involvement of music, clapping of the hands to create sounds and rhythmic beats, drums and tambourines. In other parts of the world professional singers and musicians are hired for the festive to play religious esoteric trance type of music, commonly known as Qawalis.<br /><br />Most of the ardent and staunch supporters of the Mawlid hail from the sub continent and whilst settling in the western world, they have progress and evolved in such an alarming rate that they forced us to produce more Mawlid papers.<br /><br />Highlighting the regression of these people, in the western world Eid Milād al-Nabī was unheard of. There were no lights, no processions and no such gatherings. Such practices were unheard until recently in the last 5-10 years. This yet again is another outright evidence and reality that Mawlid and Milād celebrations are clear innovations.<br /><br />The Ottomans further spread the Mawlid during their reign and further designated specific customs and practices. Neşet Çaǧatay highlights in the following words<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=100" class="postimage" alt="Kadi Darir3.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.130 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Fri Dec 09, 2016 1:30 am</p><hr />

The Shīʿtes also have their own ideas and concepts of Milād, which they celebrate, in fact there is not much difference between how the Barilwī’s, Sufī’s and Shīʿtes celebrate the Milād, two faces of the same coin. She says under the heading of the history of the recitations of Mawlid,<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=94" class="postimage" alt="Shiite Fatimids1.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.128 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />Neşet Çaǧatay goes on to say,<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=95" class="postimage" alt="Gokboru2.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />The historian Ibn Khalkān also enforces this view, he gives a firsthand account of what used to really happen at a Mawlid gathering in his Wafyāt, which will be cited later.<br /><br />Yāqūt al-Hamawī said,<br /><br />“He would seriously oppress his people and subjugate them, he would always be inclined to forcefully take their wealth without reason. Similarly he would also feed the poor and destitute and offer them charity. He would also spend a lot of money to free those enslaved by the disbelievers.” [Muʿajam al-Buldān [1:138]<br /><br />Muʿjam al-Buldān goes on to mention a couplet of a poet where he says, he was similar to the prostitute woman who gives charity from the money she earns, oh Woman woe to you, neither commit Zina nor give in charity.<br /><br />Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī said,<br /><br />“The first person to innovate (the Milād or Mawlid) was the ruler or Erbil, Malik Muẓaffar Abū Saʿīd al-Kaukabūrī.” [al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189]<br /><br />It must be noted here that Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭi’s assertion and support of the Mawlid  in his ‘Ḥusn al-Maqsid Fī Aʿmal al-Mawlid’ which is a part of his ‘al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa’ was mere reciting of poems and narrating ahadith and athar of his virtue ie his Shamaʿil and nothing of the nature of the current day corruptive heretical practises.<br /><br />Thus, the Barailwī’s and Sūfī’s scampering and scuttling in order to shield themselves behind Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī is futile because he did not advocate nor propagate any of the things this lot gets up to. It must be said based on what we know of Ḥafiẓ Suyūṭi and giving him the benefit of the doubt and with books like ‘Miftaḥ al-Jannah Bi-Ihtijāj al-Sunnah’ and al-Amr al-Ittiba etc.<br /><br />Neşet Çaǧatay further presents Ḥāfiẓ Suyūṭī’s opinion which also ties in with what other historians have stated with regards to the origins and beginnings of the Mawlid.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=96" class="postimage" alt="suyuti3.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />Neşet Çaǧatay went on to say<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=97" class="postimage" alt="Khalkan4.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.129 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />This is what Shaikh Ibn Khalkān said after witnessing a gathering of Mawlid and Milād celebrations and festivities. This is a first hand direct account, he said,<br /><br />“His people were well aware of his extravagance and belief in the Milād and the people from the surrounding towns and areas ie Baghdād, Moṣul, Jazirah, Sinjār, Naṣibīn and other neighbouring countries would visit him. From amongst these people were Jurists, the Sūfi’s, admonishers, reciters and poets. The people would begin visiting him from Muharram and this would continue until Rabī al-Awwal. Malik Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī would instruct his people to make 20 wooden mobile dome and each dome would have 4 or 5 levels. He would reserve one for himself and the remaining ones would be for his ministers and advisers. He would decorate them making them flamboyant, he would place musical instruments on them, from the Tabla and other violin based instruments on the different levels of the domes. The people would close their businesses and visit the festivities and celebrations. The domes would be lined in an open area starting from his palace and ending at the Khanqah (Sufi Convents). Sulṭān Muzaffar al-Dīn would visit every dome on a daily basis after Asr, he would listen to the music and look at the drama. He would eventually retire to the Khanqah where gatherings of Music (Qawali – Shirki trance esoteric type of music) would be in full swing and then eventually after the morning prayer he would go hunting. He would return to his Palace before Ẓuhr and this would be his norm during the Milād days. He would celebrate the Milād on the 8th of Rabī al-Awwal one year and then on the 12th of Rabī al-Awwal in the following year due to the difference of opinion regarding the Prophets birthday. A few nights before the Milād, he would march into the open field with his musicians, camels, cows and other animals. He would then sacrifice them and then instruct various types of dishes to be cooked. Then after Maghrib on the evening of Milād he would organise a gathering, thousands of candles lit, some of them were huge which he would use in the procession. The Palace would be decorated and he would make a grand entrance. The huge candles would be places on a platform supported by a person which would eventually make their way to his chambers via procession for the festivities.” [Wafyāt al-A’yān Wa Anbā Ibnā al-Zamān [4:117]<br /><br />Sabṭ Ibn al-Jawzī said,<br /><br />“A person who visited the Milād gathering and celebrations of Muzaffar al-Dīn Kaukabūrī said the food entailed 5,000 cooked goats, 10,000 hens, 100 horses and 100,000 plates of sweets and 30,000 plates of sweet pudding. Well-known and famous learned men and Sūfīs would visit his Milād gatherings, who would be gowned with specific dress wear. He would generously gift them and would also organise sittings of music infested Qawalis from Ẓuhr until Fajr for the Sufīs. He would participate and dance with them. He would spend approximately 300,000 Dinārs every year on the Milād gathering.” [Mirāh al-Zamān [8:681], see also Suyūti, al-Ḥawī Lil-Fatāwa [1:189-190].

The people of innovation further distorted this by opening the doors to further corruption and deviation by introducing corrupt innovation and practices.<br /><br />Such practices are evident in society today, which are not restricted to any particular area, but rather they are global. Such examples include the formation of images and physical creation of the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam sandals paving the way for idol worship. Cooking lavish and extravagant food and organising gatherings ie ‘Mehfils,’ which are specifically organised by the women.<br /><br />They deliberately disturb the community by running havoc in the towns by marching and in processions with music and drums. This is often accompanied with both genders dancing whilst free mixing, in some countries where there is no free mixing and dancing, it is compensated by drums and loud chants in unison.<br /><br />The houses are decorated and adorned with green lights, often in the shape of the Prophetic Sandal. Some people have their whole house decorated with the lights as if were a wedding. One only needs to do a basic search on the internet and you tube nowadays in order uncover the horrific and disastrous scale the shape the innovation of Mawlid has taken and the associated rejected practice that accompany it.      <br /><br />As mentioned, the Mawlid before was reciting and reading eulogies and poems of praise on the Prophets Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam’s birthday. The Mawlid would be recited when someone would recover from an accident or calamity and at times, it would be recited in order to fulfil a vow or oath. They would also recite it when there was need, desire or wish for something.<br /><br />The Mawlid would often be recited and read annually after the demise of a close relative. This is also a sub continent practice of venerating the dead and holy saints by celebrating their birthdays also commemorating them bur organising festivities with food and gatherings and Sufi Qawali Music. This is commonly known as Urs or Barsi.<br /><br />Coincidently the first work ever written on the Mawlid was titled al-Arūs as per Neşet Çaǧatay in her paper ‘The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey’ [pp.128] and she attributed it to an Ibn al-Jawzī of the 6 century Hijri!!!

It will be shown later that the Mawlid was borrowed from practices that originated Pre Islam and this is a testimony of it being a clear cut innovation.<br /><br />The practice of reciting Mawlid was also performed on the 40th day after someone death. In her paper, Neşet Çaǧatay, ‘The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey’ adds numerous other reasons, she says<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=91" class="postimage" alt="Picture2.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=92" class="postimage" alt="Picture3a.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br />[Neşet Çaǧatay, The Tradition of Mavlid Recitations in Islam Particularly in Turkey, [pp.127-128 Studia Islamic No. 28, 1968ce, Maisonneuve &amp; Larose]<br /><br />The Mawlid was innovated as a joint venture and collaboration between a Sūfī and the reigning King at the time. He was the King of Irbil, which is located northwest of Baghdād and Suleimanīyyah, North or Kirkuk and South East of Mosul.<br /><br />His name was Muzaffar al-Dīn bin Abīl Ḥasan ʿAlī bin Baktakin bin Muḥammad al-Kaukabūrī (Gökböri), his kunyah was Abū Saʿīd and his royal title was al-Malik al-Muʿaẓam. He was the brother in law of the Muslim Warrior Sulṭān, Ṣalah al-Dīn al-Ayyūbī.<br /><br />Muzaffar al-Dīn was Turkic or Turcoman in origin with ancestry tracing back to Seljuk Turks. He served under the Muslim Zengid dynasty who were Oghuz Turk ie Turkmen on behalf of the Seljuk empire and they ruled parts of the Levant and Upper Mesopotamia which is mostly current day Syria. He also served under Ṣalah al-Dīn’s Ayyubi’s dynasty, which was of Kurdish origin and they ruled over old Egypt and mid Arabia.<br /><br />His father, Zain al-Dīn Ali Kutchek was the Governor of Irbil (Erbil, Arbela) when he died in the year 563H/1168ce his son succeeded him as the ruler of Erbil but was later deposed, Ṣalah al-Dīn reinstated his rule over Erbil again in the year 586H/1190ce.<br /><br />Prior to his era the Fatimids were engrossed in their Ghulu and extreme praise and veneration of the household of the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam even to the level of claiming divinity for some of them and other such corrupt beliefs. They most certainly had a major role to play in the introduction of this malevolence innovation.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-papers-part-26-the-history-and-origins-of-the-mawlid-and-milad-celebrations-analysing-neset-caǧatays-paper-the-tradition-of-mavlid-recit/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-mawlid-pape ... lid-recit/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2016 11:28 pm</p><hr />
