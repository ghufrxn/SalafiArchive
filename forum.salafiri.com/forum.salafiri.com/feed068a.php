<title type="html"><![CDATA[Refuting Ahl al-Bidah causes Separation - Shaikh Fawzan]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=1320&amp;p=1401#p1401"><![CDATA[
Shaikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan was asked, <br /><br /><em>“Many of the people say that the refuters of Ahlul Bidah are separators, causing separation?”</em><br /><br />The Shaikh replied:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">“Yes, they cause separation between truth and falsehood. This is correct. We make a distinction between the truth and falsehood, between the people of truth and those of falsehood. We are going to refute ahl ul bidah and so did the scholars refute ahl ul bidah. This is not the cause of division, but its to gather the people upon the truth, because with people remaining upon misguidance and the speech which is falsehood then it is this that causes division amongst the muslims. As for clarifying the truth for the people, so they can gather upon it, then this is the dawah towards unity and not teh dawah towards separation. The dawah towards separation is when it is said ‘the people of falsehood are not to be refuted’. This is dawah of disunity if only they ponder! And allah knows best”{Q&amp;A session, Riyaadh, 2011)</span></span><br /></div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 6:25 pm</p><hr />
