				<h3>On A Husband Forcing A Fiqh Opinion On His Wife</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[44] Question</span></strong>: If a woman disagrees with her husband over a Fiqh issue, such as travelling without a mahram, then in general, can he force his Fiqh opinion on her?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer</span></strong>: <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;Men are guardians over women due to what Allaah has favored some of them over others with.&quot;</span></strong> <em>[Surah An-Nisaa: 34]</em><br /><br />So with regard to the likes of this question, the opinion of one of the spouses – either the wife or the husband – must be carried out. And there is no doubt that so long as Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, has made it obligatory upon the woman to obey the husband, her opinion is not a decisive factor. So in this situation, she must obey him. However, before that, they must first yield to one another and communicate to try to come to an understanding with one another.<br /><br />But if (after doing this) the situation has reached the point at which the question was asked, then the answer is that (at this point) it is obligatory upon her to obey him and to not oppose him. <br /><br />[<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Al-Asaalah</span></strong>, Issue # 19]</div>
