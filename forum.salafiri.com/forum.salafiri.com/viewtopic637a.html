				<h3>Washing the Hands Before the Face During Wudhoo</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jan 02, 2017 12:55 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> I was performing Wudhoo for Salaah and I forgot to wash my face and washed my hands [2]. I then remembered that, so I washed my face, then my hands[3] and then completed the Wudhoo. Is there anything upon (me) with regards to that? And O Eminent Shaykh! What if somebody forgets to wash his face and did not remember this until he finished the Wudhoo? Please give us the Islaamic ruling, may Allaah reward you with good.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> There is nothing upon you with regards to that, because you went back, washed your face and then you washed your hands[4] and then completed the Wudhoo. As for the one who left out (washing) his face and did not remember it until he finished the Wudhoo, consequently he must redo the wudhoo because it is an obligation to maintain it’s sequence and wash the prescribed bodily parts in succession without interruption (whilst performing Wudhoo).<br /><br />And Allaah is the Possessor of all success.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Reference:</span></strong> <em>Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Ibn Baaz: Vol: 8</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] Up to the elbows<br />[2] Up to the elbows<br />[3] Again for a second time<br />[4] Again for a second time</div>
