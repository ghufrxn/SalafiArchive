<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #000080">Tremendous Advice of the Salaf for Bro Hajji; ‘Saved Sect Syndrome’</span></span></strong><br /><br /><br />ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl said, Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah said to us:<br /><br /><strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #BF4000">Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, do not turn away from it. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. Do not deviate to the right or to the left of the Straight Path. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, just as the people [Ṣaḥābah] were upon, before the killing of their Ṣaḥābah [i.e. ʿUthmān] and what they did after that [i]. For indeed we had read the Qurʾān 15 years before the Ṣaḥābah were killed and before what these people did after that. So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of enmity and hatred amongst you.”<br /><br />ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl said: I informed al-Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī] what Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah had said. He replied, “He spoke the truth and advised you with it”. Then I narrated this to Hafṣah bint Sirīn and she said, “You are family, have you narrated this to Muḥammad?” [ii] I said, “No”. She said, “Narrate this to him.”</span><br /></div></blockquote></strong><br /><br />[Imām Muḥammad b. Naṣr al-Marūdhī, al-Sunnah, 68-69 no.18. Khalid b. ʿUthmān said, it is Ṣaḥīḥ Maqtuʿa, [meaning that it is authentic but the type of report is Maqtuʿa i.e. from a Tabʿī]. He references it to al-Maʿmar, al-Jāmʿi 11:367; LālikāʿI, Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah no.17; Abū Nuʿaym, al-Ḥilyah 2:218; al-ʿAjurrī, al-Sharīʿah no.19, 21 and Ibn Baṭṭah al-Ibānah 1:96. He shows all the narrators are trustworthy. (Cairo: Dār al-Athār, 2003)<br /><br />In the Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah of al-Lālikāʿī the report is, “Learn Islam and when you’ve learnt it, do not turn away from it. And follow the Straight path, for that is Islam. Do not deviate to the right or to the left of [the straight path of] Islam. Upon you is the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, which the Ṣaḥābah were upon, So, I warn you from these desires that sow the seeds of enmity and hatred amongst you.” [Lālikāʿi, Sharḥ Uṣūl Iʿtiqād Ahl al-Sunnah Waʾl Jamāʿah no.17, 40. The researcher, Dr. ʿImād Qadrī graded it Ṣaḥīḥ and traces it to ʿAbd al-Razzāq, Muṣannaf no.20758; Abū Nuʿaym, al-Ḥilyah 2:218; Ibn ʿAdiyy, al-Kāmil 3:163. (Cairo: Dār al-Gad al-Jadīd, 1438/2017).<br /><br />In the Kitāb Sharīʿah of al-ʿĀjurrī he brings it in the second chapter, mentioning the command of the Prophet ﷺ to the Ummah to hold onto the Jamaʿāh and warning them from dividing into sects. (Kitāb Sharīʿah, 1:284). The researcher, Dr. ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. ʿUmar b. Sulaymān al-Damijī graded it its chain Ṣaḥīḥ. He traces it to ʿAbd al-Razzāq, Muṣannaf no.20758 in summarised form; al-Marūdhī, al-Sunnah, 8, Ibn Waḍāh, al-Bidʿah Waʾl Nahya ʿAnhā, 32-33; LālikāʿI, Sharḥ Uṣūl 1:56 no.17; Ibn Baṭṭah, al-Ibānah al-Kubrā no.115, 138. (al-ʿĀjurrī, Kitāb Sharīʿah. 1:300 no.19. (Riyadh: Madār al-Waṭan Lil-Nashr, 1437/2016) 4th Edition).<br /><br />Ibn Baṭṭah transmits it his al-Ibānah al-Kubrā, 1:113 no.146. The researcher Al-Ḥamdān fails to mention any tracing or a grade for it. (Ibn Baṭṭah, al-Ibānah al-Kubrā. (Beirut: Dār al-Lūʾlūʾ, 1439/2018) 2nd Edition). Ibn Baṭṭah also brings this report in the same chapter title as the of al-ʿAjurrī.<br /><br /><strong>NOTES</strong><br /><br />[i] - This is what the Khawārij did after that period, in terms of reckless killing, rebelling against the legitimate Muslim rulers, killing innocent people and making takfīr of the Muslims.<br /><br />[ii] – He is the great Imām, Muḥammad b. Sirīn from the Salaf, well known for his stance against the people of innovation and desires.<br /><br />This anecdote and advice of the Salaf advising to stick to the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger ﷺ and not to deviate from the straight path. Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah talks about the Khawārij and their killing of ʿUthmān RaḍīAllāhu ʿAnhu, their enmity for him and making takfīr and opposing all those who loved and revered him. He rebukes their actions and their methodology by describing it as desires. The harms of these desires were splitting the unity of the Muslims and breaking away from the Jamāʿah of the Muslim body.<br /><br />We also learn how the Salaf were uniform and in agreement in such matters of Creed and Manhaj. All the aforementioned eminent Salafi Ahl al-Hadith scholars quote this account in the beginning of their respective Creed manuals, thereby giving weight to its content. Furthermore, the same Ahl al-Ḥadīth Salafī scholars place the account under the chapter of being united with the Muslim body and staying away from dividing into sects and groups.<br /><br />Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah adds, such ideas and ideologies that opposes the path of the companions, not only are they deviation, but they will also sow seeds of hatred in the Muslim Ummah. This is what we see, the oblivious individual, in addition to being weak in his knowledge and comprehension, is vehemently ardent in misguiding and confusing the Sunni Muslims. Individuals like Bro Hajji, are a 3D epitome and prime example of what the Salaf warned us from, they are nothing except concubines of the Khawārij, standing or sitting. They opened the doors for the worshippers of grave, the Rawafidh and sowed seeds of doubting the understanding of the illustrious Ṣaḥābah.<br /><br />The statement was profound - it led ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl to inform Ḥasan al-Baṣrī who endorsed the advice. Āṣim Aḥwāl then informs the daughter of Muḥammad b. Sirīn, who advices him to inform her father. This aspect of the account highlights how the eminent Salaf valued advice from their predecessors and hence its great importance. The Salaf named in this account were mounts of knowledge and all of them warned us from the Khārijī renegades, just like we see today.<br /><br />Unbeknown to these off-the-shelf renegades, hurling labels like Madkhalis, Murji’s and institutional one thing or another, while being dreary, pathetic and unwanted shrieks does not and In-shāʾ-Allāh will not harm us and neither is it new for us. We have heritage and a rich history that extends to the Salaf, a little further than the walls of their front rooms and videos. Will they have the audacity to label 5 of the Salaf, Abuʾl ʿĀliyyah, ʿĀṣim Aḥwāl, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, Hafṣah bint Sirīn and Muḥammad b. Sirīn? as Madkhalis, waste papers institutionalised bootlickers?<br /><br />It is embarrassing to see Bro Hajji relying on substandard research and debunked. I have the displeasure of seeing a short clip today, and this poor individual was struggling to read basic technical terms and names in English, yet he wants to cause confusion on issues which are well over his job description.<br /><br />Let, these words of the Salaf be an admonition for Bro Hajji and his sympathisers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Jun 24, 2020 11:59 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #000080">Breaking and Dismantling Bro Hajji - Part 4</span></span></strong><br /><br />In a few videos Bro Hajji references the honourable companion, Nu'man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu &amp; the Tab'i, al-Sha'bi from among those who rebelled! He uses their actions as unchallenged evidence while refuting the accepted And established view of Ahl al-Sunnah, which is not to rebel. The correct understanding, as the early scholars of Islam have explained will be inshaAllah presented later, with a plethora of statements that represent how Ahl al-Sunnah understood these events.<br /><br />Bro Hajji repeatedly Alleges that Salafis distort views, that they are selective in their quotations and thus, they ultimately misrepresent the truth. Without exceeding this particular part more than what is required. In the following Hadith, the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasalam said...<br /><br /><strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #BF4000">&quot;(The Muslims being a collective communal body) al-Jama'ah is mercy and splitting is punishment&quot; </span><br /></div></blockquote></strong><br /><br />which is transmitted by Nu'man b. Bashir RadhiAllahu Anhu and in turn al-Sha'bi transmits it from him.<br /><br />I have highlighted the references for this hadith, where Dr. Basim al-Jawabirah Grades the chain Hasan - good, in his checking of <strong><em>Kitab al-Sunnah</em> of Imam Ibn Abi Asim (d.287H) (no.93, p.61)</strong>, at the end of the references, al-Haithami is quoted as saying, all of the narrators in the chain are trustworthy. <br /><br />Furthermore, the celebrated Salafi theologist, Ibn Battah (387H) transmits the same Hadith in his <strong><em>al-Ibanah (1:107 no.128)</em></strong>, but with a variation in the chain. The statement of Ibn Abi Hatim from his father, is answered by an alternative chain that authenticates it. So the Hadith is authentic.<br /><br />Therefore, this shows they were against splitting or separating from the Jama'ah of Muslims, knowing that it was tantamount to punishment and being united as a collective Muslim body was a mercy. So they knew this Hadith and what occured with them cannot fall under rebellion, because that is splitting and Separating from the Jama'ah of the Muslims. So, with a single Hadith, we dismantle the feeble and weak arguments of Bro Hajji.<br /><br /><strong>BENEFIT</strong><br />Imam Ibn Abi Asim died (287H) exactly <strong>100 years</strong> before Imam Ibn Battah (387H).<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=194" class="postimage" alt="al-sunnah cov.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=195" class="postimage" alt="al-sunnah text.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=196" class="postimage" alt="ibanah cov.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="https://forum.salafiri.com/download/file.php?id=197" class="postimage" alt="ibanah text.jpeg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Jun 23, 2020 12:21 am</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #000080">Breaking Down &amp; Dismantling Bro Hajji - Part 3</span></span></strong><br /><br />@BroHajji claims he is an <strong>Athari Hanafi</strong> and throughout his videos he fails to utilise any of these schools as authority to evidence his claims. He, at one time uses al-Jassas. This nexus in general is highly problematic, which we will Deconstruct later, inshaAllah. In some of his videos, as relayed to us, he relies on Imams Ibn Hazm and Ibn Abd al-Barr, both 5th century Sunni polymaths.<br /><br /><strong>Bro Hajji's main argument is that when the ruler takes your wealth and women, Ibn Hazm and others permitted Khuruj. Therefore The central argument is, if the ruler is oppressive in this way, it's permissible to rebel against him</strong>. So, we say: we will return to Ibn Hazm and Ibn Abd al-Barr at a later stage, but let us refer back to the annals of history and look at the affairs that preceded their era. <br /><br />We will look at how rulers and those in authority did some of these things but despite this, there were no widespread collective organised rebellions ie khuruj, except some riots and general skirmishes. <br /><br />Almost 100-150 years before Ibn Hazm &amp; Ibn Abd al-Barr, in the 4th century (300+), Baghdad and the surrounding aree faced great upheavel, turmoil and an extremely difficult financial crisis, that lasted for over 100 years. <br /><br />Governance was very difficult, wuzara (ministers) had to borrow money to pay soldiers, general property was insecure and was the Subject of confiscation by government officials, soldiers or military personnel. There was general plundering, shops and markets were burned, there were  floods, epidemics and famine, which was often accompanied with regular food riots.<br /><br />General financial revenue was in decline From the various lands in terms of taxes. The government introduced iqta, which essentially means transferring the ownership of land. With this decline the government began paying soldiers with iqta land. They also tried to extort money from previous officials. They tried To collect more tax but all failed.<br /><br />From around 305-328 taxes on people, farmers increased. The governor's for the rulers failed to pay taxes themselves. The military governors of Wasit and Basra both declined to pay. With little money the government resorted to Iqta. Only the The leader or Imam could transfer land to those who needed paying, but a small surcharge applied. (Qudama b. Jafar, Kitab al-Kharaj, 1:124, al-Khwarizmi, Mafatih al-Ulum, 1:38) and only the land the ruler owned could be transferred. (Al-Mawardi, Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah, 1:183).<br /><br />In Due course the rulers changed the rules and began to transfer land they didn't own and thus could do that to anyone's land, any farmer or poor person. This lead to the military and senior military personnel confiscating land of the poor. The military class flourished, they Got richer as well as the elite upper class government officials. Natural disasters, epidemics caused more problems and poor farmers had less land to cultivate. They eventually were unable to pay land rent and the senior government officials and military took the lands. Those who Retained their land, had to give some of it to the military elite in order to seek protection from other government officials who were extorting them. Government officials across the board began taxing waqf land and took the land expenses. <br /><br />The elite of society were gifted Iqta land which included singers, merchants and other influential people. On the other hand the evil Qaramatah continued their relentless attack on the state. Throughout this period tax collectors became extremely rich, military officers and wuzara used extortion on a daily basis, Food markets were pillaged due to the shortage of cash and food. Regular soldiers and low level officials extorting food merchants and they were even tortured.<br /><br />Many merchants and business owners abandoned major cities including Baghdad due to riots and civil unrest in general Warehouse owners hid wheat and other grains in fear of the administration. Senior government officials would steal and confiscate the food and this even led to people being killed, these events took place around 334H<br /><br />Around 381H food merchants were robbed again by government Officials and mass riots ensued. (Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam 2:331, al-Suli, al-Akhbar al-Radi 2:78, al-Hamdani, Takmilah Tarikh al-Tabari 1:135, al-Rudhrawari, Dhayl Tajarib al-Umam 3:189, 198, 259)<br /><br />In 350H Mu'izz al-Dawla, the ruler and leader destroyed houses in order to build His residence, he forced people to sell their properties. He then levied huge taxes and confiscated the wealth of the people. (Al-Dhahabi, Tarikh Islam 1:189, Ibn Tughri, al-Nujum al-Zahirah 3:327)<br /><br />In 373H similar things ensued, heavy taxes were imposed and commodities were very Expensive to purchase. This caused more anger, the people damaged masajids and at one stage prevented people from praying. The governor's imposed taxes on clothes and other basic stuff whicd led people to riot, further turmoil and chaos (Dhayl Tarajib al-Umam 3:85, al-Muntazam 7:121-127, al-Bidayah Wal Nihayah 11:303)<br /><br />Political instability, bad administration, greed, natural disasters, floods, crop failure, primitive agricultural, socio-political issues, religious  observances, sects and Madhhahib all contributed to problems in various Muslim cities And Baghdad. In 423H, 431, 439 and 448 people suffered from the rise of food prices which lead to famine and disease. between 466-469 there was a flood every year in Baghdad which caused a lot of problems as described above. (al-Muntazam 7:174 and most of volume 8 describes these Events, al-Bidayah 12:71-72) <br /><br />Despite all of this, the Muslims didn't rebel, they didn't do khuruj, raise arms and fight the rulers. Yes they did riot, they did express their anger and even killed people but there was no organised Khuruj to dispose the rulers. Were they upset And angry, well of course they were, but they had patience in their own way. Skirmishes, local rioting and some unfavourable activities were and are not considered making khuruj. History teaches us, this even led the rulers to change policies.<br /><br />In this part I've presented A very basic synopsis of some of the events to show what Muslims had to endure during that era. So if they did not rebel, modern day people, like the debunked Dodgy Bro Hajji have no right to tell people that Khuruj was an option or is still a viable option despite not being The first method of rectification. As the salaf said, we will refute Ahl al-Bidah through history.<br /><br />Incompetent and hasty people like bro Hajji are a testimony to the authenticity of the ahadith which mention the ruwaybidah will disseminate views and opinions by which they will Misguide themselves and others.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Jun 23, 2020 12:02 am</p><hr />

We ask, the Sunni scholars must've rebelled against the Fatimid Isma'ils, Ubaydullah &amp; his son Abul Qasim, who prevented Jumuah, right? <br /><br />They want you to make Khuruj like the Qarmatah did. Who used to attack the Hajj caravans (around 299H). They attacked Basra in 311H, killed it's inhabitants and destroyed their property. The same year they attacked the Hajj Caravans. In 315H they attacked Baghdad and ransacked it. In 317H they stole the black stone and took it to Bahrayn, it was only returned in 339H (after 22 years). This is just a Snippet of the things Khuruj produced. <br /><br />Now, <strong><span style="color: #BF4040">these textbook ruwaybidah, who articulate shi'i tendencies, be it Fatimiyyah or Qaramatah</span></strong> want to say, Khuruj is a valid difference!

They proceed to support this view by citing the differences and incidences that occurred between the illustrious Sahabah. When we are told, through divine texts that when the Sahabah are mentioned then, WITHHOLD. The Rawafidh spew fabrication After fabrication and these ruwaybidah, get affected by their doctrine and in turn they say well, the Sahabah did make khuruj and they did kill each other etc, the shi'i laughs and says &quot;see I told you&quot;. <br /><br />It is this ruwaybid, front room camera loving little pappu Who loved the fame, the cameras of Hyde Park, a well done son from his ignorant followers which boosted his pea sized brain to the size of the ego he has.

He went onto say al-Barbahari's Sharh al-Sunnah was the Talmud of the Madkhalis, but al-Barbahari was the face of the Athari's. <br /><br /><strong>Any sane intelligent person would ask Where does that leave Hajji? This so called Athari, sits with the Sufi Deobandi Ash'ari Maturidis, who attack the Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith for their belief in Asma wa'l Sifat on their hanafi fiqh channel, where they push their innovative ta'wil, yet all parties are best of mates Bro Hajji holds the view; the truth is with the Ahl al-Hadith and Deobandis! </strong><br /><br />This is in of itself pure deviancy and this front room camera loving boy thinks it's acceptable. Not at all, not even the Deobandis say this, who are firm on their Maturidi belief system, even though it Is corrupt &amp; contradicts the belief system of the Salaf. <br /><br /><strong>Bro Hajji, to this day has failed to shake of his Deobandi Hanafi Maturidi beliefs</strong>. He wants to be the new talmudic saviour and refute the Salafis but it's all fun and games with the Hanafi Deobandis. This is the true reality Of Hajji.<br /><br /><strong>The Deobandis believe in Wahdatul Wajud, deny Allah's Uluww, seek intercession with the dead, seek help from Abdul Qadir Jilani yet Hajji's motor mouth is zipped and hush hush because he doesn't want to upset his true ancestors.</strong> <br /><br />When pressed by a Rafidhi to state his Manhaj he first laughs and then disgracefully fails the basic aspects of Sunnism of declaring his Athari-Hanafi nexus. So much so, the Rafidi shi'i was forced to say to him <strong><em>&quot;are you doing Ta'qiyyah&quot;</em></strong>. Prior to that Hajji tells the Rafidi to ascertain what kind of Sunni he is.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">WHAT! Exactly. </span></strong><br /><br />The Athari's and Salafis were always one, they still are and they will continue to be, but this new hybrid breed (as the Rafidi Shi'a) says to Bro Hajji, is a breed that are nothing but the Ruwaybidah who seek to sever the link between the Sunni layman and The Rabbani Sunni scholars. <br /><br />Bro Hajji claims I've not studied, and if he had done his research, like he rants in the video like a mad man, that he found out who I was in half an hour, then 1. I was not hiding, I think he spent too much time with the Rafidah, that he got obsessed with the hole of the 12th Imam. <br /><br />2. That I still currently study. In fact by the way of information, <strong>I started to intensely study, when Bro Hajji was 12 years old, when he was beginning to learn how to make his tie for his school uniform!</strong> This being said, <strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Bro Hajji has no Islamic Education at all whatsoever. He has not studied with anyone, never sat with any scholar for formal learning, never learnt any book on Aqidah, Manhaj or fiqh or even a basic primer.</span></strong> <em><strong><span style="color: #BF4000">He probably has studied Ta'lim ul-Islam, Ta'lim ul-Haq</span></strong></em> and the <span style="color: #BF4000"><strong>infamous Beshiti Zewar</strong></span>! He spent ‎Nominal years with a Madinah University Graduate, who I know personally, his learning with him was purely Arabic ا ب ت. So, we find this front room camera loving stubborn boy knows absolutely nothing. <br /><br />He bought a few books, did some basic research in Shia'ism and we have a Bonafide ruwaybidah. At one stage this <strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Deobandi Ash'ari Maturidis Hanafi sympathetiser was volunteering at a Deobandi Masjid</span></strong> when Sh Sudais came to Birmingham. He shrugs at the idea of him being a closet Ash'ari, this is like the Sufi Barelwi who believes that Allah incarnates Into humans, even he claims he is Salafi because he make taqlid of Abu Hanifah. <br /><br />We can perhaps extend this to the recent deception of the people of <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>ta'wil and tafwidh who say, we follow the Creed of the Salaf, we are Athari but they intend with this Tafwidh al-Ma'ana A Salafi or Athari is the one who is Athari in Aqidah and Manhaj, they are interlinked and mutually exclusive, not this Deobandi Maturidi pick and choose, like the Zanadiqah. </strong></span><br /><br />Mr Bro Hajji full of himself says, I'm an Athari-Hanafi. Okay, so If we go back and look at an Athari-Hanafi, for arguments lets take Imam Tahawi and Imam Ibn Abil Izz, they refuted khuruj and advocated obeying the ruler! Bro Hajji doesn't even have them to back his pick and choose corrupt methodology. <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">This is the video where the Shia says to Bro Hajji are you doing Taqiyyah. You spend time with the innovators, you become like them.</span></strong><br /><br />We, the Salafis know our Din and this &quot;one&quot; man army as he likes to delude himself into thinking, is going to refute us!!<br /><br /><center> <strong>iframe</strong> </center><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Mon Jun 22, 2020 1:13 am</p><hr />

<em>Adaptation: Taalib Alexander</em><br /><br />1. They are the followers of Syrian Muslim ideologue ‘Muhammad Zain-ul-Abidin Surur’.<br /><br />2. Surur was born in Syria in 1938 CE;<br /><br />3. He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood – Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen – leaving Syria after the Ikhawani insurrection for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;<br /><br />4. In Saudia Arabia he was a teacher in the Mahad al-Ilmi in Buraidah.<br /><br />5. From among his students is Salman al-Awdah;<br /><br />6. After leaving Saudi he moved to Kuwait then the United Kingdom where he set up a number of organisations. From among them: Markaz Dirasat al-Sunnah al-Nabawwiyah in Birmingham and al-Muntada al-Islami in London. He founded as-Sunnah Magazine which was one of the main organs for propagating his thought;<br /><br />7. The main characteristic of Surur and his dawah are:<br /><em><ul>A. Apparently holding the main principles of Salafee creed while following the methodology – manhaj – of the Muslim brotherhoods;<br />B. Affirming the methodology of Sayyid Qutub;<br />C. Apparently affirming the three categories of Towheed while adding an extra category – something rejected by the scholars – called Towheed-ul-Hakimiyyah;<br />D. Promoting a political agenda at the expense of dawah and calling to Towheed;<br />E. Calling to unity irrespective of Aqeedah;<br />F. Undermining the Salafi scholars through – false – doubts and aspersions;<br />G. Organising their followers, Like the Ikhaan-ul-Muslimun, into secret cluster – often called’families’ – in which baya’ah- Oath of Alleginece – may be requested (for example, Ittihad al-Islami of Somalia, a Muntada lead organisation);</ul></em><br /><br />8.

Numerous questions, which were put forth by Prince Mamdooh Ibn Abdil-Azeez, have circulated the news websites today, regarding how the heads of the Ikhwaan4 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have described him. At the head of them is Salmaan Al-Awdah, Naasir Al-Umar, and Muhammad Al-Areefi as well as others similar to them.<br /><br />The Prince said: ‘Since you do not wish to have a sensible debate with anyone from As-Salafiyyah [5] despite their invitations to you for more than twenty years, then indeed I bear the responsibility of questioning you;<br /><br /><strong>The 1st Question:</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">I challenge all of you that a judgment be brought between us, regarding that which you wrote, and spread, and made apparent through various media sources, and that your calling to Tawheed be assessed, despite the billions of times you have all been spoken to?</span><br /><br /><strong>The 2nd Question:</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">I challenge you with all of that which has perfused from your tongues - in defense of the beloved one of Muhammad Ibn Abdillaah (Sallallaahu Alayhi wa Sallam), the Mother of the Believers [6] - when the most dreadful of people from the Raafidhah [7] persisted upon her and established a festival in London for an entire week in order to abuse her name and attribute adultery to her? [8]</span><br /><br /><strong>The 3rd Question:</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">I want you to swear by the name of Allaah, or to stand and let both parties invoke the curse of Allaah upon the liar, that Abdullaah Ibn Abdil-Azeez [9] is your sharee’ah legislated Muslim ruler, inwardly and outwardly, and that you do not deem this position of ruler ship to be for anyone else, neither secretly nor openly?</span><br /><br /><strong>The 4th Question:</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">What do you say regarding the founder of these lands and the one who spread Tahweed in them, by the grace of Allaah upon him, Abdul-Azeez Ibn Adbur-Rahmaan[10]? And what do you say regarding the spreader of corruption Hassan Al-Bannaa(11), and Sayyid Qutb [12]?</span><br /><br />I appeal to Allaah about you, that you answer, even if it be one question. And after this for every incident there can be a discussion, and the courts are open if you wish to complain. I complain of you to Allaah The High, The Powerful, that He takes the worst revenge from you urgently without delay. And that He exposes your devilish writings, you, those with you, and those who are behind you.<br /><br />There are a great number of questions, and I ask Allaah Almightly, the Lord of the Great Throne, that He causes their answer to come to light over you sooner rather than later, you and your companions from the Ikhwaan (Al-Muslimeen).<br /><br />Oh my leader, King; I am ready for judgment if you wish to try me – So are they (the Ikhwaani group) also ready?’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />1) Salman bin Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ouda<br /><br />2) Nasser Al-Omar<br /><br />3) Muhammad Abdur-Rahman Al-Arifi<br /><br />4) The organization/sect known as Al-Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon (The Muslim Brotherhood established by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt in 1928. They are an Islamic activism group who accept the beliefs of Muslims from the deviated groups, they also accept and promote rebelling against legitimate Muslim rulers.<br /><br />5) The way of the Ahlus-sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – those who follow the sunnah and the methodology of the salaf (first three generations beginning with the Sahaabah, and the pious imams after them), the correct and saved sect.<br /><br />6) Aa’ishah (Radhiyallaahu Anhaa)<br /><br />7) The Shee’ah – The term Raafidhah literally means those who desert and reject, i.e. the khilaafah and honour of the righteous Sahaabah. They declare many great companions to be disbelievers, claim that the Qur’an is incomplete, and consider their Imams such as Khomeni to be greater than the Prophets of Allaah.<br /><br />8) Allaah freed our Mother Aa’ishah from this accusation in the Qur’aan itself – The ayaat are in Surah An-Noor: Verily those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah) are a group among you.<br /><br />9) Abdullah bin Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman bin Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud – King of Saudi Arabia.<br /><br />10) King Abdul-Azeez Abdur-Rahman Ibn Saud <br /><br />11) Hasan Ahmed Abdel Rahman Muhammed al-Banna – 1906-1949 - Founder of Ikhwaan ul Muslimeen (not to be confused with the current Salafee Shaykh Hasan Al-Banna in Egypt) <br /><br />12) Sayyid Qutb, 1906-1966, Egyptian author and thinker, leading member of the Al-Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon. He has been written about and refuted for his many deviations by various scholars from the Ahlus-Sunnah.<br /><br />Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment. (11). Why then, did not the believers, men and women, when you heard it (the slander), think good of their own people and say: &quot;This (charge) is an obvious lie ?&quot; (12) Why did they not produce four witnesses? Since they (the slanderers) have not produced witnesses! Then with Allah they are the liars. (13) Had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy unto you in this world and in the Hereafter, a great torment would have touched you for that whereof you had spoken. (14) When you were propagating it with your tongues, and uttering with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge, you counted it a little thing, while with Allah it was very great. (15) And why did you not, when you heard it, say: &quot;It is not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You (O Allah)! This is a great lie.&quot; (16) Allah forbids you from it and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=199&amp;p=205#p205"><![CDATA[
All Praises are due for Allaah, the Lord of the creation. Ar-Rahmaan, ar-Raheem. Master of the Day of Judgement.<br /><br />I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allaah, having no partners, for Him is the Dominion, the Lord of Clear Truth.<br /><br />I bear witness that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger, the truthful and trustworthy one. May the Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him, his family, and all of his Companions.<br /><br />To proceed:<br /><br />Surely, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with its men, its resources and its establishments, have put forth an enormous effort in order to cater for the needs of the Pilgrims – those coming to preform Hajj, ‘Umrah and visiting of religious landmarks. For decades this country anticipates the season of Hajj with a generous budget and employment of increased manpower, an exertion that any country would be proud of. None of this can be belittled nor negated in the event of an accident caused by overcrowding, or the accidental pushing of some of the pilgrims or the decision of some of the pilgrims to violate governmental guidelines and instructions. <br /><br />It may be that such accidents occur, not due to the oversight of the authorities, rather it be that Allaah, the Most High, has Decreed that He has Chosen for some of His Slaves to be taken as martyrs, taken in the best possible situation – in a virtuous place, whilst others sustaining injuries in which they may be heavily rewarded in enduring.<br /><br />Based on all of this, blaming the authorities who have put forth such an endeavor and have exceeded in its accomplishments is not acceptable. All of this just leads to resentment and others boastfully claiming a supposed superior degree of skillfulness.<br /><br />The implications of such negativity include a negation of reward for those who have been afflicted. Rather those who busy themselves in criticizing, only criticize with a worldly objective or in order to take advantage of some political gain.<br /><br />The Kingdom - and all Praises are due to Allaah - is more than able to manage the annual Hajj, without any need for assistance. It has been blessed by Allaah with a sovereignty that is led by the Custodian of the Two Noble Masjids. Its constitution is founded with the objective of governing under a Devine directive. The produce of such foundations has effected and continues to affect the two Holy Masjids.<br /><br />For instance, Allaah has Surrounded His House and His Slaves with peace and serenity during times in which the world is experiencing an increase intensity of chaos and disruption and being burnt from the fire of tribulations and war.<br /><br />And all Praises are due to Allaah, the One Who has enabled the truthful ones from His Slaves to protect His Religion and His Sanctified City. And by them, the Muslims and the lands are in turn protected.<br /><br />أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا آمِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ ۚ أَفَبِالْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَكْفُرُونَ<br />“Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then do they believe in falsehood and become ingrate for the Graces of Allah?” [al-‘Ankaboot 29: 67]<br /><br />Likewise we thank Allaah for His Bounty upon us in enabling us to complete the Hajj, catering for hundreds and thousands of pilgrims. Surely, we are saddened by the accidents that occurred yesterday (10/12/1436 - 24/9/15), a Decree of Allaah that effected some of the pilgrims - an incident which caused an unfortunate stampede in Minaa; but with this, we do not say anything except that Pleases our Lord, without gaining His Anger or displeasure in His Decree.<br /><br />It is imperative that we investigate the causes so that such accidents do not reoccur. Those who were negligent must be immediately held to account, so that the efforts of the hundreds within the task force are not undermined. They are those who have given all in order to serve the Guests of ar-Rahmaan and have shown extreme kindness to the pilgrims, being with them in every step of the Hajj. They have made the pathways safe to cross, they navigated the crowds, treated the sick, given direction to the lost, gave religious guidance to the ignorant, fed the hungry, quenched the thirsty and been of serviced to the helpless. These are those who have been at the forefront of appeasing the desperation of the pilgrims, thus being deserved of recognition, commendation and our supplication and beseechment to Allaah, the Glorified and the Exalted, for them. Their hard work is not hidden and most of it is clear for the people to witness. So may Allaah reward them and multiply their recompense.<br /><br />From the corruption of the adversary is that they use accidents and tribulations that befall the people, in a chance and an opportunity to raise doubts. They use it as propaganda to belittle the hard efforts of others.<br /><br />The whole world is witness to the remarkable endeavors and the substantial budget set aside for the Hajj. The Guests of ar-Rahmaan have been welcomed with by the organizers and the general public alike.<br /><br />However, they behave in this manner because in the absence of shame, morals cease to exist and one is led to act however he pleases. From the bitterest forms of satire is that they use the pilgrims and martyrs as pawns to lament their objective. <br /><br />Meanwhile, their history is full of atrocities committed within the Haram! They bombarded the Haram in Makkah, killed its worshippers and used explosives within the Haram itself. Despite being a holy sanctuary, they brought within it weapons, casted horror into the hearts of the pilgrims, and even threatened to take their lives and possessions. All of this to fulfill their ghastly objective - to try to prevent the people from performing the pilgrimage safely[1].<br /><br />What is strange is now they want to create manufactured tears in the name of the victims of these accidents.<br /><br />They display eagerness in protecting the blood of the pilgrims, despite the fact that they have funded tens of militia in Iraq, Yemen and Syria in order to kill thousands of innocent Muslims. They have driven out millions from their homes, and have gathered for themselves heavy artillery which they have now spread throughout the lands of the Muslims in order to kill them.<br /><br />They have instilled hate into the hearts of those who have been deceived by them.<br /><br />May Allaah Protect the Muslims from the evil of these people, and guide those who have been led astray and deluded by them.<br /><br />They are those who dance in the event of killing and injury, and are at the forefront of displaying joy and happiness when such incidents occur. They drop on the Muslims the veil of at-Taqiyyah[2], using it as propaganda to spread their doubts.<br /><br />Clear daylight is surely visible for those who see with both eyes[3], and those who have been given by Allaah the ability to fairly analyze the truth from falsehood.<br /><br />They scream desperately and their objectives are exposed. As every day goes by, they do not increase except in disgrace. No accident takes place except that they show mischief. Whenever something bad befalls the Muslims, they always welcome it with happiness and delight. They want sorrow to spread amongst the Arab lands and the Muslims as they want you to be suppressed.<br /><br />[Khutbah entitled Fadl al-Ayaam al-Ma’doodaat,11/12/1436 – 25/9/2015]<br /><br /><br /><br />[1] The Shaykh is referring to the attempted-hijacking of the Haram by Iran-led Shia’s in 1987. This began as a Shia protest but a confrontation with the Saudi authorities led to a stampede which killed over 400 people and injured thousands. Even more despicable is the action of the Qaraamitah (commonly known as Ismaeeli’s today), a Shia sect that stemmed from Koofah in 317AH. Its leader was a man named Sulaymaan bin al-Hasan al-Qarmitee that took over the Haram and killed the Hujjaaj whilst they were performing Tawaaf. They threw the dead bodies in the well of Zamzam and corrupted its water. But before that, on the eight day of Hajj they slaughtered the masses in Minaa on the 8thof Dhu al-Hijjah (the first day of Hajj) and called this an act of sacrifice. As they left, they stole the black stone and took it with them to Koofah. As the stone was being liberated by the following Caliphate that took power, they refused a hand over the stone and opted to smash the stone into pieces instead. [see al-Bidaayah 37/15-39]<br />[2] See here for more information on at-Taqiyyah:http://ahledhikr.blogspot.com/2015/04/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html<br />[3] A simile given by many of the scholars in reference to ad-Dajjaal. He is the impostor and only sees with one eye, as for the Muwaahid, he is able to see clearly with two eyes and is able to decipher the truth from falsehood by it.

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=52&amp;p=56#p56"><![CDATA[
This is Suroorism so Beware of it!<br /><br />AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee<br /><br />SOURCE: His book Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb ‘alaa As’ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 179-185)<br /><br />PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com<br /><br />Question: What is Suroorism and what are its clear signs. Is it real or just part of one’s imagination?<br /><br />Answer: All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah – alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. To proceed:<br /><br />Suroorism is an ascription to the brother Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen. He used to be in Kuwait where he came out with some good books in which he clarified the beliefs of the Shee’ah, as well as other good books. Then he moved to Germany and then to England where he eventually settled. There, he produced the Magazine entitled “Al-Bayaan” and we were extremely pleased with it. Then he produced another magazine called “As-Sunnah” and likewise we were extremely pleased with it. And we said: “This is the answer to what we have been waiting for.” And some of our brothers praised the magazine “Al-Bayaan” and even we praised it in the past, saying: “There cannot be found anything equal to it.” However the condition of the Hizbees is that in the beginning they call to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah until the people’s hearts grow attached to them and their strength increases. Then when they come to know that criticism against them will have no effect on them, they manifest what they are truly upon.<br /><br />The magazine “As-Sunnah”, of which it is more proper that it be called “Al-Bid’ah” calls people away from the scholars and it accuses them of being inactive, paid by the government and not having an understanding of current affairs.<br /><br />But all praise be to Allaah, the reality of the Surooris came out in the open during the Gulf Crisis. This was from the Grace of Allaah, ‘azza wa jall. I remember reading at that time some words (in their magazine) in which there was an attack against Shaikh Al-Albaanee for having produced a tape called: “An Encounter with a Suroori.” Then a few pages later they praised Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So I realized the significance of this praise – so that it won’t be said that: “They attack the scholars!”<br /><br />Some days after the fatwa of Shaikh Ibn Baaz concerning the permissibility of making a treaty with the Jews was issued, they launched an attack against Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So it was in fact a well-devised scheme to chase the people away from the scholars! And the magazines “Al-Bayaan” and “As-Sunnah” gave the understanding that it was more proper to refer to those Salafees who understood the current affairs in Yemen concerning the affair of the Yemeni Crisis.<br /><br />So I say: O you masaakeen [1]…who is it that is unaware of the condition of the Muslims? Rather, all of the matter lies in fixing this current situation we find ourselves in.<br /><br />So what has befallen the Muslims from losses, fear and suffering, then it is due to our sins. Allaah says: “Allaah puts forth the example of a town (Makkah) that dwelt in security and well-being; it’s provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it denied the Blessings of Allaah. So Allaah made them taste the extreme hunger (famine) and fear because of what they used to do.” [Surah An-Nahl: 112]<br /><br />So if we have come to realize the sickness, then what is the cure? Allaah says: “Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy (i.e. Khilaafah) in the land as he granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me.” [Surah An-Noor: 55]<br /><br />So it is the sins that have brought humiliation upon the Muslims. And it is their dealing with interest, their allowing of fornication in many of the Islamic lands and their preferring and submitting to man-made laws brought by way of the enemies of Islaam, and how much more can we list…and the going out without Hijaab and indecent exposure, and their mixing of the sexes in the schools and the universities.<br /><br />So the cure is in returning to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, and then by returning to the scholars. Allaah says: “And when there came to them a matter concerning (public) security or fear, they announced it to the people. But if only they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those encharged with authority amongst them, those who have the ability to derive a proper conclusion from it would have understood it.”[Surah An-Nisaa: 83]<br /><br />So it is an obligation on us to return to the scholars: “These are the parables that We send forth to the people, yet no one (truly) understands them except those with knowledge.” [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 43]<br /><br />But what you see is a person memorizing three or four subjects and then he takes that around to the masaajid, charging and ramming (like a bull). Then his companions nickname him Shaikh-ul-Islaam! So is this knowledge? Rather, knowledge is sitting upon a mat with your needs tucked below you (hearing from a shaikh) – enduring with patience the hardships of hunger and bareness. Just look at the condition of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and what they went through.<br /><br />And the people of knowledge, they are the ones who put each thing in it’s proper place, as was stated in the previous ayah. And Allaah says: “Verily, in that is a reminder to those who possess knowledge.” [Surah Ar-Room: 22]<br /><br />And Allaah says: “Is the one who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth then like he who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.” [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 19]<br /><br />The affliction that the Muslims are being tested by is their being ignorant about their Religion. So anyone that memorizes some ayaat and ahaadeeth and then begins to talk about it, especially if he has some eloquence in speech, people say: “This is a Shaikh.”<br /><br />All praise be to Allaah, the reality of the matter became clear, as it is said:<br /><br />“If you hear the eloquent one speaking, do not give yourself into him<br />For this unnatural (way of speaking) is something artificial<br />Be pleased with taking knowledge and understanding, and<br />His eloquent speech will come to an end without any fight.”<br /><br />And Allaah says when informing us of the story of Qaaroon: “So he (Qaaroon) went forth before his people in his arrogance. Those who are desirous of the life of this world said: ‘Ah, would that we had the like of what Qaaroon has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.’ But those who had been given knowledge said: ‘Woe to you! The reward of Allaah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient. So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allaah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. And those who had desired to have been in his position the day before, began to say: ‘Know you not that it is Allaah who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allaah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)!’ Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful?’” [Surah Al-Qasas: 79-82]<br /><br />So it is an obligation on us to return to the people of knowledge and to learn, just as when Jibreel went to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) to teach the Companions how to ask questions.<br /><br />And I will never forget what ‘Abdul-Qaadir Ash-Shaybaanee, the small ignoramus, said: “We will send some of our brothers to Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (i.e. Shaikh Muqbil) to get some gulps (of knowledge) in two months, and then we will send them to some of the centers to take over grounds from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen.” So I said: “In two months it’s possible to produce callers to Allaah?”<br /><br />So if it is the ignorant ones that are in charge of directing the Da’wah groups, then I give the tidings of the demise of such Da’wah groups. So we must gather with the scholars and take knowledge from them, as our scholars in the past did. Salmaan Al-Faarisee sat and sought knowledge with the first scholar he encountered until he died, and then a second and a third until he came upon the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and followed him. And this is how the companions of Mu’aadh (raa) were. Before he passed away, they said to him: “Who shall we go to (for knowledge after you)?” He said: “To ‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas’ood.”<br /><br />And when one of the brothers demands one of the Hizbees to seek knowledge, he says: “Amongst you are those who want this world and amongst you are those who want the Hereafter.”[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152] And then he says: “Allaah said this ayah with regard to the Companions” – meaning, they acknowledge that they have no patience in seeking knowledge and in suffering hunger. They prefer to live close to people in buildings and cars and in the worldly life.<br /><br />Then we hear them say: “You attack the different organizations.” So who told you that we attack the organizations? Yes, we attack some of the organizations that consist of partisanship, restricted Walaa (loyalty), thievery and misappropriation of money. These are the kinds of groups that we criticize and call the people away from.<br /><br />So this is a Da’wah (call) that is based on lies and deceptions, but the reality will become manifest. For the Da’wah of ‘Alee Ibn Al-Fadl manifested itself and the reality of the Da’wah of the Mu’tazilah, the Shee’ah and Sufis manifested themselves. And the ones who will expose and make these realities manifest, by the Permission of Allaah, are Ahlus-Sunnah.<br /><br />And all praise be to Allaah, Ahlus-Sunnah are the ones who always examine and rectify the Muslim ummah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “There will not cease to be a group from my ummah that is triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them until Allaah’s Command (i.e. Promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).”<br /><br />So Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him, in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd, is exposing the Hizbees and clarifying what beliefs they are upon. And likewise Shaikh Abul-Hasan in Ma’ribi[2] and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab in Hudaydah and Shaikh Muhammad Al-Imaam in Ma’bar and Shaikh Qaasim and the brother Muhammad As-Somalee in Jaami’-ul-Khair in San’aa.<br /><br />So I advise the brothers, because many of them all praise be to Allaah are receptive, to return to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and to call to them, and to not waste away their lives in glorifying Shaikh so and so. And if they were to abandon such sheikhs, they would say: “Beware of him, he is from Jamaa’at At-Takfeer” or “He is a government agent.” These are words of one who doesn’t fear Allaah.<br /><br />Footnotes:<br /><br />[1] Translator’s Note: This is the plural of the Arabic word miskeen, which means someone needy. In this context it refers to someone who is ignorant and lacking knowledge, thus being needy (of it).<br /><br />[2] Translator’s Note: It is important to note that this article appeared in the first edition (printed in the year 2000) of the book “Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb”. Since then, and after the passing away of Imaam Muqbil Al-Waadi’ee, the scholars have become aware of errors in creed and manhaj committed on the part of Abul-Hasan Al-Ma’ribee. So the likes of Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee, Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee and Shaikh ‘Ubayd Al-Jabiree refuted him and warned against him.<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/29/this-is-suroorism-so-beware-of-it-shaykh-muqbil-bin-haadee/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/29/t ... in-haadee/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/suroorism/">http://www.salafiri.com/suroorism/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 10:40 pm</p><hr />
