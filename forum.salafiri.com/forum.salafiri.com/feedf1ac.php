<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Deobandi’s and Black Magic</span></strong><br /><br />As other Sufis, many Deobandis are also involved in magic, and this shows that many of the Sufis so-called Tasarrufat (controls) and karamat are in fact the works of Jinns and they use magic and Jinns to fool people and make them think they have Karamat from Allah and many of their ignorant followers are deceived by this.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ashraf Ali Thanvi and magic to separate between two persons</span></strong><br /><br />Ashraf Ali Thanvi wrote a book called “A’mal e Qurani”, a book of invocations, Ta’wizat (Tamaim) and ‘Amaliyat (Sufi formulas).<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526718.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526718.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In this book, p 21, Thanvi told how to use some magic to separate between two persons: “(Allah said:) ”We have put hatred and animosity between them until the day of Resurrection”<br /><br />If you desire to separate and put hatred between two persons, write this verse on a Bhuj stone, then write (the picture):<br /><br />And below the picture write the sentence: may the separation occur between Fulan (so and so) and Fulan. Write the names of the two persons instead of Fulan, make a Ta’wiz (Tameemah) of it and bury it between two old graves , but don’t do it for people not deserving this, as it will be a sin.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526722.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526722.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can clearly see that the picture Ashraf Ali Thanvi told to write contains the words “Sihr” meaning magic, and learning magic is Kufr. The heart of the Muslim cries and gets a shock to see that such a Kufr is propagated under the name of Islam and Quran. And in this book, Ashraf Ali Thanvi gave other Ta’wizat to cure from some disease or to have a boy and these Ta’wizat contain numbers and unknown words, and this is also clear magic.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526721.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526721.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/19668720/320526719.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 526719.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to control the Humans and Jinns and possess the kingdom of Sulayman</span></strong><br /><br />The Deobandi book called “Jawahir Khamsah” is about Du’a, Ta’wizat and ‘Amaliyat. The author is Muhammad Ghawth Gulyari, and it has been translated from Persian by Mirza Muhammad Beg An-Naqshabani and it is published by famous Deobandi publisher of Karachi “Dar ul Isha’at”, and it is also published by another Deobandi publisher of Lahore “Maktabah Rehmaniyah”. At the end of this book, the Risalah “Futuh ul Ghayb” has been added.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301666627.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 666627.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In this book, the author teaches an invocation to possess the kingdom of Sulayman, control humans and Jinns: “Name 33 for greatness and control of humans and Jinns: “Ya Quddus Tahir min kuli Su fala Shayun Yu’azuhu min jami’ khalqihi” (O Quddus, pure from all evils, none can be protected in<br /><br />His whole creation). This composed name’s particularity is that whoever for Zahiri and Batini (apparent and interior) greatness, reads it ten thousands time fir forty days, will be cut from what is other than Allah, and all the creation including humans and Jinns will be under his control and obedience…and he will become the inheritor of the kingdom of Sulayman (aley salam)”…<br /><br />Also to possess the kingdom of Sulayman: whoever read this name for five years … (in a specific manner), he will have improvement in all of his works and the kingdom of Sulayman (aley salam) will come in his hands, and he will possess the control of the earth and the skies, and all the creation of the great and small universe will be under his control, and the whole universe will be enlightened by his benediction…even if he gives order, then the sun will appear in the night and disappear in the day”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671399.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671399.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can wonder is such things are possible then why did the Sahabah fought their enemies and some became martyrs? This kind of Tasawwud totally destroys the intelligence of its author, and they are totally lost in this world of hallucination and madness and accept any kind of fairy tale and nonsense. Allah created humans on pure Fitrah, but this wrong Sufism corrupted his Fitrah and made him accept such falsehood.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to the men of the invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb)</span></strong><br /><br />In the same book “Jawahir Khamsah” p 310 there is an invocation:<br />“Peace be upon you O men of the invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb) and noble souls, help us with your special help and look at us with your special looking, O Ruqaba, O Nuqaba, O Nujaba, O Bukhaba, O Abdal, O Awtad, O Aqtab, O Qutb al Aqtab help me in this matter…”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301666640.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 666640.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />About the invocation called ”Du’a Sayfi”, the author showed that it is finished with a table of numbers, and he does not know reality of it. So these people are writing numbers not knowing what they mean, they found this from Sufis.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301667637.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 667637.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />He also gave a circle of the men of invisible (Rijal ul Ghayb) which is at the end of this invocation:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301668325.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 668325.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And it has preceded that these people believe that these Awliya, Abdal and Qutb rule the world.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Writing Al-Fatihah in disorder</span></strong><br /><br />This book “Jawahir Khamsah” also tells to write Surah Al-Fatihah in disorder to cure from some diseases. And it is well known that this is pure magic and clear Kufr pleasing Jinns, as Shaykh ul Islam Ibn Taymiyah explained in his book “Furqan bayna Awliya Rahman wa Awliya Shaytan”.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301670464.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 670464.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Circles and crosses with strange words</span></strong><br /><br />This book also contains some pictures of crosses made with letters.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301670470.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 670470.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And there are strange circles with words like: Haqiqat Ism A’zam, Haqiqat Muhammad Haqiqi, ‘Alim Wahdat, ‘Alim Sifat, Arwah Maqam Haqiqat, Maqam Arwah.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669224.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669224.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669219.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669219.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There is also a circle containing 19 circles containing words such as: Soul (Ruh), secret (Sir), reason (‘Aql), imagination (Khyal), the heart (Qalb) and others.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301669221.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 669221.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And these terms are the Batini and Zahiri sense known to the Greek philosophers and used by Ibn Sina and then Sufis like Al-Ghazali and others.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Formula to kill someone</span></strong><br /><br />In “Futuh Ghayb” of Mirza Beg Naqshabandi published at the end of “Jawahir Khamsah” there is a formula telling us how to kill someone deserving death, not an innocent:<br /><br />“’Amal (Sufi formula) number ten: killing an enemy whose killing is permissible by the religious law. One should take and put a tree of Sanubar in an empty house, and he should write on it all the Great Names (of Allah) and if there is a group, then 48 times and if there are three then 27 times, and should do Dam (Ruqiyah) with the Great Names (of Allah) on the tree…and he should have no cloth on the head, and he should take a stick and imagine his<br />enemy then beat the Sanubar and say: “I have killed Fulan (so and so) with the domination of Allah (Jalla Jalaluhu)”. He should do such three or seven days.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671402.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671402.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One can wonder if such things were correct why the Sahabah and Salaf fought and got martyred. But this kind of Sufism is an opium which totally destroys the reason of the person who enters it. This person might be attracted by the stories softening the heart, but then he is brain washed and accepts magic and all these fairy tales containing abominable Kufr and Shirk<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Invocation to have the attributes of Allah</span></strong><br /><br />In the same “Futuh Ghayb”, there is an invocation for the purpose of possessing the<br />attributes of Allah:<br /><br />“If someone wants to enter the state of Fana fi Allah and Baqa bi Allah, and wants to possess the attributes of Jamal and Jalal of Haqq (Allah), and great subsistence and honour…and Ilm Ladduni (Sufi secret knowledge) and Kashf (unveiling) of hidden lights, then he should first fulfill the conditions of this name…then he should do Ghusl in one of the beginning day of the month, sing one or two songs for the soul of the leader of Prophets (saw) and read hundred times Darood Sharif, then he should start reciting this<br />name 2695 times in the day and night for forty days…”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9677484/17902368/301671400.jpg">http://pic60.picturetrail.com/VOL1773/9 ... 671400.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />May Allah protect us from such Kufr and Shirk.<br />May Allah send Salah and Salam on the Prophet (saw), his household, companions and those who follow them.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gift2deobandis.com/2013/05/20/the-creed-of-deobandi-elders-pdf/">https://gift2deobandis.com/2013/05/20/t ... lders-pdf/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Apr 13, 2017 11:41 pm</p><hr />
