Allegorical interpretation of Allaah’s attributes, such as His Throne;<br /><br />4. His declaration that there does not exist, in his time, a Muslim society on the face of the planet – a blanket declaration of apostasy of the Muslim world;<br /><br />5.

His distortion of the declaration of faith to mean that ‘there is here is no rulership except for that of Allaah’, rather than, ‘none has the right to be worshiped in truth but Allaah’.<br /><br />7. His rejection of affirming the ‘al-Akhabar al-Aahaad’ in creed, going against the position of the People of the Sunnah;<br /><br />8. Affirming some of the principles of socialism;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jan 30, 2017 12:59 am</p><hr />
