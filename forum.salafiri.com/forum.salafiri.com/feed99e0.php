<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">The Meaning of at-Tawheed - Part 1</span></span></strong><br /><br />Al-‘Allaamah ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Hasan aal ash-Shaykh [May Allaah have Mercy on him] (the grandson of Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdul-Wahaab) said:<br /><br />Ibn al-Qayyim [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The Tawheed that the Messengers (were sent with and) called to and  the Books that were revealed in explaining at-Tawheed, consists of two aspects;<br /><br />Tawheed in knowing Allaah and affirming what He has affirmed for himself (otherwise referred to the Oneness of a Lord and its characteristics that are specified to Him Alone, and the Oneness of His Names and Attributes; affirming them and not apply them to anyone else other than Him. These are known as Tawheed ar-Rooboobiyyah and Tawheed al-Asmaa’ wa as-Sifaat).<br /><br />Tawheed in seeking and in intention (otherwise known as Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah which is to worship Allaah Alone, the Most High).<br /><br />As for the first type then this includes affirming for your Lord, the Most High, what we have been informed about from the Names, the Attributes and the Actions that He Does. We affirm that all Decree, Predestination and Wisdom is for Him Alone. The Qur’aan is explicit in this and has gone into great detail in explaining it. There are many examples, for instance, Surah al-Ikhlaas, Surah Taha, the end of Surah al-Hashr, the beginning of Surah as-Sajdah and Surah aal-Imraan and others.<br /><br />The second type of Tawheed is found in Surah al-Kaafiroon, and also in the statement of Allaah, the Most High,<br /><br />“Say: &quot;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then, if they turn away, say: &quot;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&quot;” [aal-‘Imraan 3:64]<br /><br />In fact, the whole of the Qur’aan reflects and highlights this message. Every Surah from the Qur’aan stresses this very point.<br /><br />As a result, the Qur’aan either introduces Allaah, the Most High, by explaining to us His Names, Attributes and Actions or it explains that worship is for Him Alone, without any partners.<br /><br />Nevertheless, knowing these categories is not enough. The only way one can actualise at-Tawheed (the above information) in its totality is to complete his life by fulfilling the Commandments of Allaah upon him and staying away from what He has Prohibited.<br /><br />If one is able to do this then they have been honoured incalculably, something only given to those who (truly) believe in at-Tawheed. As a result of this (i.e. knowing Allaah through Tawheed and fearing Him by practising at-Taqwaa) they becoming elevated in the life of the Dunyaa and the Aakhirah, this is the repayment for having at-Tawheed.<br /><br />As for the people of Shirk then they are  disgraced and punished in the Dunyaa and the Aakhirah. There punishment is intensified and for them is the worst of punishments. This is the recompense for those who leave (understanding and implementing) Tawheed and (consequently) fall into Shirk.<br /><br />So the whole of the Quraan emphasises Tawheed, it’s meaning, its rights (upon us) and the resulting reward for those who actualise it. In contrast, it also warns against Shirk and the punishment for those who (believe and) live by it.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">[Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitaab at-Tawheed (Pg. 8)]</span></em></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-meaning-of-at-tawheed.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03 ... wheed.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Oct 18, 2016 10:56 pm</p><hr />
