				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Essence (Dhaat) of Allah</span></strong><br /><br />It is well-known that the <span style="color: #0000FF">Essence (Dhaat) of Allah</span> does not resemble that of the creation and that affirmation of Allah’s Essence does not necessitate that of the creation.<br /><br />So what necessitates Allah’s Attributes does not necessitate creation’s attributes, because there are matters that apply to the creation such as deficiency, poverty, humility and weakness, this does not apply to the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Beginner and Creator of everything whose Existence, Essence and Attributes are not encompassed by minds and are not comprehended by delusions and thoughts.<br /><br />Allah says,<br /><ul>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.”<br />{ash-Shooraa (42): 11}</ul><br />So Allah affirms for Himself hearing and seeing, what the creation are also described as having,<br />yet Allah negated from Himself having anything from the creation which is like unto Him. <br /><br />Allah says,<br /><ul>“Do you know of any similarity to Him?”<br />{Maryam (19): 65}</ul><br />And Allah says,<br /><ul>“Nor is there to Him any equivalent.”<br />{al-Ikhlaas (112): 4}</ul><br />Allah says,<br /><ul>“So do not assert similarities to Allah.”<br />{an-Nahl (16): 74}</ul><br />Allah says,<br /><ul>“So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].”<br />{Baqarah (2): 22}</ul></div>
