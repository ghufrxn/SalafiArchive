The Ruling of Committing Suicide &amp; Not Having Patience Upon Trials<br />By Shaykh, Allaama, Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz Rahimahullaah [1420H]<br /><br />Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />‘If a person commits suicide due to the circumstances of life and what he experiences of hardships of living and spending upon his family, would this mean that, that person will stay in Hell-fire?’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh -Rahimullaah- answered:</span></strong><br /><br />‘All praise be to Allaah, Sallat and Sallam be upon the Messenger of Allaah.<br /><br />To proceed:<br /><br />Suicide is a great evil, and it is a sin from the major sins.  It is not permissible for a Muslim to commit Suicide.<br /><br />Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:<br /><br /><em><ul>&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. &gt;&gt; 4:29</ul></em><br /><br />The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said in an authentic hadeeth:<br /><br /><em><ul>‘Whoever commits suicide using something then he will be punished using that thing on the Day of Judgement.’</ul></em><br /><br />What is obligatory upon a believer is that he forces himself to have patience and resilience if a catastrophe befalls him and he endures difficulties in his Dunyaa matters.  He should not be hasty in committing suicide, rather he should be warned against that, and fear Allaah, and he should be patient and utilize the means to keep away from committing suicide, and whoever fears Allaah then Allaah will make a way out for him.<br /><br />If a person commits suicide then he risks the Anger of Allaah and His punishment, and that person is under the Will of Allaah, this is because committing suicide is less than Shirk.<br /><br />Allaah –Subhanahu – said:<br /><br /><em><ul>&lt;&lt; Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. &gt;&gt; 4:48</ul></em><br /><br />Therefore, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">whatever is less than Shirk then it is under the Will of Allaah</span></strong>, and committing suicide is less then Shirk, likewise is Zina (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.  All of these things are sins that are less than Shirk, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.  If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah – Subhanahu – if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.<br /><br />Then after he is purified and cleared he will be taken out of the Fire, and according to the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">he will not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity</span></strong>. A sinner will not stay in the Fire for eternity, nor will a murderer, nor any other sinner, however if Allaah wants He will give him His punishment.  Allaah punishes whomsoever He wills in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of that person’s sins, then Allaah takes him out of the Fire to a river, which is called, the river of life, and he is planted there just like a seed is planted and grows on the sides of the banks of a torrential river. When that person’s growth has been completed, then Allaah enters him into Paradise due to his Islaam and his Eemaan upon which he dies. Only the disbeliever will stay in the Fire for eternity, only the disbelieving Mushrikoon (polytheists) those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messenger, or those that belie Allaah’s Messengers, or that reject what Allaah’s Messengers brought, or other things similar to these of disbelief.<br /><br />As for the sinner, then according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah he will not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, and this is in contrast to the position of the Khawarij and the Mu’atazilah.<br /><br />Indeed groups from the Khawarij and Mu’atazilah – and they are two misguided groups – say that a sinner will stay in the Hell-Fire forever, if he enters it!  And this is a grave mistake.<br /><br />As for the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah, and they are the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible.  However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and Eemaan and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.<br /><br />There are many reoccurring Ahadeeth from the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– about this point, namely that some people will enter the Fire due to their sins then Allaah will take them out of the Fire due to the intercession of the intercessors, or with Allaah’s mercy without anyone’s intercession, and all of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’<br /><br />Taken from: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/home/?p=98%5D">http://www.sahab.net/home/?p=98%5D</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/the-ruling-of-committing-suicide-not-having-patience-upon-trials/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... on-trials/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2017 11:15 pm</p><hr />
