It is not hidden from the salafees of the West that for some time now there has been a very relaxed approach in the affairs of dawah, especially, in calling to the pure, unadulterated and unblemished dawah.<br /><br />Of course, when one considers in depth the reason for the weakening and disunity of the salafees generally and in the west specifically, then there are many reasons as to why we have fallen from the peak all the way down! No doubt, becoming weak in taqwa, aqeedah and manhaj amongst many other matters come to mind as the foundational reasons for where we find ourselves today.<br /><br />However, the purpose of this risaalah is not to list and discuss all the various factors that have made us fall to new depths but to consider carefully one factor which some may say is the single most considerable matter that has led to the salafee and his dawah suffering, that is leaving the door open for ahl ul bidah to enter our masaajid and thus our hearts!<br /><br />Hence the title of this risaalah is a metaphorical one, in that, we must never allow ourselves to be influenced by ahl ul bidah and all that they call to from wretchedness and deviation. Allahs aid is sought.<br /><br />Let us consider some principles that ought to be the cornerstone of the salafee yet we have shamelessly deemed fit to move away from light toward darkness in our manhaj.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not-drink-o-salafi-from-the-well-in-which-their-is-impurity/">http://www.salafiri.com/treatise-do-not ... -impurity/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:57 am</p><hr />
