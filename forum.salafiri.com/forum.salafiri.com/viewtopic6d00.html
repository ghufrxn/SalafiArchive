				<div class="content">To His Eminence, Shaykh `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, President of the Departments of Scholarly Research, Ifta’, Daw‘ah, and Guidance, may Allah protect him.<br /><br />As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)<br /><br /><em>Please advise me by giving me a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) as to whether it is permissible to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the known categories of Zakah recipients, in the same way as it is done inside the Kingdom. We appreciate your assistance and may Allah protect you. Wa‘alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (And may Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon you!)</em><br /><br />A question asked to His Eminence. He replied on 3/9/1410 A.H.<br /><br />It is permissible for the Zakah payer to send Zakah to a country other than where they are living, if this is for a Shar'y (Islamically lawful) benefit, according to the more correct of the two opinions held by the scholars, such as<br /><br />sending it to the Mujahidun (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah),<br />to the poor who are in greater need than those in their country, or<br />for being their relatives, as this combines maintaining the ties of kinship and Zakah.<br />May Allah guide everyone to that which pleases Him.<br /><br />As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.<br /><br /><strong><em>President of the Departments of Scholarly Research, Ifta’, Da‘wah and Guidance<br />`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</em></strong><br /><br />Source: alifta.net</div>
