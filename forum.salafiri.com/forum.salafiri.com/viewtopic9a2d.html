Sufism is an innovation, it is not from Islam.<br /><br />Thus it is upon those who have fallen into Sufism to repent to Allah the Exalted.<br /><br />And it is upon them to return to the Sunnah.<br /><br />And it is upon them to return to that which the pious predecessors were upon from uprightness and firmness upon the Deen of Allah and following the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and following the rightly guided successors.<br /><br />This is the pure unadulterated methodology.<br /><br />The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon him said:<br /><br /><ul>This nation will divide into seventy three sects all of them will be in the fire except one. They said: Who are they oh Messenger of Allah? He replied: Those who are upon what I and my companions are upon.</ul><br />Thus there is no safety and security except by following the Minhaj of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings are upon, him and his companions.<br /><br />And Sufism is not from the Minhaj of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah are upon him, and it is not from the Minhaj of his companions, and it is not from the Minhaj of the virtuous generations; rather it is something newly invented in Islam.<br /><br />And it (Sufism) contains a great deal of deviations; some of which contains grave worship and shirk with Allah the Exalted and belief in the dead.<br /><br />Thus Sufism also contains polytheism.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Link to audio:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/sufism-is-not-from-islam-explained-by-shaykh">http://mtws.posthaven.com/sufism-is-not ... -by-shaykh</a><!-- m --></div>
