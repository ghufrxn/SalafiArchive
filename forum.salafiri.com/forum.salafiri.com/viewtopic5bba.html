She is not a virgin and has previously been married.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />If the affair is as you have mentioned, then this last marriage of hers is not valid. That is because from the conditions of marriage is that both parties are pleased with the marriage. The non-virgin cannot be forced by her father (to marry) if she is over nine years old without (there being) any difference (on this issue among the scholars).<br /><br /><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aal us-Shaykh</strong><br /><em>Fataawaa wa Rasaa'il Vol. 10 page 84</em><br /><br />Translated by Abu Hakeem Bilal Davis<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=488">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=488</a><!-- m --></div>
