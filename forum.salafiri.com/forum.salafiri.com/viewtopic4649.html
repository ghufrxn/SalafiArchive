Introduction by Shaykh Abdur-Razaaq al-Afeefi<br />2. The Fatwaa of Shaykh Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir as-Sa'di - The Ruling concerning Smoking Cigarettes<br />3. The Approbation of Abdul-Lateef bin Ibraaheem Aal-ish-Sheikh<br />4. The Approbation of Sheikh Abdul-Muhaymin Abu Samh<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Introduction</span><br />All praises are due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.<br /><br />Verily the scholars in our time are many, but few are those who seek to extract rulings from its source and base them upon its foundation, follow their speech with action, and intently search for the truth in all that appears and rises from the horizon. And from this very few was Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir bin Sa’di, may Allah have mercy upon him, for indeed if anyone were to pursue his works, interact with him and examine his lifestyle in the days he was alive, he would know his perseverance in the service of knowledge, whether it be in research or commentary. He would find him excellent in character, upright in his affairs, and just and fair to his colleagues and students, pursuing harmony in any evil that might transpire and lead to contention and division, may Allah have much mercy on him.<br /><br />And from those works is this concise but comprehensive letter which he wrote in response to a question asked by the respected brother, Ali al-Hamd as-Saalihi in regards to the ruling regarding smoking cigarettes. In spite of its brevity, it has clearly achieved its goal, openly professing the truth. By it, the criterion has been established upon the obstinate and those who follow their desires rather than Guidance from Allah, as he employed the generality of the texts from the Qur'an and the Sunnah as a basis to give evidence to the prohibition of smoking cigarettes, as well as the detriment caused to one’s financial condition, body, and the society as a whole.<br /><br />And it is not for anyone to be obstinate by demanding to mention specific evidences prohibiting smoking, not being content in the generality of the texts, except if he be short-sighted, weak in intellect, and ignorant of the sources of the religion and how to understand and benefit from them. Indeed the evidences in the religion, as they appear as specific rulings, often appear as general rulings that embody the specific ones. The likes of these doubts and misconceptions do not cross the path of those who truly seek and research the truth. One would only use this type of reasoning if its addiction has taken possession of his soul and overcome him, in that he becomes its prisoner. Shaytaan seduces him, beautifying for him the khabaa'ith, revering it; he takes Shaytaan as an Imaam, leading the person’s heart astray by the whispers and doubts that he casts into it.<br /><br />It has become evident that smoking cigarettes contains much danger and much harm, and scholars of medicine have confirmed this fact. I will mention some of what they have said, not, though, to seek to establish its prohibition through it, for the one content in the religion is the one whom Allah has sufficed with His Book and the Prophet’s (ﷺ) Sunnah, for they are the clearest and straightest of paths and in them is the convincing argument for those who Allah has granted straightness and who are upon His Guidance. I only mention it for those who blindly follow whom they deem people of knowledge, civilization, and taste, seeking to clarify that the ones whom they emulate have themselves acknowledged its harm and repudiate it.<br /><br />The following are some excerpts taken from Kitaab-ul-Bayaan, by Sheikh Ibraaheem Abdul-Baaqi, may Allah have mercy on him. The Doctor stated in Adaab al-Muhallaa, p.122:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Tobacco and Smoking</span><br /><br /><em>by Western Health investigative officer Ismaa’eel Rushdie</em>:<br /><br />It is a plant the Arabs named, at-Tabaaq (tobacco). By chemical analysis, it is shown to contain a poisonous substance of which if two drops were to be administered to a dog’s mouth, it would immediately die, and five drops are sufficient to kill a camel.<br /><br />Savage people in the past were accustomed to chewing it. This is the most harmful method of utilization, for it enters the stomach through the saliva. In spite of the wide array of harm it causes, its consumption has become prevalent amongst many nations.<br /><br />Physicians have established that tobacco affects the heart by causing palpitation, the lungs by causing cough, the stomach by causing a loss of appetite, the eyes by causing conjunctivitis, and the nervous system by sedating it.<br /><br />Doctor Damardaash Ahmad stated the following:<br /><br />“And I do not find in the faults of people a fault,<br /><br />Like the shortcomings found in the competent of perfection.”<br /><br />I do not believe that the human race , since the time of its creation, has weakened and humiliated itself in front of its enemy as much they have in front of smoking cigarettes, as this habit has captivated, fettered and humiliated its pride. It has taken control of all types of people , from the most menial of labourers who depredate their own and their family’s nourishment, to the leading physicians, philosophers, and intellectuals who have annulled their ingeniousness with which they revealed distant horizons in an array of arts and sciences.<br /><br />The prevalent opinion was that smoking in moderation caused little or no harm to the healthy person, but ongoing research has established that in fact the harm caused by smoking is something that could n ever have been imagined.<br /><br />The realities of what this research has established the following Professor Diamond Palmer undertook a study of twenty thousand cases, amongst them were those who smoke excessively, moderately, and those that abstain from smoking altogether. He created a profile at John Hopkins University stating in it everything related to their health, disease and lifestyles. He started the research in the year 1919 CE and completed it in the year 1940 CE with the following conclusion:<br /><br />Smoking cigarettes clearly shortens the lifespan of a person in relation to the amount consumed; those who refrain live longer than those who are moderate smokers, and those who smoke moderately live longer than those do so excessively.<br /><br />I ask Allah (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) that He guide us to the straight path, and that He grant us the guidance to accept advice , and that He keep us away from all which contains danger and harm. We ask that He have mercy upon the author, cause benefit by his work, and cause us to meet in the most honourable abode.<br /><br />And may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions.<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">Abdur-Razzaaq al-Afeefi.</span></em><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Ruling Concerning Cigarettes</span></span></strong><br /><br />This following is a letter from his excellency, the Sheikh, Abdur- Rahmaan an-Naasir as-Sa’di, may Allah have mercy upon him, which he wrote in reply to a question which I inquired due to a discussion that took place between me and another Muslim regarding the ruling concerning smoking. And as it was that this treatise was not to be found with any other person, I thought it necessary that I bring to it light, fearing the disgrace and sin associated with concealing knowledge, as well as hoping from Allah that he causes me, the author and the rest of the Muslims to benefit by it.<br /><br />The following is the text of the question and answer as written by the transcriber, may Allah have mercy on him.<br /><br /><img src="../upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Bismillah_Calligraphy4.svg/498px-Bismillah_Calligraphy4.svg.png" class="postimage" alt="Image" /><br /><br />From: Your son, ‘Ali bin Hamd as-Saalihi<br /><br />To: His Excellency, the noble Sheikh, Abdur-Rahmaan an-Naasir as-Sa’di.<br /><br />As-Salamu alaykum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakaatuhu:<br /><br />I ask that you bring us benefit by explaining in a clear fashion the ruling concerning smoking cigarettes and its commerce, is it haraam or makrooh[1]? Please provide us with a verdict.<br /><br />The Answer:<br /><br />And with Allah is Tawfeeq; we ask that He guide us and our brother Muslims.<br /><br />Smoking cigarettes, its trades and collaboration in it in any means is strictly prohibited. It is not permissible for a Muslim to endeavour in it, whether by smoking it or in its commerce, and it is obligatory upon the person who does, to turn to Allah in sincere repentance, as it is obligatory to repent from all other sins. This is due to the fact that it is inclusive of the general texts that prohibit it, through its general diction and meaning. This prohibition is by account of the harm it causes to one’s religion, well-being, and financial condition, and anyone of these reasons is enough to account for its prohibition.<br /><br />As for the harm it causes to one’s religion and the textual evidences regarding its prohibition, they can be approached from different respects.<br /><br />From the evidences is His (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) saying,<br /><br />“And He prohibits them al-khabaa'ith.”<br />[Surah al-A’raaf (7):157]<br /><br /><br /><br />And His (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) saying,<br /><br />“And do not cast yourselves into destruction with your own hands.”<br />[Surah al-Baqarah (2):195]<br /><br /><br /><br />And His (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) saying,<br /><br />&quot;And do not kill yourselves, verily Allah is to you Ever- Merciful.”<br />[Surah an-Nisaa' (4):29]<br /><br /><br /><br />Through these aforementioned ayaat and others similar in meaning, Allah prohibited all things that are khabeeth and cause detriment, and khubth and detriment are determined from the effect and harm that ensues from them. Cigarettes have many adverse effects that all people are well aware of, especially those who indulge in it, but their will power is decrepit; though they realize its harm, their desires take the better of them. Scholars have stated that all food and drink that is harmful is in fact prohibited.<br /><br />From the harm that it causes to one’s religion is that it becomes difficult for the servant to perform acts of worship and fulfil what he is ordered, especially in regards to the fast, and whatever causes aversion of good deeds is in itself evil. Smoking also encourages one to associate with the vile rather than the righteous. This is one of its greatest detriments, for it results in enmity and hatred of the righteous and dissuasion from following their way of life. And this is especially the case with children and young adults, for when they are afflicted with this trial; they immediately spiral into an ugly state of affairs. Cigarettes further the destruction of their character, and it becomes a door that leads to great evil.<br /><br />As for the detriment it causes the body, it is quite substantial, for it diffuses through the veins and makes its way to the whole body. It weakens the eyesight; it weakens the body’s vitality, and prevents the body to properly benefit from nutrition. Whenever these two characteristics are found simultaneously, it intensifies the severity of its danger.<br /><br />From its harmful effects is that it weakens the heart, interferes in the proper function of the nervous system, and causes loss of appetite. It also causes severe cough that may even lead to loss of breath and suffocation, and how many victims has it appropriated and led to destruction!<br /><br />Qualified physicians have resolved that smoking is the greatest cause of chest related diseases, like tuberculosis and its counterparts. It also has an observed effect of causing cancer, which is from the most severe and painful of diseases.<br /><br />It is so very strange that we see that intelligent people who are intent in preserving their health persist in smoking, when all these multitude of effects have been observed. And how many harmless ailments have deteriorated on its account and become difficult for physicians to cure. And how many people have quickly degenerated from a state of strength and health!<br /><br />And what is also very strange is that many people follow the advice of physicians in matters much less severe than this. How can they take this dangerous matter so lightly?! This is certainly due to them submitting to their desires which take control of their resolution, weakness in their determination to strengthen it, and giving precedence to their lifestyle, even after knowing its many harms.<br /><br />And it is not strange to see that many physicians also smoke, while they admit with their own statements their condition and its detriment to their health, for their addiction takes control over their intellect and determination; even though they perceive well its harm, they are still persistent in it.<br /><br />We have merely hinted at some of the harmful effects associated with smoking, along with the fact that it causes black staining of the mouth, lips and tongue, and causes rapid decay and rotting of the teeth.<br /><br />It also causes an array of inflammatory diseases, and if one were to research its harm, he would find much more than what we have mentioned.<br /><br />As for the detriment it causes to one’s financial condition, it has been authentically reported of the Prophet (ﷺ),<br /><br />“That he prohibited the squandering of money.”<br /><br />And what could possibly be more wasteful than burning it in these cigarettes that, “neither nourish nor avail against hunger,”[2] and contain no benefit in any respect. Those preoccupied in smoking bear much pain in spending large amounts of money on it, up to the point that they might even stop spending in that which is obligatory upon them. This is indeed a great misguidance and causes much harm. Spending money in that which has no benefit is prohibited, so how as for spending on that whose detriment is realized?<br /><br />Due to the fact that these cigarettes bring harm to one’s religion, body, and financial condition, its commerce is also haraam, and it is something futile, not profitable. Many people have witnessed that those who were involved in its commerce, even if they profited when they first started their business, they were afflicted by loss of wealth in the end. And verily the people of Najd, and all praise is due to Allah, all of its scholars are in agreement concerning its prohibition, and the lay people are enjoined to follow the scholars. It is not allowed for them to follow their desire, twist meanings or give reason that there are scholars from other lands that state its permissibility and not its prohibition. This type of reasoning is not allowed by the ijmaa’[3] of the scholars, for the lay people must follow their scholars; they are not independent of them. It is not allowed for them to disregard the statements of their scholars, and this is what is incumbent upon them, as Allah (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) says in the Qur'an,<br /><br />“Then ask the people of the Reminder (the scholars) if you do not know.”<br />[Surah al-Anbiyaa' (21):7]<br /><br />And there is no equal to this corrupt reasoning which is prominent on the tongues of some lay people out of their following of their desires and not truth and guidance, except if they were to say, “There are some scholars in the other lands that do not state the obligation of itmi'naan[4] in the prayer, so do not object to us if we follow them,” or, “There are some who state the permissibility of usury, so it is our choice whether we are to follow them or not,” or, “There are those who do not state the prohibition of eating birds which have talons, so it is our choice whether we are to follow them.” If this door is opened, much evil would be made accessible to people, and it would because of the disintegration of the religion. Everyone knows that following statements such as these are in direct conflict with what is well established in the religion and with the statements of the scholars, and that they are from those things which are impermissible.<br /><br />The correct means of assessment is through the fundamentals and principles of the religion, and they confirm the impermissibility of cigarettes. This is due to the many different harmful effects which result. Anything that induces harm upon a servant, whether in his religion, body, or financial condition, and has no realized benefit is prohibited. How much more is the case if there were countless harms all found in one entity? Isn’t it then deserving, religiously, intellectually, and medically, that it be left and cautioned against, and that advice should be given to those who accept it?<br /><br />It is incumbent upon those who are sincere to themselves and give their body worth and value, that they turn to Allah in forgiveness, and that they make a firm resolution without hesitation coupled with seeking help from Allah, for whoever does that, Allah will help them and make it easy for them to accomplish what they desire.<br /><br />What facilitates this is in knowing that whoever leaves something for Allah, He replaces it with something better. Also, as the reward of acts of obedience that are difficult to perform is much greater than those in which there is no hardship, the same applies for abandoning sins which are difficult to leave. So whoever is granted the Guidance and the Help of Allah, then he will find that he will only face difficulty in the beginning stages, but then it is gradually alleviated, until Allah completes His favour upon His servant and he rejoices at the Favour of Allah and His Protection and Help. He becomes sincere to his brothers as he was sincere to himself, and Tawfeeq (Success from Allah) is in the Hand of Allah. And who ever knows Allah from his heart and sincerely seeks that which is with Him by doing what he has ordered and leaving what he is prohibited, Allah will make the path to Jannah (Paradise) and all other good easy for him, and He will distance him from the Hellfire. So we ask Allah that he lead us to the good, and that He protect us from evil, verily He is Most Generous, Loving and Merciful.<br /><br />Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir as-Sa’di<br />Rabi’-ul-Awwal, 1376AH<br /><br />Transcribed by: Ali al-Hamd as-Saalihi.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Footnotes</span></span></strong><br /><br />1. Makrooh: As established in Usool-ul-Fiqh (fundamentals of jurisprudence), is that deed which is rewarded if left, with no punishment if done.<br /><br />2. In allusion to Surah al-Ghaashiyah (88):7<br /><br />3. Ijmaa': The consensus of the scholars which is considered a legislative proof by the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ). &quot;My nation (ummah) will never come together upon misguidance.&quot;<br /><br />4. Itmi'naan: The state of being at ease in each of the pillars of the prayer, so as to allow the bones to settle in their original position before continuing on to the next pillar.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Approbation of Abdul-Lateef bin Ibraaheem Aal-ish-Sheikh</span></span></strong><br /><br />(Director of Institutes and Faculties)<br /><br />All Praises are due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be on the noblest of prophets and messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his family, companions, and those who followed them in their way.<br /><br />I have reviewed what al-Allaamah ash-Sheikh Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir as-Sa’di has written in response to the questioner who inquired about the ruling concerning smoking cigarettes and its commerce. I found that he responded in a correct and beneficial manner, and that he elucidated the response in a clear and apparent style with authentic evidences from the Mighty Qur'an, the Prophetic Sunnah, and from the sayings of the scholars which enlighten the heart, exposing the harm it causes to one’s physical and spiritual life as well as what is associated with it from squandering money and loss of respect amongst people. And he also clarified the prohibition of its consumption and commerce, and that it is established by the consensus of the scholars. May Allah reward, forgive, and have mercy on him.<br /><br />Orated by: Abdul-Lateef bin Ibraaheem Aal-ish-Sheikh.<br /><br />And may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Approbation of Sheikh Abdul-Muhaymin Abu Samh</span></span></strong><br /><br />(Imaam Al-Masjidal- Haraam)<br /><br />Bismillah ar-Rahmaan ar-Raheem, and may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon our leader Muhammad, who said:<br /><br />“I have not left anything that draws one near to Allah except that I have clarified and ordered it, and I have not left anything that distances one from Allah except that I have clarified it and prohibited it, so whatever I have ordered you, do as much as you are able, and whatever I have prohibited, cease in it.”<br /><br />…or it’s like.<br /><br />I have heard the response of Sheikh Abdur-Rahmaan bin as-Sa’di, may Allah have mercy upon him and forgive him, in the ruling regarding smoking cigarettes. The truth is that it is a concise but beneficial response, and if a person wished to speak in its regard in more length than the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy upon him, he would find much to speak about and many evidences which pertain to it, like his (ﷺ) saying:<br /><br />“The children of Adam will not proceed on the Day of Resurrection until they are held accountable for their youth and strength and in what it was utilized, their time and how they consumed it, their wealth and how they spent it and from where they acquired it.”<br /><br />....or as Allah (The Mighty &amp; Majestic) said,<br /><br />“And eat and drink, but do not be excessive, verily Allah dislikes the excessive.”<br />[Surah al-A’raaf (7):31]<br /><br />This ayah is in regards to the permissible in which there is no doubt, so how would it be for that which the textual and intellectual evidences strengthen each other in implying its prohibition, along with what it constitutes from bad odour, loss of appetite, sterility, deterioration of health, and many other things of its like!!!<br /><br />Orated by: Abdul-Muhaymin Abu Samh, Imaam of Masjid al- Haraam.<br /><br /><br />Download PDF version from here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64xydvec0paqsol/AADPUa5UqLc5Tzb80xvTFwzRa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64xydvec0paq ...
