<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Qur’aan on Following the Sunnah</span></strong><br /><em>Prepared by Aboo Shaybah</em><br /><br />A collection of aayaat from the Qur’aan which command obeying the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) and outline the rewards entailed from doing so, as well as aayaat which warn against following a course other than that of the Messenger (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) and outline the adverse outcome of doing so. Some aayaat also explain that the Messenger’s (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wassallam) teachings are revelation from Allaah, and that following him amounts to obeying Allaah.<br /><br />The interested reader is advised to refer to the Tafseer of these aayaat for further edification.<br /><br />“Say: If you love Allaah, then follow me. If you do so, Allaah will love you and forgive your sins for you. And Allaah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):31]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: Obey Allaah and the Messenger. But if they turn away, then Allaah does not love the ungrateful disbelievers.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):32]</ul><br />“And obey Allaah and the Messenger so that you may be granted mercy.” [Aali ‘Imraan (3):132]<br /><br /><ul>“Those are the bounds set by Allaah. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted to jannaat under which rivers flow to dwell there eternally, and that is the supreme success. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and transgresses His bounds shall be placed in the hellfire to dwell there eternally, and he shall have a humiliating punishment.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):13-14]</ul><br />“O you who have eemaan! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. If you differ over anything, refer it to Allaah and the Messenger if you truly have eemaan in Allaah and the Last Day. That is best and most suitable for settlement. Have you not seen those who claim to have eemaan in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They desire to refer judgement to false judges although they were ordered to reject them; and shaytaan wishes to lead them far astray.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):59-60]<br /><br /><ul>“Therefore, no! By your Lord, they cannot have eemaan until they appoint you as judge in all<br />which they dispute, then not find any objection within themselves to what you decide, and they accept it with full submission.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):65]</ul><br />“And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger, they shall be in the company of those upon whom Allaah has bestowed His favour – among the Prophets, the steadfast upon the truth, the martyrs, and the righteous – and what excellent company they are.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):69]<br /><br /><ul>“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the people of eemaan, We shall leave him on what he has chosen, and We will make him taste hell – an evil destination indeed.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):115]</ul><br />“Whatever good reaches you is from Allaah, and whatever evil afflicts you is from yourself. And We have sent you to mankind as a Messenger, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. And whoever obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed Allaah; but as for those who turn away, We have not sent you over them as a guardian.” [an-Nisaa’ (4):79-80]<br /><br /><ul>“And obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, but be warned. And if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to clearly convey the message.” [al-Maa’idah (5):92]</ul><br />“And this is My straight path, so follow it; and do not follow the other paths because they will separate you from His path. That is what He has ordained for you in order for you to attain taqwaa.” [al-An‘aam (6):153]<br /><br /><ul>“O you who have eemaan! Answer Allaah and His Messenger when he calls you to what gives you life. And know that Allaah intervenes between and man and his heart, and that to Him you shall be gathered.” [al-Anfaal (8):24]</ul><br />“And obey Allaah and His Messenger, and do not dispute with each other lest you meet failure and your strength depart. And patiently persevere; indeed, Allaah is with those who patiently persevere.” [al-Anfaal (8):46]<br /><br /><ul>“The people of eemaan – men and women alike – are allies to one another. They command the good, forbid the evil, establish the prayer, pay the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. It is they whom Allaah will grant His mercy. Indeed, Allaah is Almighty, All-Wise.” [at-Tawbah (9):71]</ul><br />“With clear signs and revealed books. And We revealed to you the thikr so that you clearly explain to people what has been sent down to them, and that they might contemplate.” [an-Nahl (16):44]<br /><br /><ul>“And they say, ‘We have eemaan in Allaah and the Messenger, and we obey,” but then a group of them turn away afterwards. Those are not people of eemaan.” [an-Noor (24):47]</ul><br />“The statement of the people of eemaan, when they are called to Allaah and His Messenger, is only that they say, ‘We hear and we obey.’ They are the successful ones. And anyone who obeys Allaah and His Messenger, fears Allaah, and observes taqwaa of Him – those are the victorious.” [an-Noor (24): 51-52]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: obey Allaah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for the duty given to him, and you are only responsible for the duty given to you. And if you obey him, you shall be guided. And the Messenger has no duty except to clearly convey the message.” [an-Noor (24):54]</ul><br />“Do not call out to the Messenger the way you call out each other. Allaah already knows which of you slips away concealed by others. Thus, let those who oppose his command beware lest strife befall them or they are afflicted by an excruciating punishment.” [an-Noor (24):63]<br /><br /><ul>“And the day when the oppressor shall bite at his hands he will say, ‘If I had only taken a path with the Messenger.’” [al-Furqaan (25):27]</ul><br />“It is not fit for someone of eemaan – man or woman – to exercise their own choice when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.” [al-Ahzaab (33):36]<br /><br /><ul>“Verily, those who abuse Allaah and His Messenger, Allaah has cursed them in this world and the hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating torment.” [al-Ahzaab (33):57]</ul><br />“On the day when their faces will be turned about in the hellfire they will say, ‘If we had only obeyed Allaah and obeyed the Messenger.’”[al-Ahzaab (33):66]<br /><br /><ul>“O you who have eemaan! Observe taqwaa of Allaah and speak what is correct. If you do so, He will rectify your deeds and forgive your sins for you. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has achieved a tremendous accomplishment.” [al-Ahzaab (33):70-71]</ul><br />“O you who have eemaan! Do not put anything before Allaah and His Messenger. And observe taqwaa of Allaah. Indeed, Allaah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.” [al-Hujuraat (49):1]<br /><br /><ul>“Your companion has neither strayed nor erred. And he does not speak of his own desire; it is nothing other than revelation revealed to him.” [an-Najm (53):2-4]</ul><br />“Whatever spoils taken from the inhabitants of the villages without combat that are granted by Allaah to His Messenger – they are for Allaah, His Messenger and relatives, the orphans, the needy, and the stranded wayfarer, so that it would not become wealth distributed between the rich among you. And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids you from, refrain. And Observe taqwaa of Allaah. Indeed, Allaah is severe in punishment.” [al-Hashr (59):7]<br /><br /><ul>“Say: none can ever protect me from Allaah, and I can never find refuge in other than Him; I merely notify on behalf of Allaah and convey His messages. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger shall surely have the fire of hell, dwelling there eternally.” [al-Jinn (72):22-24]</ul><br />Source &amp; Arabic: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Mar 07, 2017 12:49 am</p><hr />
