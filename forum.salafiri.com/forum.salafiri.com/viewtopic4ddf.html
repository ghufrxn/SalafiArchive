And (ii) they denote an Attribute ‘Mercy’, which is derived directly from them through implication. And (iii) other Attributes which are not derived directly from these Names but through that which they necessitate like ‘Life’ and ‘Supreme Power’, and so on with all the other Names.<br /><br />And that is unlike the creation since a person may be named Hakeem (wise) and yet he is ignorant, and Hakam (just) and yet he is an oppressor, and ‘Azeez (mighty) and yet he is humiliated, and Shareef (distinguished) and yet he is vulgar, and Kareem (noble) and yet he is evil, and Saalih (righteous) and yet he is wicked, or Saeed (happy) and yet he is miserable, or Asad (Lion), Handhalah (sour) , or Alqamah (bitter) and yet he is not like that.<br /><br />So far removed is Allaah from all imperfections, and all glory and praise is due to Him and He is just as He has described Himself and high above that which His creation describe Him with.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">al-Haafidh al-Hakamee</span></strong><br /><em>A’laam as-Sunnah al-Manshoorah li I’tiqaad at-Taaifah an-Naajiyah al-Mansoorah</em><br /><br />Translated by Abul-Irbaad Abid Zargar<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=414">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=414</a><!-- m --></div>
