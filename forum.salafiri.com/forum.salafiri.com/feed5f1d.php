Poorness is neediness; meaning that one does not have that which suffices him. It is also permissible for her to pay her zakaah to her husband if he is poor; as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, when she said:<br /><br />“Is it permissible for me to give zakaah of my gold to him (my husband).”<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />“Yes.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://muqbel.net/fatwa.php?fatwa_id=1645">http://muqbel.net/fatwa.php?fatwa_id=1645</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2017 11:01 am</p><hr />
