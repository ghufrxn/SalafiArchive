So the condition of obligation does not necessitate for you that you have to go and acquire it; nor doe it necessitate that you have to come with the time in order for you to pray, nor does it necessitate that you go out and work so that you will be eligible to pay zakat and so due to it you pay. As for the condition of perfection, then perhaps its like is found in the like of the hadeeth in which the Prophet (Sallaallaahu ‘alaihi wa ‘alaa aalihi wa sallam) said: ((none of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself)) (Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) meaning: he does not believe with Eemaan which is perfect, since there is found within it a condition.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee</span></strong><br /><em>Ghaaratul Ashritah, volume 1, page 184</em><br /><br />Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=338">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=338</a><!-- m --></div>
