				<h3>Awakening Late For The Fajr Prayer At Sunrise Whilst Needing To Bath – Ibn Taimiyyah</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />Concerning a man who became junub and then awoke from sleep, however the morning has come in. Then he intends to bath but fears that the sun will rise so instead he makes wudhoo and prays. Then after the prayer he takes a bath, is he rewarded for the prayer or not?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0040FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />If he becomes junub (needing to bath from marital relations/seminal discharge) then upon him is to bath and pray in the correct time, it is not for him to delay the bathing. So if he only but awakens at the time of sunrise, then the majority of the Scholars say: that he should bath and pray after the rising of the sun – and not pray in a state of janaabah. Yet others from them say: that he should pray it within its time after making wudhoo and tayammum. However; the first (saying) is the most correct. And Allaah Knows best.<br /><br /><em>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah<br />Majmoo' al-fataawaa vol 21 page 469</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=758">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=758</a><!-- m --></div>
