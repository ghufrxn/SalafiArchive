<strong>ABOUT US</strong><br /><br />          The Salafi Research Institute [SRI] is a ‘non-profit’ course institute. SRI aims to organise a wide range of Islamic events, projects and activities including short and weekend based courses, seminars, workshops, social gatherings and more. SRI amongst other things focuses on the Salafi Creed and Manhaj with the interpretations of the Salaf as a source of rectification, purification and betterment of society. Through its deep rooted knowledge packed courses and events, delivered by experts, SRI delivers courses which are ideal for graduate and post graduate level learning going into depth based and targeted course structures. <br /><br />         We at SRI believe that the courses we provide are unique in that they use a modern and innovative approach, yet being academic based at its roots. This enables SRI to have the potential to be an important and exciting vehicle for promoting and improving understanding of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj and an institute of which can set the standard quality mark in course provision.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br /><br />          So what makes SRI different to the countless other Islamic course providers? It was this simple question that led to the formation of SRI. Course providers can be polarized between either being too general and those that are more focused, but on the affirmation aspects of  Islamic beliefs, yet at the same time glossing over and at times ignoring the rebuttal of the doubts and various proofs that are put forward by the people of Shirk and Bidah.<br /><br />          In simple terms, SRI is focused on bridging the gap in that it strongly believes that in comprehensively analyzing and replying to the ill founded doubts by the people of Shirk and Bidah, leaving no stone unturned, it can create a model that will allow its participants to present the true Creed, Manhaj and interpretations of the salaf to all, presenting Salafiyyah yet being balanced, academic and being equipped to make rebuttal of those that seek to harm the call to the Creed and Manhaj of the Salaf. <br /><br />          SRI aims through its academic and modern approach based learning to equip the participant with a ‘master key’ that will allow the individual to learn principles and rules of Salafiyyah empowering the individual with a progressive and academic core that will stand the salafi student well in any situation in the field of dawah and beyond. A powerful, knowledge equipped, analytically trained and robust student that can problem solve and reply to those who seek to tarnish the salafi dawah is much needed in the world today. May Allah allow all those at SRI to achieve that it sets out to do. Amin.<br /><br /><strong>FAQS.</strong><br /><br />The following are brief points about the Creed and Manhaj of the Salafi.<br /><br /><strong>What Creed and Manhaj do the Salafis adhere to?</strong><br /><br />The later part of this ummah cannot be rectified unless it reverts back to the beliefs and Manhaj as found in the Quran, Sunnah and understanding of the Salaf. Add to this, that knowledge of such matters one cannot simply learn by reading books but we must cling to the scholars past and present who are the inheritors of the Prophets and thus the most trustworthy and able, being the ones that we turn to in order to have rectification and purification. We call to the Creed of Tawhid and correct Aqidah first and then to the remaining pillars of Islam. If the Tawhid is pure and free from Shirk then the Manhaj will also be pure and upon the straight path.<br /><br /><strong>Who are the Salaf and Scholars?</strong><br /><br />The Salaf are the first three generations and all those who follow their way. The Companions, Tabi’een and Taba Tabi’een, following onto the likes of the Imams, Scholars of Hadith and revivers such as Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah [728H] to Shaikh ul-Islam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab [1206H]. The scholars today are many that are a source of excellence and guidance, from amongst them in recent times are the likes of Imam Badi ud din Sindhi [1416H], Imam Muhammad Nasir ud din Albani [1420H], and Imam Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz [1420H] Imam Muhammad bin Saleh al-Uthaymin [1421H], Shaikh Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wad’i [1422H] and most recently the flag bearer of Jarh wat Ta’dil and helper of Ahlus Sunnah, Shaikh Rabi ibn Hadi al-Madkhali, the Faqih of this Ummah Shaikh Saleh ibn Abdullah al-Fawzan, the Muhaddith Shaikh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad and the Grand Mufti Allamah Abdul Aziz Aal-Shaikh. We praise no Shaikh as infallible and free from error and mistake but at the same time honor, venerate and take our affairs back to the scholars as ordered by Allah “ask the people of knowledge if you know not”.<br /><br /><strong>What is the Salafi view regarding other parties and groups?</strong><br /><br />Labels are of no significance if the belief and Manhaj is incorrect. We hold it as part of our belief to clarify and repel the doubts of the Mushrikeen and Ahlul Bidah. This includes all those sects and individuals who have turned away from the way of the Quran, Sunnah and Salaf, regardless of whether they belong to any Jama’ah, Jamiyyah, Hizb, Sufi Tariqah or party. There are those such as, Anjam Chawdhry and his forefathers such as Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi and the modern day Jihadist Takfiris such as Abdullah al-Faisal, Anwar Awlaki, Abu Qatadah and others which have tarnished the Salafi name and we clarify their mistakes so that the people can be saved from the corrupted beliefs and ways. Our Mahaj is free from a methodology that accommodates and caters for the Ahlul Bidah, making excuses, Muwazanah and any form of Tamyi concerning them and their beliefs. In the words of Allamah Rabi Ibn Hadi al-Madkhali, “The Salafi Manhaj in relation to Ahlul Bidah is that of Umar to Sabigh Ibn Asal, Ali (RadhiAllahu Anhu) to the Khawarij and Abdullah Ibn Umar (RadhiAllahu Anhu) to those who denied the Qadr, they were all shunned and rebutted by Ahlus Sunnah and their Bidah and false methodologies were made clear and warned against.”<br /><br /><strong>Some modern neo-Sufis claim that the Salafis allow the disrespecting of the Prophets, Companions and Awliya?</strong><br /><br />This type of individual in the least has created an enmity with Allah himself who says, “The one who shows enmity towards a friend of mine verily let him be prepared for war with me”. This one must repent before he dies upon disbelief and innovation in belief and a corruption that will throw him into the depths of the hellfire, may Allah protect us. Amin<br /><br /><strong>What Madhab do the Salafis follow?</strong><br /><br />Whilst acknowledging the various Madhahib being present in today’s society, salvation and success lies in adhering to the Quran, Sunnah and the way of the Salaf, free from any bigotory, partisanship and blind following. “On that day the people shall be called (to account) with their Imams.” (Surah al-Isra:71) The Imam of the Salafis is Muhammad (salAllahu Alayhi Wasallam).<br />What are your views on unity?<br /><br />Unity is a mercy from Allah, whilst disunity is a punishment. We call for all the Muslims to unite and hold on tight to the rope of Allah, the Quran, Sunnah and way of the Salaf. The Messengers were sent to unite the people into one Ummah believing in Tawhid and freeing oneself from all that which is worshipped other than Allah. “And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided” (Surah Aal-Imran:103). However, we do not call to, rather warn from, a false unity such as the one that has been recently promoted by the people of innovation and desires “The Pledge of Mutual respect and cooperation between Sunni Muslim Scholars”. In times of dispute it is our belief that we “And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.” (Surah an-Nisa:59)<br /><br /><strong>Is there an “old Salafiyyah” and “new Salafiyyah”?</strong><br /><br />Many of those who introduce new methodologies and ways into Dawah Salafiyyah attempt to split the belief and Manhaj of the salaf in the past to the ways that some of them promote today, whether that be by political demonstrations, accommodating Ahlul Bidah, expanding the meaning of Ahlus Sunnah and so on. In the words of Shaikh Yahya an-Najmi [1429H] who said, “There is only one Salafiyyah. The one who claims there is an old and new salafiyyah has lied. If we contemplate on the Aqidah of the Salaf from the time of the companions to our times today, we find it to be one Aqidah, never contradicting each other.”<br />Are the Salafis terrorists or promote terrorism?<br /><br />Our Scholars have unanimously spoken against and actively warned against any form of extremism that is part of suicide bombings and terrorism. We hold it as part of our religion to distance ourselves and clarify the Salafi Manhaj free from the evils of the terrorist and those that preach hatred and sectarian violence. Refer to the tremendous book of Allamah Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, “With Which Religion and Intellect are Suicide Bombings and Destruction from Jihad.”<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">SRI</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 7:48 pm</p><hr />
