Allaah تعالى protect us and you from being among those who will not receive His Mercy on that Day.<br /><br />So who are these wretched ones?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">First:</span> Those who sell their covenants and oaths to Allaah for a small price.</strong><br /><br /><span style="color: #008000"><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّـهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُولَـٰئِكَ لَا خَلَاقَ لَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّـهُ وَلَا يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ<br /><br />{Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allaah’s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will Allaah speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.}</strong></span><br />[Surah aal-`Imraan (3): 77]<br /><br />In this verse there is clear evidence on the prohibition of taking false oaths in the name of Allaah for some worldly gains.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">Second:</span> al-Musbil (the one who lets down his lower garments below the ankles).<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Third:</span> al-Mannaan (the one who boasts of his favors done to others).<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Fourth:</span> The one who sells his goods by taking false oaths.</strong><br /><br />Abu Dharr رضي الله عنه said: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong><span style="color: #0000BF">“There are three (types of) people to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Resurrection nor look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful chastisement.” The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم repeated it three times. Abu Dharr said: They are ruined. Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah? Upon this, the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “(1) One who lets down his lower garments (below his ankles), (2) one who boasts of his favors done to another; and (3) who sells his goods by taking a false oath.”</span></strong> <br />[Saheeh Muslim (192, 193, 194)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">Fifth:</span> The one who has surplus water but prevents the travelers from accessing it.<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Sixth:</span> One who gives a Bai`a (pledge) to the ruler for worldly gains.</strong><br /><br />Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>“There are three persons whom Allaah will neither talk to nor look at, nor purify from (the sins), and they will have a painful punishment. (They are): (1) A man possessed superfluous water on a way and he withheld it from the travelers, (2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to a Muslim ruler and gives it only for worldly gains. If the ruler gives him what he wants, he remains obedient to It, otherwise he does not abide by it, and (3) a man bargains with another man after the `Asr prayer and the latter takes a false oath in the Name of Allaah) claiming that he has been offered so much for the thing and the former (believes him and) buys it.”</strong> </span><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (2672) and Saheeh Muslim (196)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">Seventh:</span> Aged adulterer.<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Eight: </span>The ruler who lies.<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Ninth:</span> A poor person full of pride.</strong><br /><br />It is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>“Three (are the persons) with whom Allaah would neither speak, nor would He absolve them on the Day of Resurrection and He would not look at them and there is grievous torment for them: (1) the aged adulterer, (2) the king who lies and (3) the proud destitute.”</strong></span> <br />[Saheeh Muslim (195)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">Tenth:</span> The one who disobeys the parents.<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Eleventh:</span> The woman who imitates men.<br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Twelfth:</span> Dayyooth (a man with no protective jealousy for his wife/daughter/sister).</strong><br /><br />It was narrated from Saalim bin `Abdullaah that his father (Ibn `Umar رضي الله عنهما) said: The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>“There are three at whom Allaah will not look on the Day of Resurrection: (1) The one who disobeys his parents, (2) the woman who imitates men in her outward appearance, and (3) the cuckold. And there are three who will not enter Paradise: (1) The one who disobeys his parents, (2) the drunkard, and (3) the one who reminds people of what he has given them.”</strong></span> <br />[Sunan al-Nasaa’ee (2562) and graded as “Hasan” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #BF0000">Thirteenth:</span> The one who has anal sex.</strong><br /><br />Ibn `Abbaas رضي الله عنهما narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>“Allaah will not look at a man who enters a man or a woman in the behind.”</strong></span> <br />[Sunan al-Tirmidhee (1165) and graded as “Hasan” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]<br /><br />Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color: #0000BF"><strong>“He who has intercourse with his wife through her anus is accursed.” </strong></span><br />[Sunan Abu Dawood (2162) and graded as “Hasan” by Shaikh al-Albaanee]</span></div>
