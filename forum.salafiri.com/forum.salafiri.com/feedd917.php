<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Reference:</span></strong> as-Sahwah al-Islaamiyyah – Question 5, Page 105<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> What is the ruling regarding narrating stories I have heard, but am unaware as to their authenticity, in the path of da’wah to some people, and likewise narrating stories which I know are fabricated [lies]?<br /><br />And what is the ruling regarding narrating a hadeeth whilst I do not know whether it is authentic or weak?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span> It is not permissible for a person, a storyteller or one who gives advice, to narrate a hadeeth and attribute it to the Messenger (sal-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) whilst he does not know if it is authentic. And it is [also] not permissible for him to narrate a hadeeth whilst he knows it to be weak. However, if he narrates a weak hadeeth to reveal it’s weakness and warn the people from it, then that is obligatory.<br /><br />Likewise, he should not narrate stories which he assumes are worthy [of being narrated] without checking [their authenticity], and he should not narrate stories which he knows are fabricated, because that is being dishonest and deceiving the people.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwa-online.com/narrating-unverified-stories-in-the-path-of-dawah/">http://www.fatwa-online.com/narrating-u ... -of-dawah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2016 12:37 am</p><hr />
