				<div class="content">A Reminder to those Who Opine on the Permissibility of Photos/Images and Pictures.<br /><br />Some people photos and images are allowed if they are not taken with the intention of remembrance or memory. This is nothing but playing with whims and desires. The Mushriks before never said they made images and pictures of their righteous people just to remember them or in memory. A simple point if pictures images are not taken for memory or remembrance, what are they taken for.<br /><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said with regards to the emergence of Shirk that it began with the demise of the righteous people and the people began to venerate their graves and taking care of them. Later they made pictures of them and eventually began to worship them. This was how Shirk first began and it's first form which emerged amongst the offspring of Adam Alayhis Salam and this is what happened amongst the people of Nuh Alayhis Salam (al-Hasanah Wal-Sayi'ah (pg.116)</div>
