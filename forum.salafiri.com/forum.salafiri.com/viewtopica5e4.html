				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Abu Muhammad Abdullah Ibnu Abee Zaid Alqayrawani [1] was asked concerning a person who felt it necessary to yawn during the prayer [Salaah]. Was [it permissible] for him to cover his mouth with his hand whilst yawing in Salaah?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> He answered: Yes, there is no problem with that.<br /><br /><em>Reference: Fataawa Ibnu Abee Zaid Al Qayrawaani. Fatwa no.71 page 121</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />[1] He is Abu Muhammad Abdullaah Ibnu Abee Zayd Abdur–Rahmaan Annafzee al-Qayruwaanee, nicknamed Maalik as-Sageer. [Little Maalik] for his in-depth knowledge of Imaam Malik Ibn Anas’s opinions on the subsidiary issues of the Sharee’ah [Fiqh]. He was born in the year 310 AH corresponding to 922 CE in the north of Tunisia; he studied with the major scholars of his time and the number of his teachers exceeded to over 50.<br /><br />He authored over 38 books. One of his famous books is Muqaddamatul-Qayruwaanee, which is an explanation of the Salafee Aqeedah. This has been explained in detail by Allaamah Abdul-Muhsin Alabaad, the Muhaddith of Madeenah in the Prophet’s Masjid, may Allaah’s praise and peace be with him. Ibnu Abee Zayd al-Qayruwaanee died in the year 386 A.H. on Monday evening in the month of Sha’baan at the age of 76. [TN]</div>
