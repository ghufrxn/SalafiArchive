				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">From Defender of the Sunnah to Apostate!</span></strong><br /><em>A warning from Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee:</span></strong> An example of this is Abdullah al-Qasemi. How many books does he have defending the Dawah of Shaykh of Islam Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, the Dawah of Tawheed?! His book, “The conflict between Islam and paganism”; look into it. (His book) “The lightning of Najd in sweeping away the darkness of Ad Dajwee”, read it. Read these books that he authored aiding the Dawah of Tawheed, the Salafi Dawah, and the Dawah of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab.<br /><br />Then after that he became an apostate! And the Scholars of the Dawah ruled that he was an apostate. And these rulings are sound and documented in the books. (He has) writings in defense of the Salafi Dawah, then he became an apostate!<br /><br />O slaves of Allah. What is your problem, why do you not fear for yourselves?! It is obligatory for all of us to fear for ourselves. Thus if the person is in a satisfactory condition then he should ask Allah for firmness; this is a principle.<br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"> رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا</span><br /><br /><em>Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us</em> (Soorah Aali Imraan 3:8)<br /><br />This is because the slave’s heart could deviate; even after he has been given guidance; because the hearts of the slaves’ are—as we have been informed by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم—between two Fingers from the Fingers of Ar-Rahman, He turns them however He wills. And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has informed us concerning the fitna that would occur during the last days, when a man will be a believer in the morning and a disbeliever by evening, or he will be a believer in the evening and a disbeliever by morning, selling his religion for worldly gain. We ask Allah for safety and security.<br /><br />So why are the people shaken when they hear that so and so used to aid the Sunnah and then he deviated? We ask Allah for firmness and we ask Allah to guide the likes of the person mentioned in the question. But let it be known that this is occurring and it has occurred, and this has happen and it will continue to happen; as long as man exists as long as man is alive. So don’t be alarmed, and don’t flee from this (reality) rather ask Allah for firmness and security.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br />Translator’s note: Abdullah al-Qasemi born in Buraydah, Saudi Arabia in 1907 and died in Cairo, Egypt in 1996. He became an atheist and was thoroughly refuted by Imaam As Sa’di.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/from-defender-of-the-sunnah-to-apostate">http://mtws.posthaven.com/from-defender ... o-apostate</a><!-- m --></div>
