Shaikh Rabee Bin Haadee Al Madkhalee (hafidha-hullaah) also stated:<br /><br />(Not) everyone who falls into bidah is declared an innovator; because if we were to adopt this principle, we would make Tabdee of the majority of the Imaams of Islaam.  Shaikhul Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>‘Indeed many of the Salaf and the Khalaf fell into innovation without being aware of (it); either (due to) acting on a weak hadeeth or understanding the text (in a manner) other than what Allaah and His Messenger intended, or (due to) Ijtihaad.’</strong></span><br /><br />At present we have Imaams of Ijtihaad; and his/their Ijtihaad (can) lead him/them to mistakes or innovation.  <span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>So, if we know (him) to be of a sound Manhaj and sound intent, being far removed from desires and being eager for the truth; if we know this about him and he falls into innovation, he is not declared an innovator.</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>But if we know him to be upon desires and evil intent, and we know of affairs about him showing that he desires innovation, he is declared an innovator.  You find them (Salaf) passing the judgement of Tabdee on many people due to this.</strong></span><br /><br />And many people fell into bidah but were not called innovators; because they (Salaf) were acquainted with their sound and good intents, their eagerness for the truth and the soundness of the Manhaj they traversed.<br /><br />[<em>Quoted by Shaikh Ahmad Baazmool in ‘Siyaanatus Salafi Min Waswasati Wa Talbeesaat Ali Al-Halabi': page: 165</em>]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/what-is-the-difference-between-imams-an-nawawi-and-ibn-hajr-and-the-innovators/">https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/what- ... nnovators/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2016 10:21 pm</p><hr />
