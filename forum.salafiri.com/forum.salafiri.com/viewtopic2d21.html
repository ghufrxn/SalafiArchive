He worked on the following book, added the References to the Quran and added other benefits, where is the reprimand for the following action.<br /><br />Let the likes Mohammad Yasir, Usamah Muttakin and their other sympathisers ponder over the following and tell us what their elders believed. This also applies to Abdur rahman ibn Yusuf and others like him who are ardent defenders of Maulana Thanwi.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">
