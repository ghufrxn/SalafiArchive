Show me twelve men who bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; and then Allaah will remove the Anger that He has upon them from every Jew beneath the sky.”<br /><br />He said: So they were silent; none of them answered him. Then he repeated it to them, but none of them answered him. So he said:<br /><br />“You have refused. So by Allaah, I am certainly ‘al-Haashir’ (the first one to be resurrected), and I am ‘al-`Aaqib’ (the Final Prophet.), and I am the Chosen Prophet (an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa), whether you believe or reject faith.”<br /><br />Then he departed, and I was with him, until we had almost gone out when a man said from behind us: “Remain where you are, O Muhammad!” So that man said:<br /><br />“O company of Jews, what sort of a person do you know me to be amongst you?”<br /><br />They said:<br /><br />“By Allaah, we do not know there to have been any man amongst us who knew the Book of Allaah better than you do, nor anyone having more religious knowledge than you, nor than your father before you, and nor than your grandfather before your father.”<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />“Then I testify in his favour that, by Allaah, he is the Prophet of Allaah whom you find mentioned in the Tawraat.”<br /><br />So they said:<br /><br />“You have lied”<br /><br />And they rebutted his saying and spoke evil of him. So Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ said:<br /><br />“You people have lied; your speech will never be accepted: you have just been praising him, as you have done, with good; but when he believed, then you declared him to be a liar, and said about him what you said. So your speech will never be accepted.”<br /><br />He said: So the three of us went out: Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ, myself, and ‘Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah – the Most High – sent down concerning him:<br /><br />[[Do you see that if this Qur’aan is sent down by Allaah and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from Banoo Israa-eel (i.e. `Abdullaah ibn Salaam) bore witness to its like, and he believed, whereas you haughtily rejected. Indeed Allaah does not guide the unbelieving wrongdoers.]]<br /><br /><strong>[Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46):10]</strong><br /><br />Shaikh al-Albaanee said in ‘Saheehus-Seerah’ p.81: “Reported by Ahmad (6/25) and the additions are his, and by al-Haakim (3/415-416) and he said: “’Saheeh’ to the standard of the two Shaikh’! And adh-Dhahabee agreed!<br /><br />However it is to the standard of Muslim alone, since al-Bukhaaree does not include any narrations of Safwaan ibn ‘Amr except in ‘al-Adabul-Mufrad’.”<br /><br /><em>[Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com">www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a><!-- w --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Nov 28, 2016 10:46 pm</p><hr />
