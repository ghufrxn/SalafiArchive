				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Interracial Marriage in Islam</span></span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh Abdul Aziz ibn Baz—may Allah have mercy upon him<br /><br />Allah the Exalted said:<br /><br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَى وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ<br /><br />O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you nations and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. (Soorah Al Hujurat 49:13)<br /><br />And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم married Fatimah bint Qays from the tribe of Quraysh to Usamah ibn Zayd and he was a freed slave; the Prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام freed him.<br /><br />And Abdur Rahman ibn Awf from the tribe of Quraysh married his sister to Bilaal ibn Rabah the Ethiopian; while she was from the noble Quraysh. Thus this affair is broad, and all praises belong to Allah.<br /><br />And Zayd ibn Haarith married Zaynab bint Jahsh the paternal cousin of the Prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام. Therefore the matter is broad and all praises belong to Allah. The important thing is the religion.<br /><br />If the woman desires to marry him and he is religious, and he is known for his religion, then all praises belong to Allah.<br /><br />Translator’s note: Usamah ibn Zayd: His mother was Umm Ayman Barakah from Ethiopia. She was from the caretakers of the Prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام during his infancy. She died during the rule of Uthman bin Affan. His father was Zayd ibn Haarith the freed slave of the Prophet عليه الصلاة والسلامThe Tribe of Quraysah are the best of the Arabs. <br />(مجموع فتاوى ابن عثيمين (7/183)<br /><br />Abdur Rahman ibn Awf is from the ten companions promised paradise in the narration collected by At Tirmidi.<br /><br />Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/interracial-marriage-in-islam" class="postlink">http://mtws.posthaven.com/interracial-marriage-in-islam</a></div>
