Taking and accepting the statement of a scholar or a holy man which he presents from the Quran and Hadith is not Taqlid, rather this is ittiba. This is because Taqlid is to accept the OPINION of someone and Ittiba is to accept the NARRATION of someone. From what is obligatory upon us, is to accept the authentic ahadith and then to act upon them. It is not however obligatory upon us to take the opinion of someone and then to follow it.</span></strong><br /><br />Taken from Daâ€™yatul Iman Ila Tawheed ur-Rahman (p.117) of Imam Nawab Siddique Hasan Khan<br /><br /><img src="../markazsunnahleicester.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG-20141120-WA0015.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="../markazsunnahleicester.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG-20141120-WA0014.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></div>
