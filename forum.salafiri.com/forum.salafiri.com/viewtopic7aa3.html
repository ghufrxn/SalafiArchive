Well the answer is, these people are implementing a forgotten Sunnah.<br /><br />‘Umar ibn ‘Ata bin Abi Al-Khuwar narrated that Nafi bin Jubair sent him to As-Sa’ib bin Yazid,the maternal nephew of Namir, asking him regarding something Mu’awiyah had seen him do in the prayer. He said: “I prayed Jum’uah with Mu’awiyah in his enclosure and when he finished, I stood up in my place and prayed. When he went inside he sent for me and said” Do not repeat what you have just done. If you pray Jum’uah don’t join it with another prayer until you speak or exit the masjid. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered us to separate between prayers. One prayer mustn’t be joined with another until you speak or exit.<br /><br /><em>Collected by Muslim (883)</em><br /><br />Imaam an-Nawawee explains this saying: “In this hadeeth there is evidence for what the scholars say [i.e.] that it is preferred to pray the optional prayers in another place than where one prayed their obligatory prayer. And the best place for that is the house, but any other place inside the masjid is still valid. “<br /><br /><em>[Taken from Saheeh Muslim The book of Jumu’ah p. 409-410]</em><br /><br />Shaikhul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: “‘The Sunnah is to separate between performing the obligatory and optional Salat in Jumu’ah Salat and other Salawaat as was narrated in the “Sahih” that he (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited that any [obligatory] Salat be followed immediately by [optional] one; one should separate between them with speech or changing one’s place’”<br /><br /><strong>Taken from: The Clarified Ruling of Mistakes Done in Salat – Mashhoor Hasan Aal Salmaan</strong><br /><br />Source: <a href="http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/08/14/changing-positions-after-praying-a-fardh-prayer-in-order-to-pray-a-sunnah-prayer/" class="postlink">http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/08/14/changing-positions-after-praying-a-fardh-prayer-in-order-to-pray-a-sunnah-prayer/</a></div>
