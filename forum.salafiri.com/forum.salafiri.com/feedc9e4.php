An important Qaidah ie principle revolving around maslaha wa mafsadah.<br /><br />Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />&quot;if by trying to achieve righteousness and completing good deeds and likewise and similarly commanding good and forbidding evil brings about more harm instead of good, then under such circumstances commanding the good and forbidding the evil is impermissible and this position is well known from Imam Ahmad.&quot; (Al-Istiqamah 1/330)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This principle coupled with the understanding of the Salaf, their statements and understanding of fiqh ul-waqiah, what benefit did the so call Arab springs bring. Is anyone in a better situation?<br /><br />Mankind is responsible for his own action. By not teaching the people the Sunnah of Rasulullah sallalahu alayhi wasallam or being firm on the methodology of Ahlus Sunnah or on the contrary downplaying it's importance and pivotal role in modern society, man is responsible individually and or collectively as such principles fall under collective obligation.<br /><br />The point being not to be hasty and weighing the affairs with the major scholars of Ahlus Sunnah.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> â€” Thu Mar 23, 2017 6:21 pm</p><hr />
