<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">The Ruling on Madhi (Prostrate Fluid)</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>What is Madhi?</strong><br /><br />Imam Nawawi said: &quot;(Madhi) is a sticky white fluid that is emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Its emission is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it does not gush out in spurts, and it is not followed by exhaustion. This may happen to men and women alike, although it is more common among women.&quot;<br /><br />Explanation of Sahih Muslim, 3/213<br /><br /><strong>Madhi is najis (impure):</strong><br /><br />The evidence for this is the report of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdaad to ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it. So he asked him, and he said: ‘It requires wudoo’.’” (Recorded by Bukhari and Muslim, this version was narrated by al-Bukhari)<br /><br />Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: &quot;The ummah is unanimously agreed that madhiy (prostatic fluid) and wadiy (a thick white fluid which is passed after passing urine) are impure (naajis).&quot;<br /><br />al-Majmoo‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, 1/571<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Sep 03, 2016 2:18 am</p><hr />
