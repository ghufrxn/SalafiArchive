			<div class="content"><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said:</span><br /><br />In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.<br /><br />All praise is due to Allah, and may the blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.<br /><br />In these two blessed Friday sermons, we have heard a lot of good by our preacher (Khateeb) – may Allah grant him success. He spoke on one of the most serious issues, namely the issue of women.<br /><br />O brothers!<br /><br />Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) created the woman, just as the man, for a great duty in this life. <span style="color: #0000FF">Each have their (own) tasks.</span> The men have their tasks and the women have their tasks. If each stick to their own tasks and fulfill them, the society would attain a great deal of good. <span style="color: #0000FF">If this order were to be shaken, a great deficiency would occur</span>, just as you heard about the role of the woman in the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, as well as her role in the disbelieving countries of today and her role with the religious Muslims.<br /><br />The woman is very important and that is why the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that she is well taken care of.<br /><br />He said in his Kutbah (sermon) on ‘Arafah in connection to his farewell pilgrimage:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>“Treat your women well, for they are captives with you.”</em></span><br /><br />(Ibn Majah [1851])<br /><br />The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to take good care of the women because they play an important role in the society. It is not only about taking good care of them and giving them their due rights… this is obligatory; <span style="color: #0000FF">what is more important is to protect them from indecencies</span> – the woman is weak as you know – and [to protect them from] trying appearances [i.e. fitnah] and letting them do whatever they want to do. This is the most important thing [that] the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered [in regards to women], <span style="color: #0000FF">namely that we protect them</span>.<br /><br />Allah (jalla wa ‘ala) said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">“Men are in charge of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property, etc.).”</span><br /><br />[Qur’an 4:34]<br /><br />What does it mean that the man is in charge of the woman? Is it only about providing (for her) and justice?<br /><br />It is not only about that. His responsibility is (also) about something that is more important. <span style="color: #0000FF">He should namely protect this woman so that she does not lose it, frees herself and [begins to] take shyness and chastity lightly.</span> This is the greatest responsibility of the man in regards to the woman.<br /><br />The “man” in the ayah is not only referring to the husband. <span style="color: #0000FF">The man, whether it be her father, brother or some other guardian, is responsible for her and protects her</span>. If it were to go to the length of him having to punish her, he then does it [1]:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">“But those [wives] form whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.”</span><br /><br />[Qur’an 4:34, interpretation of the meanings]<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">The woman is thus in need of being under observation.</span><br /><br />The enemies of Islam [in] these days concentrate on the issue of women. <span style="color: #0000FF">They know that she is the most serious matter in the society.</span> They focus on her. They wage war against the chastity and honour, and consider it to be oppression against women. If the woman sticks to chastity and honour, they say that she is deprived of liberty. The fact of the matter is that it is just at that time her freedom (liberty) is preserved (i.e. when she sticks to chastity and honour). She can freely obey Allah, raise her children and fulfill that which Allah has given her as a responsibility. She is as a shepherdess in the home of her husband and (is) responsible for her flock.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">This is her true freedom.</span><br /><br />As for her freedom in nudity, indecencies in front of other people, flirtatious gait in the stores/shops and the ability to go wherever she wants to, <span style="color: #FF0000">then this is a type of slavery and not a freedom</span>. It is slavery to temptation and satan.<br /><br />O servants of Allah!<br /><br />Freedom lies in obeying and worshipping Allah. <span style="color: #0000FF">Therein lies the glory of the soul and the honour of the human, and their happiness in this life and the next one.</span> The one who acts disobediently towards Allah and his commands, whether it is about women or anything else, is one of the degraded slaves of the devils among the humans and the Jinns.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">It is slavery and not freedom.</span><br /><br />We have to know this! We have to preserve our women among the wives, daughters and relatives. We have to cooperate in protecting them and to refrain from listening to this propaganda [by the Kuffar in the West]. The Kuffar (disbelievers) are trying to eradicate Islam by all possible means. <span style="color: #0000FF">The greatest ways of destruction is to destroy the woman.</span> Because the woman is the basis of the family and the home. If she is destroyed, the home and the family is destroyed as well. The daughters will be destroyed after having copied their destroyed mothers and relatives.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Thus, we have to safeguard our women.</span><br /><br />Even If the Kuffar have been successful in degrading some Islamic countries, they will never – by the will and motion of Allah – succeed in doing the same thing with this county, which is the country of the two holy mosques in which the revelation was sent down to, and in which the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent. Herein are men who take care of her honour, even if some deluded men and women take this issue lightly. This country has men who safeguard their honour and the honour of their female relatives. You belong to them – in sha’ Allah – and (those) who will initiate it.<br /><br />We have to fear Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) and live up to this great responsibility. If we do it, we will protect our homes, children, families and societies. She is thusly the basis. <span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>Thus, the enemy focuses on her</strong></span>. They are focused on the woman. They have her in a specific focus you are familiar with: in books, papers, magazines, newspapers, media, internet, and all other (possible) fields. They want this country to end up as the other countries so that the manners disappear and the honour gets lost. It will then become easy for the Kuffar (disbelievers) to eradicate Islam from its basis.<br /><br />The poet said:<br /><br />‘The nations exist as long as their manners exist, when their manners vanish, so do they.’<br /><br />If the manners disappear, then there is nothing left. <span style="color: #0000FF">The purpose of the manners is the honour, behaviour, shyness and dignity.</span> This is what the manners are (ahlaaq).<br /><br />Another poet said:<br /><br /><em>‘I do not say that one should allow the women to show their faces as the men and to walk around in the shops; they have a lot of duties in their homes, as the man who is the possessor of the sword and the spear.’</em> [2]<br /><br />The woman has her line of work and the man has his. If each of them does their suitable works, the society will then be good and the welfare will be complete. <span style="color: #0000FF">But if this order were to be shaken, the society would then become deficient.</span> That is why the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) cursed the masculine women and the feminine men. All of this just to preserve the woman and allow her to stay in her natural nature, religion, character and honour. The glory and honour should be protected and preserved.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Read the chapter “an-Nur” (of the Qur’an).</span> You will find therein how greatly and notably the women are protected with covering and permission before one enters into the homes. <span style="color: #0000FF">The same goes for the Sunnah.</span><br /><br />The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade the woman from traveling alone without a Mahram and said:<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last day to travel without a Mahram.”</span></em><br /><br />(al-Bukhari [3006] and Muslim [1341])<br /><br />He forbade that she is alone in private with a man who is not her Mahram and said:<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“A man is not alone with a woman but that the Shaytaan makes a third.”</span></em><br /><br />(at-Tirmidhee [1171])<br /><br />He forbade the women from mixing with the men. That is why the women prayed with the Muslims behind the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and behind the men in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They were so covered that no one could recognize them. They prayed behind the men. <span style="color: #0000FF">Herein is a proof that mixing is prohibited between both of the sexes.</span> If a woman is not allowed to mix with men in the mosque, which is a place of worship and piousness, one can then ask how she would be allowed to mix with them in offices, amusement parks, parties, and markets.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">This matter is very serious.</span><br /><br />We are surrounded by the enemy now and an ideological warfare. You are well aware of the ideological warfare that is taking place now. <span style="color: #0000FF">The Kuffar (disbelievers) are waging war against the Muslim countries with weapons, ideologies and all other means.</span> We are, as I said before, surrounded by the enemy. We have to be observant.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">If we are with Allah, Allah is with us.</span><br /><br />He said:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>“He (Allah) said: “Fear not, verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing.”</em></span><br /><br />[Qur’an 20:46] <br /><br />If we are with Allah, Allah is then with us.<br /><br />And if Allah is with us, nobody can hurt us:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>“Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allah is with us.”</em></span><br /><br />[Qur’an 9:40, interpretation of the meanings]<br /><br />But who is Allah with?<br /><br />Allah is especially with the pious, those who do right and the believers. We thusly have to be with Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala).<br /><br />The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Ibn ‘Abbas [what means]:<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>“Boy! Take care of Allah and He will take care of you. Take care of Allah and you will find Him in front of you.”</em></span><br /><br />(at-Tirmidhee [2516])<br /><br />We have to, as I said before, be with Allah, obey Him and follow His commands and avoid His prohibitions, for Him (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to be with us with His victory, His support and His help.<br /><br />I ask Allah for forgiveness and I repent before Him. And I ask Allah to preserve us and you with His preservation and that He looks after us and you with His victory and help. And may the blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.<br /><br />Transcribed from the Lecture ‘Risaalah ilaal-Mar’ah’ – A Message to the Woman by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan.
