Then it would be something prohibited without doubt.<br /><br />The third: that it (the ruqyah) be something intelligible and known. For if it  is from the types of tilasm (talismanic mysterious words) and trickery then it is not permissible.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>(al qawl ul mufeed (1/187) of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al ‘Uthaymeen rahimahullaah, quoted in Mu’jam at Ta’reefaat p205 – translated by Nasser ibn Najam)</strong></span><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/seeking-ruqyah-from-other-people/">https://sughayyirah.wordpress.com/2012/ ... er-people/</a><!-- m --></div>
