Umar saw him and said to him sit down, since indeed the people of the book were destroyed because they did not leave a gap after their prayer.<br /><br />The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to him:<br /><br /><ul>أحسن ابن الخطاب<br /><br />‘You have done well O Ibn Khattab!’</ul><br /><em>[Collected by Ahmad,  its Isnad is Saheeh.]</em><br /><br /><br />Shaykh Albaani said: ‘This hadeeth is a clear text in that it is prohibited to hasten to pray the Sunnah prayer after the obligatory prayer without speaking or leaving the Masjid, like many of the non-Arabs do,  and especially the Turks. Indeed we see them in the Haramain Sharafain (the holy Masjid in Makkah and the Prophet’s Masjid in Madina), the Imaam is about to give the Salam from the prayer, except that these people hasten, from over here and over there standing to pray the Sunnah!<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[From: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ No. 2549 6/105]</span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/bite-size-20-not-praying-the-sunnah-prayer-directly-after-the-obligatory-prayer/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ry-prayer/</a><!-- m --></div>
