<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Affirmation of Words or Speech for Allaah (Kalaam Allaah)</span></strong><br /><br />The Jahmees believe that the the Word and Speech of Allaah is created. Their arguments are summarized as followed:<br /><br />-There appear contradictions in the Quraan, twenty-two of them have been displayed in the beginning of this book, this shows it is created, as the creation of Allaah is imperfect and perfection is only for Allaah.<br /><br />-If we say Allaah Speaks, then this necessitates a series of imperfections for Him. It implies he has lips, a tongue, a voice, a sound, a head, a body etc. and we cannot affirm this for Allaah.<br /><br />-It doesn't collerate with intellect that Allaah would Speak.<br /><br />-They negate the fact that Allaah and His Attributes are part of one entity (Dhaat)<br /><br />-and that the Ayaat that talk about His Speech or Word can be interpreted (Ta'weel). For example, sending down the Quraan is like the sending of rain, or iron, all of which are created.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Belief of others from the People of Innovation</span></strong><br /><br />-The Mu’tazilah believe that Allaah Speaks however this speech is a separate entity to Allaah. In essence, they affirm the Attribute of Speech to Allaah but it is a separate, created entity.<br /><br />-The Asharees and the Mataroodees believe that Allaah Speaks but He Speaks within Himself. The term coined for this is Kalaam Nafsee.<br /><br />-The philosophers (from them are the early Soofees) who said that speech is something that must be understood and the reasons for the speech must be also known. With these two points, we cannot affirm speech for Allaah as we cant understand His Speech and we don’t know why He Spoke thus the Quran is not from the speech of Allah.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">These parties base their argument on several factors. They argue:</span></strong><br /><br />-Allaah, the Most High, has existed since eternity so if we say He speaks now it means that He was unable to speak before. It also implies he didn’t know that He would speak before.<br /><br />-Similar to the Jahmees, they claim that by affirming speech to Allaah is necessitates that He must have a series of imperfection, i.e. He needs language to communicate, He needs a voice etc.<br /><br />-The intellect cannot affirm a god that speaks, thus the meaning of Speech or Word of Allaah must have an alternative meaning.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ahl as-Sunnah Affirm Speech for Allaah and that the Quraan is the Uncreated Word of Allaah</span></strong><br /><br /><em>From the evidences:</em><br /><br />Allaah, the Most High, says:   “and whose words can be truer than those of Allah?” [an-Nisaa 4:122]   And,  “hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an)” [at-Tawbah 9:6]   And,  “and his Lord spoke to him” [al-A’raaf 7:143]   And,  “and to Musa (Moses) Allah spoke directly.” [an-Nisaa 4:164] And, “but the Word from Me took effect (about evil-doers)” [as-Sajdah 32:13]<br /><br />And there are many other evidences from the Quraan and the Sunnah which prove that Allaah Speaks and the Quraan is His Word.<br /><br />Secondly, the Revelation of Allaah is from His Knowledge and this cannot be created:<br /><br />  “Know then that the Revelation (this Qur'an) is sent down with the Knowledge of Allah and that La ilaha illa Huwa” [Hood 11:14]<br /><br />And,<br /><br />“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration that is inspired.” [an-Najm 53:3-4]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Further Points Found within the Sharee'ah to Affirm the Attribute of Speech - according to His Majesty and Might - and The Quraan Being the Words of Allaah:</span></strong><br /><br />1) The Quraan is unique and unable to be replicated by the creation, thus this shows that the Qur’aan is from the Knowledge and Speech of Allaah.<br /><br />2) They claimed that the Speech of Allaah is a metaphor (Majaaz), however linguistically, the Usl or origin of language is understood by its face value (Haqeeqee) as speech is not used a metaphorical way of communication.<br /><br />3) Allah has sent it down from Himself (Nazalah) thus illustrating that it is not created as it has Come From Him and not a separate part of creation.<br /><br />4) The Quran is from Allaah’s Knowledge, therefore something from the Sifat of Allaah can not be created.<br /><br />5) Speech (cf. 9:6) or calling out (cf. 28:30) are from the Sifat of Allaah and such actions cannot be a metaphor.<br /><br />6) The Speech or Words of Allaah were heard by Jibreel [Peace be upon him] and conveyed to the Messenger as is proven in authentic texts. This shows a chain of narration which was done by speech. The same can also be said about other Prophets like Musa (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon them all). All this proves that a message was conveyed by speech and words.<br /><br />7) What is read, heard, recited are all from Speech and Words of Allaah, as the Mother of the Believers A’aishah [may Allaah be Pleased with her and her father] said, “Everything between the two covers is from Kalam of Allah.” [Irwaa al-Ghaleel 2559, who said he has not found an Isnaad for this narration]<br /><br />8) The famous scholar of Usool, Ibn Maalik [may Allaah have Mercy on him], said, “Kalam or speech is everything we comprehend and bring benefit; conveyed in word and meaning.”<br /><br />However, in the Arabic language, communicating without using words or speech is not called talking or speaking. In Surah Maryam (19:29), Maryam pointed to Esaa [Peace be upon them both] without speaking and the word used is Ishaarah or pointed. This proves that she communicated without speech, thus speech entails communication with the use of words and letters.<br /><br />This proves that words have a meaning, and all of this is found in the Quraan. Therefore, the Quraan is from the Speech of Allaah.<br /><br />9) Allaah says, “Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment” (7:53) so as the creation is from Allah so is the commandment or the Quran. He would not Create without Sending Down a Command, i.e. His Words and Speech.<br /><br />10) The Salaf agreed that the Quraan is “From Him and to Him it will return (towards the end of time)”. Meaning, the Quraan came from Him before the creation and to Him it will return before the creation perishes. Some have stated that it means that the speech is attributed only to the one who says it, therefore it is not possible to say that it is the Words of Allaah but spoken by Jibreel, or that the Quraan is a representation of the Words of Allaah but not actually the words of Allaah (as the Kulaabiyyah, Asharees and Mataroodee believe).<br /><br />11) In Salah we recite the Quraan and we are not allowed utter anything but the Quraan except with evidence. Talking and even Dhikr which is not connected to the Salaat can nullify the Salaat. Therefore, everyday speech used nullifies the prayer. Had the Quraan been created, then there would be no difference between it and normal everyday speech.<br /><br />12) The effects that the Speech of Allaah has on people demonstrates how it can only be from Allah and His Speech.<br /><br />13) The Speech of Allah is from the highest standard of Arabic grammar and there are no contradictions within it, thus showing it is perfect in its form and in meaning.<br /><br />14) The person who wants to recite it needs purification to touch it, thus the Quran is not from the creation of Allaah as nothing touched needs purification except the Words of Allaah.<br /><br />15) Ahl as-Sunnah believe that Allaah Speaks as He wills and When He Wills. For example, He Spoke before the creation when He Decreed the Pre-Decree. He Spoke when the Quraan was revealed to the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] and He Will Speak on the Day of Judgement. Thus, Allaah Speaks and this is from His Divine Attributes; He Does and Acts as and when He Pleases.<br /><br />16) Allaah revealed Ayaat in connection to some events that occurred, such as battles, confirmation of Ijtihaad, the issue of Dhihaar (cf. 58:1) etc. This shows that the Speech of Allah is connected to Hearing (as-Samee’).<br /><br /><em>Source:</em> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/affirmation-of-words-or-speech-for.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11 ... h-for.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 2:21 pm</p><hr />
