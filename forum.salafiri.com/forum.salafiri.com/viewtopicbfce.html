Ibn Baaz Replies<br /><br />“One time in his car I asked him, ‘Yaa Shaikh ’Abdul-’Aziz, I don’t know anyone except that they love you, young or old, male or female, this is almost something unanimous, what is the secret to that, O Shaikh?’ So he, may Allaah have mercy on him, tried to excuse himself from answering. So I repeated the question once or twice more, so he said words to the effect, ‘I do not have spite/hatred for any Muslim, and I do not hear of enmity between two except that I rush to reconcile between them.’”<br /><br />Al-Imaam Ibn Baaz, Duroos wa Mawaaqif wa ’Ibar, pp. 66-67.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13/young-or-old-male-or-female-they-all-loved-ibn-baaz-but-why-what-was-the-secret-ibn-baaz-replies/">https://giftsofknowledge.net/2014/02/13 ... z-replies/</a><!-- m --></div>
