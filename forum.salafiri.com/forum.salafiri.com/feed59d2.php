<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Advice During The Time In Which Trials Have Increased, People of Innovation Have Spread and the Scholars Are Passing Away</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">By: Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</span></strong><br /><br />Question: O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars (are increasing)?<br /><br />Answer: I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have taqwa of Allaah and increase in your supplication to Allaah that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).<br /><br />Then I advise you with seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah’s permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and do not become lazy upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.<br /><br />Translated by Abu Anas Atif Hasan<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://albinaapublishing.com/advice-during-the-time-in-which-trials-have-increased-people-of-innovation-have-spread-and-the-scholars-are-passing-away/">http://albinaapublishing.com/advice-dur ... sing-away/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Sep 16, 2016 11:38 pm</p><hr />
