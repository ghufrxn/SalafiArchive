And they rebut the opposer, whether he was from Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah or other than them.<br /><br />However, if the rebuked person is from Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah and from those who defend the Sunnah, if his errors were not causing deficiency in aqeedah or the manhaj of the prophet, then the good (deeds) of this person is mentioned because they override his errors and slips that are not in aqeedah nor in manhaj, and because he is supporting the Sunnah.<br /><br />As (for) if the rebuked person is from people of misguidance and innovation, and he is laying foundations for it, it is impermissible to mention his good (deeds), and violating this caused a great corruption…[until he said] And it is not an obligation to mention the good (deeds) of the rebutted.<br /><br />Allah praised the believers without mentioning their bad and he rebuked the disbelievers, the hypocrites and the transgressors without mentioning their good.”<br /><br />Ref: Da’aa’imu Minhaajin-Nubuwwah, pages 312-313<br /><br />Posted by Abdul Kareem Ibn Ozzie<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Apr 01, 2017 12:28 am</p><hr />
