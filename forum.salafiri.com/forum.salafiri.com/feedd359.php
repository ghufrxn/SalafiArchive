<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">‘Who Created Allaah?’</span></strong><br /><em>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani [1420H]</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shaykh al-Albani refutes this doubt by researching the following Ahadeeth:<br /><br />On the authority of ‘Aa’ishah –Radi Allaahu anha– who said that the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said: ‘If the Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created you?’ say ‘Allaah.’ Then he will say: who created Allaah? So if one of you finds this situation then say: ‘I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers.’ This doubt will then leave you.’<br /><br />Narrated by Ahmad graded Hasan by Albani [saheehah 116]<br /><br />In another narration also in Saheehah (Hadeeth No.117), the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘The Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created this? Who created that? Who created this? Until he says who created your lord? So if this reaches you then seek refuge in Allaah and it will end.’<br /><br />Narrated by Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Sunni.<br /><br />In the wording narrated by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said:<br /><br />‘The people will question one another so much that one of them will say: So Allaah created the creation, then who created Allaah Azza wa Jal? So if they say this, then say:<br /><br /><ul>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَد ٌ ,اللَّهُ الصَّمَد ُ, لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَد ْ, وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًاأَحَدٌ الإخلاص: ١ – ٤</ul><br /><ul><em>&lt;&lt; Say: He is Allaah, The One. Allaahus-Samad, He does not beget nor was he begotten, and there is none like unto Him. &gt;&gt;</em></ul><br />Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan.<br /><br />Narrated by Abu Dawood &amp; Ibn Sunni and graded Hasan by Albani.<br /><br />Then Shaykh Albani comments by saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Fiqh al-Hadeeth:</span></strong><br /><br />These authentic Ahadeeth indicate that it is obligatory for the one Shaytan whispers to, by saying ‘who created Allaah?’, that he turns away from debating with him and responds with what was mentioned in the previous Ahadeeth, the summary of which is:<br /><br />I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers. ‘He is Allaah, The One, Allaahus-Samad, He does not beget nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Him.’ Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan. This (then) stops him from being carried away by the whisperings of Shaytan.<br /><br />I truly believe that whoever does this sincerely, out of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, these whisperings will definitely leave him and his Shaytan will be defeated due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–: ‘Then this doubt will leave you.’<br /><br />This noble prophetic teaching is more beneficial and more definitive against whisperings than intellectual debate in this issue, since it is very rare that such a debate will be beneficial. What is sad is that the majority of people are neglectful of this noble prophetic teaching! So take heed O Muslims, learn the Sunnah of your Prophet and implement it, in it is cure and honour for you.’<br /><br /><em>[Silsilah Saheehah: 118]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/who-created-allaah/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ed-allaah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2017 11:21 pm</p><hr />
