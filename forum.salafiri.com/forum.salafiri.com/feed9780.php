Transnational Salafism - The Connection of the Scholars of Mali and the Ahl al-Hadith of the Subcontinent<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah b. Mahmud al-Madani (d.1370/1951)<br /><br />Mali has seen the ruthless slaying of Muslims, and we pray to Allah for their forgiveness, Amin. Our brothers, sisters and children in Mali deserve an equal amount of love, veneration, respect and care as any other Muslim.<br /><br />I wanted to paint Mali in a better light. We know the ludicrous and garbage filled Islamophobic media does a pretty decent job of being biased and showing it's money worth to it's neocon masters, of course no surprises there.<br /><br />We want to share the rich and vibrant history of the transnational Salafi community while focussing on Mali and also the intrinsic link of Ahl al-Sunnah. This, we hope, will also add further clarification and diversify the oft-repeated yet incorrect presentation of the so called modern development of the Salafi Movement, as projected by the modern Islamologists, who claim Salafism grew out of Egypt at the turn of or early 20th century.<br /><br />Out of Mali came the formidable and amazing Salafi scholar, Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah b. Mahmud al-Madani. He was born in 1319/1906, he was born around Timbuktu and was Tuareg in origin. The Shaykh migrated to Madinah with this father when he was just 5 years old around 1324H. His father, who was also a scholar, Shaykh Mahmud al-Timbukti died before King Abd al-Aziz took control of the Hijaz. <br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah b. Mahmud al-Madani studied with the scholars of Madinah during his time at Madrassah al-Ulum al-Shar'iyyah. He went on to teach at the same Madrassah after finishing his studies. Then in 1353/1934 he was appointed as an Imam of Masjid al-Nabawi in Madinah. He remained as the Imam for a while and thereafter resigned from this post in order to travel to India to deepen and to excel in Ilm al-Hadith (the science or knowledge of Hadith)<br /><br />In India, Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah went straight to Banaras (Varansi) and other areas in that region. Banaras and the surrounding areas were already rich in the science and knowledge of Hadith due to the efforts of Shaikh Abd al-Haqq Muhajar Makki, the student of Imam al-Shawkani.<br /><br />In India, Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah studied with Shaykh Abd al-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, the author of Tuhfatul Ahwadhi, he also studied under Shaykh Shams al-Haqq al-Azimabadi, the author of A'un al-Mabud as well as.otber scholars.<br /><br />The Shaykh then returned to Saudi Arabia, in Abha and then finally returning to Madinah around 1357/1938.<br /><br />After a very period in Madinah the Shaykh returned to his native homeland of Mali. While in Mali the Shaykh spread Tawhid and Sunnah and clarified the methodology of Salafiyyah. He taught in masajids and schools of Gao as well as the border region between Mali and Niger, he also, very often had disputes and discourses with the Sufis, who were undoubtedly disturbed by this clear dawah. <br /><br />He spread Tawhid and Sunnah i.e. the way of Ahl al-Sunnah and Salafiyyah in Mali, Niger, northern Nigeria, Ghana and even Burkina Faso. His relatives accepted the dawah and slowly by slowly the dawah spread to such an extent that the Sufi Qadiri’s of Timbuktu were also influenced. <br /><br />They said his approach to dawah was that of moderation and so progression was slow and steady. This perhaps was a good strategy due the oppression and control of the colonial renegades, who were the worst of mankind in their behaviour towards other humans.<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah b. Mahmud al-Madani, was no doubt one of the pioneers of the Salafi Dawah in that region with his efforts spreading the countries cited above. He set a solid structured framework for the dawah to continue and to spread far beyond his region. Gao, today serves as the main region and the central place of Salafi Dawah.<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Abdullah b. Mahmud al-Madani died in 1360/1951 and he left behind some amazing efforts. May Allah accept it from him, forgive all of his sins and enter him into Paradise with a lofty status.

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi<br />(1354H/1935 – 1438H/2017)</span></strong><br /><br />Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br />Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansari<br /><br /><br />The Shaikh and Allamah Abdullah Nasir Rehmani said, “Today I say this while being in a state of great sadness and being emotional, I heard the very upsetting news that the Ustadh al-Ulama al-Muhaddith al-Kabir, Mufassir al-Azim, al-Faqih, Fadhlilatush Shaikh Muhammad Abdullah Amjad, may Allah have mercy and envelope him in it, passed away and journeyed to the hereafter and left the Ahl al-Hadith, this is indeed a calamity for Jama’ah Ahl al-Hadith”<br /><br />He is al-Allamah, al-Muhaddith, the Shaikh al-Shuyukh a-Hadith, the Shaikh ul-Hadith Abdullah Amjad bin Abd al-Aziz bin Jamal ud Din Chathwi.  He was born in 1354H corresponding to1935ce in the village of Dahani in the district of Khanghanagar in the state of Bikanir in India. Some have said he was born in the area of Budhyamal in India. He read the Quran to his father, Abdul Aziz, he also read some of the books of Shaikh Hafiz Muhammad Lakhawi like, Ahwal Akhirat, Zinat Islam and other books to his father.<br /><br />After the partition he moved with his family and some elders to Chak no.36 in the Jaranwala district, which is in the greater district of Faisalabad and to its western side. The Pakistani nomenclature for villages which dates back to British rule is Chak, which is a Punjabi word, which essentially means village and instead of names, numbers and letters are used to identify villages in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The Shaikhs title of Chathwi is from the Urdu word translation of the number 36, which was the village he moved to after migrating from India during the partition.<br /><br />He was the nephew of the great Ahl al-Hadith scholar and the son in law of Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi, who spent his whole life going from institute to institute and teaching the clear meanings from the Quran and Sunnah, giving Hadith it’s due right and superior importance, above and beyond the opinion of men and those who just referred back to the opinion of men within the madhabs.<br /><br />After moving to Pakistan, he joined the madrasah of Mian Muhammad Baqir which was Khadim al-Quran wal-Hadith and at the time Shaikh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi was teaching there. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi remained at this madrasah for 2 years and learnt and studied with Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi.<br /><br />He then moved to Owdanwala and enrolled at Shaikh Sufi Abdullah’s madrasah known as Dar al-Ulum Ta’lim al-Islam. It should be noted Shaykh Sufi Abdullah was not a Sufi as we know the term to denote but rather it was a colloquial term used for pious and righteous people. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad remained here for another two years and studied with versatile scholars like Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf, Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi, Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil and Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi.<br /><br />His fellow students also went onto become major scholars and Shuyukh al-Hadith in their own right from the likes of Shaikh Abdur Rashid Hazarwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith in Dar ul-Hadith in Okara and the Shaykh and Qadi Muhammad Aslam Sayf as well as many others.<br /><br />Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s Quest for Knowledge<br /><br />Shaikh Abdullah Amjad was the nephew of Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi and was was also married to his daughter. When Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi moved from Owdanwala to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad also went with him. While at Okara Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi studied books of Hadith with Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi, he studied the books like Jame Tirmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawud as well as other books on other sciences.<br /><br />From the teachers that were teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in those days was the Hadith Master Shaykh Muhammad Abduh al-Falah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad had the opportunity to study books Hujjatullah al-Balighah, Mutanaba, Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi and others with him. Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was fulfilling the role of Musnad as Shaykh ul-Hadith and so in this regard Shaykh Abdullah Amjad studied Sahih al-Bukhari, Tafsir Baidhawi as well as other important books of the sacred science of advanced level.<br /><br />During these years and specifically around 1953 the movement for upholding and honouring the Finality of the Prophethood was in full force. The government of Pakistan at the time was supporting the Qadiyani’s ie Mirzai’s. The people objected to the beliefs of the Qadiyani’s and their desecration of the Finality of the prophethood. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad was also very instrumental and highly active in this movement ie preserving the honour and finality of the prophet of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam. He along with a few other companions would visit the local areas and he would explain the deviation of these corrupt beliefs, the importance to uphold the honour of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam as well refuting the beliefs of the Qadiyani’s. The Shaykh at the time was just a teenager, perhaps when he was either 17 or 18.<br /><br />When this fitnah subsided Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi continued with his studies, he took the exam for Hujjatullah al-Balighah and the paper was written by the eminent scholar of the Ghaznawi family, namely Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi, the Shaykh Alhamdulillah passed the exams with high marks. Once Shaykh Abdullah Amjad met Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi while in Lahore and Shaykh Ghaznawi asked Shaykh Abdullah Amjad to come to his Institute to teach and he also told him they would bare the complete expenses.<br /><br />This was because Shaykh Abdullah Amjad had already studied a few books with Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq at Shaykh Muhammad Dawud Ghaznawi’s institute known as Dar al-Ulum Taqwiyatul Islam and some books at Jamia Ashrafiyyah. Shaykh Abdullah Amjad declined the kind and benevolent request and explained that he would be teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara whilst also seeking knowledge by studying and reading certain books on the sacred sciences to Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri and Shaykh Abdul Qadir. When Shaykh Dawud Ghaznawi heard that he wanted to study with Shaykh Abdul Mannan, he said to him, to go ahead and continue to study and also teach at the same time. So he studied a few books on mantaq ie logic with him.<br /><br />Thereafter at the behest of Shaykh Mu’in ud-Din Lakhawi, Shaykh Abdullah Amjad began teaching. Shaykh Abdullah Budhyamalwi was already teaching in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara and when Shaykh Abdullah Amjad graduated in 1956 he began teaching at Jamia Muhamadiyyah, this is also where he had spent most of this time learning. After graduating and teaching at Jamia Muhammadiyyah, the people became well acquainted with him, his manners, and deep knowledge of the sacred sciences. Due to the status which Allah granted him, he became known amongst the students who would come to him to seek knowledge.<br /><br />His Teachers<br /><br />He had numerous teachers which include the likes of<br /><br />Shaykh ul -Hadith Wal-Tafsir Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi<br /><br />Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Abduh Falah<br /><br />Shaikh ul-Hadith Wal-Tafsir Muhammad Abdullah Rawpari<br /><br />Shaikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Yaqub<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Bhathwi<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Siddiq Karpalwi<br /><br />Shaykh Abdus Samad Rauf<br /><br />Shaikh Muhammad Yaqub Quraishi<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Sadiq Khalil<br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad Ishaq<br /><br />Shaykh Abdul Mannan Kamelpuri<br /><br />Shaykh Abdul Qadir<br /><br />His Legacy as a Teacher Over Half a Millennia<br /><br />The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 4 years, during which time he taught, Sunan Nasai, Mishkat al-Masabih, Jame Tirmidhi, Tafsir Jame al-Bayan, Kafiyyah, Talkhis al-Miftah, al-Fiyyah and other books.<br /><br />Thereafter the Shaykh ul-Hadith Abdullah Veruvalwi spoke to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and asked him to come to Faisalabad to Dar al-Quran wal-Hadith, during the same year Shaikh Abdullah Budhyamalwi who was the Shaykh ul-Hadith also left Jamia Muhamamdiyyah and went to Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad.<br /><br />Shaykh Abdullah Amjad taught in Dar Al-Quran wal-Hadith in Faisalabad for 4 years, thereafter Shaikh Ismail Salafi requested Shaikh Abdullah Amjad to come to teach Jamia Salafiyyah in Faisalabad where he taught the Muwatta of Imam Malik, Mukhtasar al-Ma’ani and Musallam al-Thabut. He remained in Jamia Salafiyyah for a whole year and also taught other books.<br /><br />Thereafter at the behest of his teachers Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah and Shaikh Mu’in al-Din Lakhawi he returned to Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara by fulfilling the request of his teachers. During his first year there he taught Sahih Muslim, Sharh Aqaid al-Nasafi, Muwatta Imam Malik, Sunan Abi Dawud as well as other books. At the time Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah was the Shaikh al-Hadith and in 1970 Shaikh Muhammad Abduh Falah transferred to Jamia Ulum al-Athariyyah which was another learning institute in Faisalabad and so Shaikh Mu’in al-Din Lakhawi gave the position to Shaykh Abdullah Amjad and made him the Shaykh ul-Hadith of Jamia Muhamamdiyyah. In total and in general Shaikh Abdullah Amjad taught in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for 18 or so years and also taught Sahih al-Bukhari for a number of years.<br /><br />During the years 1973-1974 the problems of the Finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu alayhi wasallam remerged and Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and Shaikh Mu’in al-Din Lakhawi were fervent in the movement to preserve the finality of the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and their severe refutation of the Qadiyaniyyah. Eventually both Shaikhs were arrested and put into prison and numerous other people were also with them in prison. The Shaikh continued delivering lessons and sermons on the Quran and its explanation while in prison.<br /><br />The Shaykh continued to teach in Jamia Muhammadiyyah for a few years after he was released from prison and thereafter the Shaikh went to a village called Pak Patan which was next to a place called Arifwala. In Pak Patan the Shaikh taught in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam for approximately 10 years, despite the fact Shaikh Mu’in ud-Din tried to stop him from leaving Jamia Muhamamdiyyah, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad replied that he had given his word.<br /><br />After 10 years in Jamia Ishat ul-Islam he moved to Arifwala at the request of the Ahl al-Hadith people there. The Shaikh further spend 1 and half years teaching in Arifwala, after this period the administrators of the institute were having financial problems and had to let the Shaikh move on. During this time the Ahl al-Hadith brothers at Chichawatni learnt of the circumstances and thus some of the elders went to Arifwala and asked the Shaikh, the other teachers as well as all of the students to all come to Chichawatni and the Shaikh began teaching at their institute, Jamia Ishat al-Ulum al-Muhammadiyyah. The Shaikh remained here for 1 year and due to unforeseen circumstances the Shaikh had to leave.<br /><br />Thereafter, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi and other respected people met Shaikh Abdullah Amjad and requested that he come and teach at their institute of Dar al-Dawah aAl-Salafiyyah situated at Satyana Bangla, which was situated in the district of Faisalabad. Since leaving Chichawatni, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad remained in Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah as the Shaykh ul-Hadith and Mufti and this is where he continued to teach until he died this week from approximately 1993, making it approximately 24 years of teaching in Satyana Bangla.<br /><br />While in Satyana Bangla the Shaikh taught many books as one can imagine, he taught for example, Hidayah, Tafsir Baidhawi and of course Sahih al-Bukhari.<br /><br />The Shaikh apart from his usual lessons would also deliver lessons and lectures on the explanation of the Quran during the whole month of Ramadhan, which he continued for 30 or more years which the students would benefit from immensely.<br /><br />This is the Shaikh giving a lesson on the Quran in Satyana Bangla, Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah SEE HERE<br /><br />salafiyyah2<br /><br />Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Satyana Bangla<br /><br />Chronology of his Teaching<br /><br />Jamia Muhammadiyyah, Okara 4 years, 1956-60<br /><br />Dar al-Quran Wal-Hadith, Faisalabad 4 years, 1960-65<br /><br />Jamia Salafiyyah,Faisalabad, 1 year, 1965-66<br /><br />Jamia Muhammadiyyah, Okara 14 years, 1966-80<br /><br />Jamia Ishat ul-Islam, Pak Patan 10 years, 1980-90<br /><br />Arifwala, 1 and half years, 1990-92<br /><br />Jamia Ishat al-Ulum Muhammadiyyah, Chichawatni, 1 year 1992-93<br /><br />Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Satyana Bangla 24 years, 1993-2017.<br /><br />The Shaykh has been teaching from approximately 1956 and has continued to teach well over half a millennia and probably closer to 60 years or so. In this regard he has taught classical fundamental texts numerous times, year in year out. He has taught the Muwatta Imam Malik many times as well as teaching Sahih al-Bukhari at least 40 times. Besides being an expert and specialist teacher he was also an excellent orator. He also had an analytical debating mind and would often engage in discussions with the people of knowledge of the various different methodologies.<br /><br />salafiyyahbuk<br /><br />Shaikh Abdullah Amjad Teaching Bukhari<br /><br />The Shaikh loved to teach Bukhari and he would thus teach it with great diligence with giving each Hadith, the narrators and the points of benefit it’s due right and attention. He would take his time and make sure every student had understood each point. He would test them on a regular basis and the students in the same way would come prepared. At times if the students were ill prepared the Shaikh would be very firm and reprimand them, he would explain the lesson to them and then later show them kindness and highlight the importance to learn and memorise the knowledge. Some days the Shaikh would deliver two and sometimes even three lessons in a single day on Bukhari, which showed his love for this tremendous book on the saying of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi wasallam.<br /><br />The rector of Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi informed us, the day before his death on the 14th of August 2017, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad gave his usual lesson on Bukhari and the the students were eventually dismissed but he wished to continue teaching as he did not feel content. So the students returned and the Shaikh continued with his explanation and lesson on Bukhari which he then finished for a second time.<br /><br />Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi also mentions on the same day on the 14th of August 2017, there was a meeting at the university and the discussion was regarding starting a new class in a particular location and the idea was that any teacher that lived near the location should deliver it for convenience’s sake. However, none of the other teachers volunteered to take the role of teaching or beginning the class. So Shaikh Abdullah Amjad decided to deliver the first lesson for the opening of the class. Shaikh Abdullah Amjad delivered the lesson after Maghrib for approximately 1 and half hours on explaining the Quran.<br /><br />salafiyyah1<br /><br />Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah, Satyana Bangla<br /><br />Shaikh Atiqullah Salafi said I have known Shaikh Abdullah Amjad for over 2 decades and in all the time I have known him as teacher at Dar al-Dawah al-Salafiyyah he has never taken a single day holiday or time off, he never came late, not even a minute, he never wasted anytime time especially of the students. Another student mentioned that once the Shaikh was extremely ill with severe fever but the Shaikh still came to teach without missing the day.<br /><br />The Shaikh was very simple in nature, without excessive talking and would only speak when needed. He would spend hours with students teaching them and answering questions when needed. Sometimes students would visit him throughout the day asking questions. Sometimes other dignitaries and students would come to visit him to ask questions and to benefit from him. When the people would ask him questions he would reply to them strictly from the Quran and Hadith and he would also give the references for the Hadith.<br /><br />The Shaikh also had another unique characteristic in that when he would answer questions and provide evidences he would also add any further discussions that could arise from the evidences. So he would say the answer is this Hadith and if someone claims such and such then the answer to that is this Hadith etc and this is how the Shaikh would cover all possible alternative issues when people would ask him questions. It was such unique characteristics that raised Shaikh Abdullah Amjads rank as a highly proficient Mufti.<br /><br />salafiyyah-bukha2<br /><br />Shaikh Abdullah Answering Questions as the Mufti<br /><br />The Shaikh would also travel to Raiwind to deliver the Friday Khutbah which was periodically over 40 years, Raiwind is approximately 109Km / 68 Miles directly from Faisalabad but driving via the main roads takes in excess of 2 and half hours one way. So one can imagine the diligence and the effort Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would endure to deliver a Friday Khutbah and with this it must also be noted which is by no means an easy journey at such tender ages past the age of 60 and then doing this for 40 years periodically, at least once a month is something one needs to be in awe of.<br /><br />During one Khutbah in 1999 the Shaikh began to vomit blood but he continued and finished the Khutbah. The Shaikhs sermons would last 50 minutes or so and the people Alhamdulillah would listen attentively without showing any signs or disengagement. Thereafter the Shaikh limited his visitations and reduced his sermon times. It is very evident such students who learnt and listened to the Shaikh are the ones who benefitted the most and hence became scholars and students of the sacred sciences.<br /><br />The Shaikh was extremely humble and filled with immense humility, when people would ask him questions he would refer them to his students while saying they have good knowledge on this subject. Once a person asked him a question pertaining to Hadith and the angle was from rejecting Hadith, so Shaikh Abdullah Amjad told him to go to his student, Shaikh Irshad ul-Haq Athari. This shows his humility and the status of his students.<br /><br />Another time he was delivering a lecture and there were other scholars on the stage and so Shaikh Abdullah said, these Mashaikh are perhaps younger than me in age but they have more knowledge than me. This was from the Shaikhs humility, wara and taqwa. The reality was none of the Shaikhs were even near Shaikh Abdullah’s knowledge.<br /><br />The Shaikh had hundreds of students whilst teaching for over half a millennia and making a list of all of them would be near enough impossible. The Shaikh would always ask about his students, how they were and what they were doing, he would always convey his Salam to them. Sometimes visitors would come to him and he would ask them about his student who had studied with many many years ago and at times over a decade ago. This shows the love of a teacher for his students, that even after graduating he remembered them wishing them good.<br /><br />Aside from the daily teaching routine, Shaikh Abdullah Amjad would visit the students in their quarters everyday after Asr, where the students would ask general questions and issues related to their subjects and curriculum, the Shaikh would answer them with great patience and comprehension.<br /><br />The Shaikh would also look after his health and this is evident because the Shaikh died at an old age, and all praise is for Allah the giver of life. Once the students asked Shaikh Abdullah Amjad what his daily routine was. He replied that whilst he was a student and teacher in Jamia Muhammadiyyah in Okara, he would eat two apples everyday and he would play volleyball between Asr and Maghrib.<br /><br />The Shaikhs Students<br /><br />A teacher is often recognised by the calibre of his students. From them are the likes of<br /><br />The Allamah and Muhaddith Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari<br /><br />shaikhs-irshad-and-amjad<br /><br />Shaikh Irshad humbily Greeting Shaikh Abdullah Amjad<br /><br />He is well known for his knowledge and especially the science of Hadith. He has many detailed books on Hadith and narrators and also his specialty in correcting the false notions and errors of the hanafi madhab. His book I’la Al-Sunan Fil Mizan is a testimony to this. He also has numerous other books that are highly beneficial. His is one of the instrumental scholars who has kept the people of innovation at bay, so much so that one of the heads and defenders of the hanafi and deobandi madhab in Pakistan had to say about Shaikh Irshad that we ie the hanafis and deobandi cannot take charge of the Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi’s while their Ibn Taymiyyah of this era is around, and he was referring to Shaykh Irshad ul-Haq al-Athari.<br /><br />When the Shaykh is of this calibre and status, one would naturally would like to know who his teachers are, since they produced such a brilliant student and scholar in his own right. Approximately 1999-2000 Shaykh Irshad ul-Haqq al-Athari visited England and Alhamdulillah we spend every second of our time with him, so upon asking him who his teachers were he mentioned Shaykh Abdullah Amjad Chathwi as one of them. So from that day we were acquainted with the Shaikh and then every so often upon reading the biographies of some of the other Shuyukh, we would read Shaikh Abdullah Amjad’s name as one of the teachers.<br /><br />sh-irshad-and-amjad<br /><br />Shaikh Abdullah Amjad talking to his student, Shaikh Irshad<br /><br />Shaikh Abdul Aziz Al-Alawi – He is a shaykh ul Hadith is Jamia Salafi Faisalabad<br /><br />Shaykh Hafiz Abdul Manan Nurpuri – the well known Salafi and Usuli Scholar who subdued the people of innovation and falsehood.

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The ʾAllāmah, Muḥaddith Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī<br />(1338-1438H / 1920-2017)</span></strong><br /><br />One of the last remaining radiant Scholars of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth and Salafī's, the Muḥaddith ʾAllāmah Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī passed away a few days and returned to our Glorious Creator.<br /><br />Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Mubārakpūrī was a formidable scholar, upright, just with exemplary manners, he had profound love for the Qurʿān and Ḥadīth and his love to constantly narrate Ḥadīth. his love of Ḥadīth and its people made him travel continents to spread the divine texts.<br /><br />Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī was born in his native area of Mubārakpūr approximately between 1338-1339H (one reports mentions 1341H, however we do not know how accurate this is) corresponding to 1920c. The Shaykh began receiving his early education in his native area and eventually in 1940 enrolled at the prestigious and world famous Jāmia Reḥmanyyah Ahl al-Ḥadīth Salafi learning institute in Delhi, India.<br /><br />Jāmia Reḥmaniyyah was an outstanding learning institute, which essentially focussed on spreading and teaching the Qurʿān and Ḥadīth. Their teachings heavily focussed on Ḥadīth and is sciences and focussed on its meaning, understanding and the extrapolated points of benefit ranging from ʾAqīdah to matters which soften the heart. An example of its love for the pristine divine Ḥadīth, its teaching and people can be highlighted by the following example which Shaykh Ẓafar al-Ḥasan al-Madanī narrated to us in the United Kingdom,<br /><br />&quot;Once a well known scholar (Salafī inShāʿAllāh) was visiting Jāmia Reḥmaniyyah and he wanted to visit the designated place where the Shaykh ul-Ḥadīth would deliver their lessons explaining the Prophet Hadith. At the time the university had a designated place where they would only teach Ḥadīth. This scholar had a very short beard, (perhaps shorter than a fist), he requested to see the place where they teach Ḥadīth and also wanted to see how a lesson was conducted. At the time the Shaykh ul-Hadith was Shaykh ʾUbaidullāh Reḥmanī Mubarakpūrī who was teaching Ḥadīth at the time. When he was asked such and such person wants to come to this hall and observe the lesson, Shaykh ʾUbaidullāh denied the request and said this place is where we teach the Prophets Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallams Sunnah and Ḥadīth and therefore everything here has to be according to the Sunnah and Hadith and because the guest's beard is not according to the Sunnah we kindly request that he is shown some other part of the university.&quot;<br /><br />This was their love for the Sunnah and Ḥadīth, sadly during the years of partition the university was badly desecrated with most of its books, rare manuscripts and manuscripts of unpublished books and teachers notes were all destroyed. The university was later moved to Karachī in Pākistān but it was not the same.<br /><br />When Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī enrolled in 1940 he learnt the islamic sciences from some of the colossal Salafi Hadith Masters who were experts in the sacred sciences especially Hadith, thus, while at Jāmia Reḥmaniyyah Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī learnt the sciences from the likes of<br /><br />1. The Shaykh the ʾAllāmah the Muḥaddith Abul Uʾla ʾAbd al-Raḥman Mubārakpūrī (d.1353H/1934)<br />2. The Usūlū, the Muhaddith Shaykh Ahmadullah Partabghari (d.1362H/1943)<br />3. The Muḥaddith and ʾAllāmah Shaykh ʾUbaidullāh Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī (d.1414H/1994)<br />4. The Nāqiḍ, Shaykh Nazir Aḥmad Reḥmānī Amlawī (d.1385H/1965)<br /><br />After graduating he taught in various institutes in India and then eventually spent a long time teaching in Jāmia Dār us-Salām in Umrabād. Where the students then spread to the various lands in the quest to spread the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. So much so that some of those who learnt from him reside in the west.<br /><br />The Shaykh would travel extensively throughout the different lands even as far as the USA where he would conduct seminars and lessons in reading the Prophetic Ḥadīth and he would give ijāzāt to the people. These Hadith reading sessions would also be conducted in the Arab lands and the ʾUlamāʿ would flock to his Hadith reading sessions in order to get ijāzahs.<br /><br />The Shaykh had two routes to Shaykh al-ʾAllāmah al-Muḥaddith Nazir Ḥussain Dehlawī (d.1320H/1902) with only one person in the chain to him, the first was through Shaykh ʾAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mubārakpūrī and the Usūlī the Muḥaddith, Shaykh Ahmadullāh Partābgharī.<br /><br />This Chain back to the Messenger of Allāh  Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam through Jāmia Reḥmaniyyah is known as Silsilah Reḥmaniyyah and it reaches our Noble Prophet Salalahu Alayhi Wasallam in 25 links and it is the by far the undisputed shortest chain back to Noble Prophet Salalahu Alayhi Wasallam with the complete Samaʾa of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim. With 21 links to Imam Muslim from Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī and then the 4 rubaʾiyāt to the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, making us the 26th link<br /><br />The Sama'a from Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī to Shaykh Shāh Waliullāh Dehlawī has 5 links <br /> <br />Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī (d.1438H) who narrates the complete Sahih Muslim from<br />Ahmadullāh Partābgharī (d.1362) who narrates the complete Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from<br />Naẓīr Ḥusain al-Dehlawī (d.1320H) who narrates the complete Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from<br />Muhammad Ishāq al-Dehlawī (1262H) who narrates the complete Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from<br />Shāh ʿAbdul ʾAzīz al-Dehlawī (d.1239H) who narrates the complete Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from<br />Shāh Waliullāh al-Dehlawī (d.1176H) who narrates the complete Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from<br /><br />who has 21 chains to<br /><br />Imam Muslim (d.261H)<br /><br />with 4 people in the chain<br /><br />to the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu alayhi Wasallam<br /><br />Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī  also had complete Samaʾa of Muslim from Shaykh Ahmadullāh Partābgharī who in turn had complete sama'a from the Yemenī Muḥaddith Shaykh Ḥusain ibn Muḥsin al-Anṣārīi (d.1327H) and therefore therefore Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī had two chains which strengthens this unique short chain, way shorter than any of the Deobandī's and Barelwī's<br /><br />Also please note this is only for one book, there are many chains for the other books of Ḥadīth and Samaʾa through other scholars like Shaykh ʾAbd al-Raḥman al-Mubārakpūrī<br /><br />This being said brothers at Salafi Research Institute have an even shorter chain than the one above which omits both Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī and Shaikh Ahmadullāh Partābgharī with only a stupendously shortest link of only 23 links, Wa Lillahil Ḥamd<br /><br />The brothers at Salafi Research Institute had also been trying for last 6-9 months for Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī to come to the UK for Hadith reading sessions for ijāzāt's and Alḥamdulillāh he agreed however Allah is the best of planners and this Noble Scholar of the Ahl al-Ḥadīth returned to our Creator. Some of the brothers also have ijāzahs directly from the Shaykh wa Lillahil Ḥamd<br /><br />We pray and supplicate to Allāh, the Mighty and Majestic, who is above his Throne and has infinite mercy on Shaykh Ẓahīr al-Dīn Reḥmānī Mubārakpūrī, forgives him, his shortcomings and makes his good scales very heavy on Yaum al-Qiyāmah.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Biography of Ibn Qudaamah – rahimahullah –</span></strong><br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His name and his lineage:</span></strong><br />He is Muwaffaq ad-Deen Aboo Muhammad, ‘Abd-Allah bin Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Qudaamah bin Miqdaam bin Nasir bin ‘Abd-Allah al-Maqdisee, then later became ad-Dimashqee, as-Saalihee.<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His birth:</span></strong><br />He was born in Sha’baan in the year 541 H., in the village of Jammaa’eel, Jabal Naablus.<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His early life (youth) and his travels:</span></strong><br />- He went to Damascus with his family when he was ten years old, he read the Qur’an, and he memorized the Mukhtasar (Summary / Compendium) (of) al-Khiraqee.<br /><br />- He travelled to Baghdaad with the son of his aunt (maternal cousin) al-Haafidh ‘Abd al-Ghanee in the year 561 H. and they heard a lot from the many mashaayeekh (scholars) there.<br /><br />- He studied (Islamic) jurisprudence (fiqh) until he surpassed his peers/equals and he was very successful, thus he mastered the knowledge of the madhhab (school of law) and its principles.<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His piety and his asceticism (zuhd):</span></strong><br />He was pious, ascetic, God-fearing, consequently he had dignity, and he possessed tolerance and leniency, and all of his time he was preoccupied with knowledge and action, he would counter disputes with arguments and proofs/evidences, he would not become enraged or aroused, while his opponents would scream and become angry.<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His shuyukh:</span></strong><br />The shaykh ibn Qudaamah rahimahullah obtained knowledge from a big amount of scholars and from the more famous of them were Taqee ad-Deen Aboo Muhammad ‘Abd al-Ghanee al-Maqdisee – d. in 612 H. – and the Faqeeh of al-‘Iraaq the Advisor of Islaam Abaa al-Fath Nasir bin Fityaan better known by the name Bin al-Mannaa.<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His students:</span></strong><br />He had a lot of students and from the more famous of them were Shihaab ad-Deen Aboo Shaamah al-Maqdisee – d. 665 H. – and al-Haafidh Zakee ad-Deen Aboo Muhammad al-Mundhiree – d. 656 H. – and others (of them).<br /><br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Statements from the learned about him:</span></strong><br />Aboo ‘Amr bin as-Salaah said: «I didn’t see anyone like ash-shaykh Muwaffaq».<br /><br />Ibn Taymiyyah said: «No one possessing more understanding of the religion – fiqh – entered ash-Shaam - after al-Awzaa'ee - other than ash-shaykh al-Muwaffaq».<br />Al-Mundhiree said: «He was al-Faqeeh al-Imaam, he narrated (ahaadeeth) in Damascus, he issued fatawaa and taught/gave lessons, he wrote books in fiqh and other subjects, summarized and long».<br /><br />Adh-Dhahabee said: «He was one of the eminent imaams and an author of many books».<br /><br />Ibn Kathir said: «Shaykh al-Islam, an imaam an ‘aalim, proficient, there was not found in his era nor before it by a long span of time, anyone possessing more fiqh – understanding of the religion – than him.»<br /><br />۩ <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">His writings</span></strong><br />And the writings of the imaam al-Muwaffaq are already plenty and they reach the level of excellence of the learned: Ibn Rajab said: «ash-shaykh al-Muwaffaq – rahimahullah – wrote a lot of good works on the madhhab, on the branches and on principles, in the (science) of al-hadeeth and the language and asceticism and the heart softeners, and his writings in usool ad-deen reach a level of high quality, a lot of them were on the path of the muhadditheen (the hadith – scholars), full of al-ahadeeth and al-aathaar and al-asaaneed (chains of narration), like the path/way of imaam Ahmad and the scholars of al-hadeeth.»<br /><br /><br /><em>And from these writings are:</em><br /><br /><ul>In the (Islamic) jurisprudence / fiqh: al-Mughnee, al-Kaafee, al-‘Uddah, al-‘Umdah (al-Fiqh), and al-Muqna’….<br /><br />In al-‘aqeedah : Luma’at al-‘Itiqaad, al-Qad(a)r, Dhamm al-Taa-weel….<br /><br />In usool al-fiqh : Rawdat an-Naazhir…<br /><br />In raqaa’iq and ascetism: ar-Riqqah wa’l-Bukaa and at-Tawwaabeen.<br /><br />(In al-hadeeth) : Mukhtasar al-‘Ilal al-Hadeeth li’l-Khalaal….<br /><br />He has got other writings as well, which are between the stages of print and manuscript, we ask Allah to enable us to see the light (of guidance of these books) at a near time.</ul><br /><br />For discussion at length of the biography of Ibn Qudaamah turn to:<br /><br /><ul>1. at-Takmilah fee Wafee-aat an-Naqlah by al-Mundhiree (3/107)<br />2. al-‘Ibr fee Khabar min Ghabr by adh-Dhahabee (5/79-80)<br />3.

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Examples of Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad’s Piety</span></strong><br /><br />When the Shaikh served as president of the Islamic University of Madeenah, he didn’t abuse his position and take it as an opportunity to oppress the workers and employees. Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree relates: “I went to the University at the time of ‘Asr when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as its president. And there would be no one in the University except for him and me. So I said to him: ‘Why don’t you bring someone who will open the University for you before you come?’ He replied: ‘I will not make anybody work at this time because it is a time of rest.’ This was at the time of ‘Asr.”<br /><br />One graduate from the University related that when the Shaikh was president there he would not like to stop the university car on the road to buy things for the house. Meaning: Since the car was just to take him to and from work, he would not like to abuse this by using it for personal reasons.<br /><br />On another occasion, when his term of presidency ended, his driver saw him standing on the street waiting, so he passed by him as usual and offered to take him home, but he replied: “I wouldn’t think of it. My term as president has ended and I called my son to come and get me.”<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://scholars-biographies.com/2013/08/15/biography-of-shaykh-abdul-muhsin-al-abbaad-hafidhahullah/">http://scholars-biographies.com/2013/08 ... dhahullah/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 10:55 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Did Abu Hurayrah (Radhiallahu Anhu) Taunt Or Disrespect The Other Sahaabah (RadhiAllahu Anhum) Who Knew Less Than Him? </span></strong><br /><br />Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan Ibn ‘Uyainah reported to us from Az-Zuhree from Al-A’araj that he said: I heard Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) say:<br /><br />&quot;Indeed, you claim that Abu Hurairah has memorized many ahaadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger. I swear by Allaah, I used to be a poor man and I would serve Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in order to fill my belly (with food). The Muhaajiroon would be involved with their business transactions in the market places40 and the Ansaar would be preoccupied with directing their funds.[1] So the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: 'Whosoever outspreads his garment, then he will never forget anything that he hears from me.' So, I spread my garment out until he finished (narrating) his hadeeth and I then gathered it up to myself. And I did not forget anything that I heard after that.'&quot;<br /><br /><em>[1] The shi`as use this particular point to argue as mentioned in the subject. Though they can be refuted using other narrations but why do that when we can refute them from a similar narration.</em> <br /><br />So, know that there is not found in this description (by Abu Hurayra) of the Muhaajireen, and likewise this description of the Ansaar, any reviling or derogation of them, as many of the contemporary writers that slander Abu Hurairah (radhiallaahu ‘anhu) without due right claim. This goes as well for those who interpret his sayings in a way contrary to what he intended. Indeed, doing an action in addition to seeking the halaal is from the Way of Allaah, as has been reported authentically in some ahaadeeth. And Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was aware of this, for he was one of the reporters. Thus, he made excuses for them in regard to that matter for (their lack) of memorizing hadeeth the way he was able to memorize.<br /><br />Al-Haakim (3/511-512) reported from Talha Ibn 'Ubaidillaah, one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and one of the Muhaajireen and first Muslims, that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said concerning the Muhaajireen and Abu Hurairah something similar to this hadeeth: <br /><br />&quot;By Allaah, I have no doubt that Abu Hurairah heard from the Messenger of Allaah, that which we did not hear and he learned that which we did not learn. Verily, we were rich people, in possession of houses and large families. We used to go and stay with the Prophet until the end of the day, then we used to go back. And Abu Hurairah was a poor person. He had no money nor family nor children. His hand was only where the Prophet's hand was. And he used to stay over wherever he resided. And we have no doubt that he learned what we didn't learn and that he heard what we didn't hear. And no one among us accuses him.&quot; <br /><br /><em>Al-Haakim authenticated it and Al-Haafidh mentioned a supporting evidence for it in Fath-ul-Baaree (1/191).</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 10:49 pm</p><hr />

So the Shaikh said, ‘Subhaanallaah! Why aren’t you desirous of the reward?’ So one of those there read something and after he finished reciting the Shaikh started to explain the excellence of reciting and then he explained the very verses that were recited.
