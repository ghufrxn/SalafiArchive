<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-26-</strong><br /><br />How the Salaf dealt with innovators, and they were not necessarily the heads. We find an incident as mentioned by al-Uqayli, he said:<br /><br /><strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #BF4000">Mu'adh b. Mu'adh said:<br /><br />I was with Sawwar b. Abdullah when a servant entered and said: &quot;Zufar is at the door!&quot; Sawwar said: &quot;The Zufar who belongs to the school of opinion (Ahl al-Ra'yy)? Do not let him in, for he is a innovator (Mubtadi)&quot; One of the people present said: &quot;He is your cousin, who has been on a journey. You have not gone to him, He has come to you, It is better to let him in.&quot;<br /><br />So Sawwar let him in. Zufar came in and gave us Salam, but i did not hear Zawwar reply to him. I saw Zufar holding out his hand, but Sawwar did not shake it. Sawwar did not even look at Zufar until stood up and went out. (al-Uqayli, <em>al-Du'afa al-Kabir</em>, 2:98)</span><br /></div></blockquote></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. The Salaf and early scholars were aware and understood that people deviated and they attributed them to groups, sects and parties. In this case it was the school of al-Ra'yy.<br /><br />2. The Salaf refusing to let a man enter his gathering, rebuking and labelling him to be an innovator on account of being from Ahl al-Ra'yy.<br /><br />3. The people present put forward 2 arguments, 1. that he was a cousin ii. He had been on a journey and they also added you have not gone to the innovators, rather they have come to you. This is what the Salafis do today, we do not go to the innovators. <br /><br />4. The Salaf refused to give him Salam despite him putting his hand out. This was perhaps due to many reasons from the way of reprimand, encouragement for him to seek the truth, a warning and so on.<br /><br />5. Not only did the Salaf refuse to give him Salam, he did not even look at him. This was the way of the Salaf, compare this to the stark difference and the reality of the people of today, who not only ask to be invited by the innovators, they sit and mingle with them, enjoy their company, praise and defend them. <br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Mon Jun 22, 2020 11:51 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-25-</strong><br /><br />The Usul of the Madhab of Imam Ahmad is not Always the Hanbali Madhab.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Ahmad said,<br /><br />&quot;Whenever I wrote a Hadith I would always act on it, so when I came across the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, that he had Hijamah done and paid Abu Taybah one Dinar, I also had Hijamah done and I paid the person who did it, one Dinar.&quot; (Tadrib Al-Rawi 2:144, Siyar A'lam al-Nabula  21:312, Al-Manaqib  p.232 or Ibn Al-Jawzi)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. The Importance to seek, learn, understand and write Hadith.<br /><br />2. Imam Ahmad unquestionably based his understanding on Hadith due to his writing them and preserving them and then went onto practise or actualise the Hadith in reality<br /><br />3. The love of Imam Ahmad for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, his Hadith as well as making complete Ittiba of him.<br /><br />4. Imam Ahmad did not hesitate to act on the Hadith, without asking how, why and when, but rather he gave the Hadith reverence and immediately practised it in the same the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did. No excuses of looking at what the scholars of the Madhab said or a single excuse, except that he acted upon the Hadith with the most succinct precision. <br /><br />5. We find this methodology was in reality and in actual fact one of the core principles Imam Ahmad had adopted as part of his understanding in approaching Hadith as well as Fiqh. This was an Asal of his Madhab ie to act upon the Hadith. <br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Sat Dec 23, 2017 11:51 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-24-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Lalika'i said<br /><br />“And it Is found in some of the books of Abi Hatim Muhammad bin Idris ibn al-Mundhir al-Hanzali al-Razi (d.277H), May Allah have mercy on him, from what has been heard from, he said, “Our MADHAB which we have chosen and adopted is to to do ITTIBA ie follow and obey the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), the Sahabah and the Tabi’een and those who followed them in good. And abandoning looking into their innovations. And holding onto the MADHAB of AHL AL-ATHAR from the likes of Abi Abdullah Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, Abi Ubaid al-Qasim bin Salam and al-Shafi’i. And holding firmly on to the Kitab and Sunnah whilst defending the Imams who followed the narrations of the Salaf. Accepting and adopting what the Imams of Ahl al-Sunnah from the different lands adopted from the likes of Malik bin Anas in Madinah, al-Awza’I in Sham, Layth ibn Sa’d in Misr, Sufyan al-Thawri and Hammad ibn Zayd in I’raq for (protection) the events (ie of trials and tribulations) that occurred which could not be found in the narrations from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam), the companions and successors.” (Sharh Usul al-Ei’tiqad Ahl al-Sunnah Wal-Jama’ah (1:180 no.323)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. There was a madhab based on following and obeying ie doing Ittiba of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam). This was also the Madhab of the Salaf.<br /><br />2. In recent times some quarters have attempted to deny the understanding of Ittiba, however the understanding of Imam Abu Hatim al-Razi clearly evidences the understanding the factual reality of Ittiba.<br /><br />3. There being a madhab of the people of narration and reports, Athar, which are the narrations and hadith therefore the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />4. The aforementioned scholars were upon this way, on the madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />5. In every affair the reports from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the companions and successors are looked at.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Sep 26, 2017 7:42 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-23-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Shaykh ul-Islam Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said,<br /><br />&quot;The people who are most worthy to be the saved sect are the Ahl al-Hadith and Sunnah, who do not follow anyone else with any blind attachment except the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and these people are the ones who are most acquainted with his statement and actions.&quot; (Majmu'a Fatawa (3:374)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. The existence and the clear reality of the saved sect, it exists and is as real as it gets with its features.<br /><br />2. The Ahl Al-Hadith and Ahl Al-Sunnah are the saved sect<br /><br />3. These people ie the saved sect, the Ahl Al-Hadith do not make taqlid or blindly follow anyone but yet there is a group of people who blindly follow the opinions and statements of men other than the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).<br /><br />4. The reprehension of following and being blind for someone other than the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).<br /><br />5. A sign of the saved sect, the Ahl Al-Hadith is their knowledge, study and comprehension of the statements and actions of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) which can be considered a hallmark of the Ahl Al-Hadith and Salafis and yet at the same instance others are ardently busy with the opinions and rulings of others who are from the Ummah of Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Wed Jul 05, 2017 1:51 am</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-22-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />al-Imam al-Hafiz Qawam as-Sunnah Abul Qasim Ismail bin Muhammad al-Asbahani said<br />“Some of the scholars have said that the reasons people have split away from the Ahlus Sunnah are based upon seven premises for which the sects have become misguided:1) Their position regarding the essence {dhaat} of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. 2) Concerning Allah’s Attributes and Names. 3) Concerning the actions of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala. 4) Concerning their position about Iman (belief). 5) Concerning their position on punishment for those who sin. 6) Concerning their belief and position about the Qur’an. 7) Concerning their position about the Kheelafah and Imamate. Ahlus Sunnah is the saved sect which opposes the various other sects in these 7 categories and it takes that which has come from the Qur’an and the authentically proven Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam. For verily Allah Subhanahu wata’ala has said in His Qur’an Soorah Shura Ayah 11: “There is none like him and he Sees and Hears everything.” So we can see from this ayah that there is none like unto Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and we only give the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala which he has given for Himself in His Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam and the people have a consensus upon this. So any individual who goes against the Names and Attributes of Allah which have been mentioned in the Book and Sunnah then he is misguided. We say, that Allah has free will, He is Alive, He Hears, He Sees, He Speaks, He gives life and death, amongst various other Attributes and He has been with these Attributes from the very beginning, eternally. Even though many sects claim that they are upon this way concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah but in reality they have invented innovations into the deen and have fallen into the trials and tribulations of ta’weel (figurative interpretation of the Ashaa’irah) going and following the mutashaabihah (that which is ambiguous from the shariah) whereas, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jam’ah cling to the Book of Allah, the sunnah of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam and the Ijmaa’ of the Salaf us-Saliheen and they do not go outside of this, nor do they try to find a way to make figurative interpretations and ta’weel so that they fall into that which is unclear. The belief which is based upon figurative interpretations against the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the Salaf is an innovation and falls into the saying of the Prophet sallalahu alaihi wasallam, “that which is not from our command, deen is rejected.” (al-Bukhari no.255, Muslim no.1817, al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani volume 2 pgs.409-411)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1.

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-21-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />al-Allamah Abul Muzaffar as-Sam’ani [489H] said “Know O Reader that one of the main differences between Ahlus Sunnah and the Ahlul Bid’ah is the issue of the intellect (aql). The Ahlul bid’ah have made the basis of understanding this religion based upon their intellects therefore any ayah of the Qur’an or any Hadeeth which goes against the intellects they try to explain it away by way of ta’weel or reject it whereas the Ahlus Sunnah say that the foundation of the deen is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the blessed Prophet Muhammed sallalahu alaihi wasallam and it is the intellect which must be in line with that, for verily if the basis of the deen was upon intellect then Allah Subhanahu wata’ala would have had no need to send the revelation or the Prophets and the whole subject of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil through these Prophets would have been left futile and baseless based upon everyone’s own ideas and thoughts. No doubt, it is sufficient to show the fallacy of giving precedence to one’s intellect over the texts established from the Qur’an and the authentic sunnah for one to see that if the basis of the deen was based upon intellect then the believers would have had a choice to leave obeying the ahkaam and obligations set down by Allah and His Messenger up until they did not understand them. However, this is not the case and has never been the case concerning the religion of al-Islaam. So we can see that when we look at many aspects of the religion for example the Names and Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala and various other issues of aqeedah then one thing that becomes clear is that we cannot understand or explain away or even reject the Names or Attributes of Allah Subhanahu wata’ala based upon our intellects for if we did this, then no doubt we would be extremely misguided and the punishment of Allah would be made mandatory for us.” (al-Hujjah fee Bayanil Mahajjah Li Abi Qasim al-Asbahani vol.1 pg.348-349)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1.

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-20-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Awzai said, “O Muslims, fear Allâh and obey Him, and accept the advice of the sincere advisers and the exhortation of the exhorters, and know that this knowledge is religion, so be careful about what you do [in it] and from whom you take [it] and who you follow and who you trust your religion to. For verily, the followers of Bid’ah are all falsifiers and liars, neither are they careful nor do they fear and protect [against wrongdoing], and nor are they to be trusted to not distort what you hear. They say what they know not when criticizing and decrying or when affirming their lies. But Allâh encompasses what they do. So be on guard against them, suspect them, reject them and distance yourselves from them, for this was what your earlier scholars and the righteous latter ones did and instructed others to do. Beware of rising against Allâh and becoming instruments in the destruction of His religion and undoing its handholds by respecting the innovators, for you know what has come down to us about respecting them.And what stronger respect and veneration can there be than taking your religion from them, following them, believing them, being close to them and helping them in alluring those they allure and attracting those they attract of the weak Muslims towards their ideas and the religion they practice? This is enough to be considered a partnership and contribution to what they do.” (Ibn ‘Asâkir, Târîkh Dimishq 6/361-362).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1.

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-19-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />It is reported from al-Abbâs bin al-Waleed that ‘Uqbah said: “I was once with Arta’ah bin al-Mundhir when one of the people in the gathering said, “What do you say about a man who sits with the followers of the Sunnah and mixes with them, but when the followers of Bid’ah are mentioned he says, ‘Spare us from mentioning them, do not talk about them?’” Arta’ah said, “He is one of them, do not let him confuse you about his condition.” I felt this was strange, so I went to al-Awzaa’ee – and he used to clarify these matters when they came to him. He said, “Arta’ah is right, the matter is as he said; this person forbids talking about [Ahlal-Bid’ah], so how can [people] be on guard against them if they are not exposed?” (Ibn ‘Asâkir, Târîkh Dimishq 8:15)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1.Unfortunately, a severe illness has crept in amongst general people today and the people are told that to refute is not the correct way and that this hardens the heart and causes harshness and so on. So consider the aforementioned statement, and consider it over and over again for it encapsulates the manhaj of the salaf, who were the most balanced and kindest of people. <br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 09, 2017 8:25 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-18-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah “Had Allah not made the upright repel the harm of the evil ones {i.e. Ahlul Bidah}, the religion would be corrupted and this corruption is far greater than that being caused when during war the people are conquered. Verily, when they take over a country they do not corrupt and take over the heart and that which is in it related to the deen, but they do it over a long period. On the other hand, the people of Bidah they corrupt the hearts from the outset.” (Majmoo al Fataawa 28:232) (taken from Oh Salafi do not drink from the Well..)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. A profund and deep statement of Imam Taymiyyah in his understanding of the affairs of his time and how this pertinently relates to affairs in our times. <br /><br />2.Ahlul Bidah corrupt the din and the upright people repel and refute them.<br /><br />3. The corruption of Ahlul Bidah is far worse then the turmoil that proceeds when dealing with countries. <br /><br />4. Ahlul Bidah corrupt the people right from the beginning and this is the reason why the Salaf have mentioned numerous severe warnings with regards to having associations with the people of innovation and their underlings. <br /><br />5. The great importance in repelling falsehood and corruption of the people of misguidance and deviation which is to be done by the upright people and the are none other than the righteous and Scholars of Ahlus Sunnah. This also leads to the established principle of returning back the Scholars in all of the affairs and not the modern day quick buck speakers. Let alone those who have assumed authority over dawn and their words which they are not even qualified to say....<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 09, 2017 8:22 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-17-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Ibn Taymiyyah“Some of the people said to Imaam Ahmad that ‘I find it difficult to criticise (narrators in the chain of narrations) that they have some problems and are like so and so? Imaam Ahmad replied, ‘if you and I remain silent, then how will the ignorant one know the authentic from the unauthentic narration?” (Majmoo al-Fataawa 28/231) (taken from Oh Salafi do not drink from the Well..)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. The taqwa of the people during the time of Imam Ahmad.<br /><br />2. The permissibility and understanding of Imam Ahmad and the Salaf in refuting and speaking about the evilness and evil of the people who harm the din.<br /><br />3. Speaking about people who harm and misguide people in this Din is a must and infant one is aiding and helping the Muslims.<br /><br />4. It is not easy to criticise people but it must be done to make distinctions and uphold the vanguard of Islam.<br /><br />5. A lesson for the happy Muslims who are on this understanding, we are all Muslims and let us just unite and be happy!!!!

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-16-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam Ibn Hazm (456H) said &quot;Hold on to the text which has been given to you from Rabb in the Quran and from your Prophet Sallalahu alayhi wasallam via trustworthy narrators from the scholars and Imams of the people of Hadith.&quot; (Kitab al-Fasl 2:116)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. The obligation to accept everything from Quran and Hadith and acknowledging this to be mandatory in every aspect of the din, at the same token showing the significance and great importance of the fundamental sources of Islam.<br /><br />2. This is a clear and manifest refutation of taqlid and it's people ie the madhabists and Ghayr Ahlul Hadith.<br /><br />3. The scholars of Hadith and the Ahlul Hadith were stringent in narrating authentic ahadith.<br /><br />4. The scholars and imams were from amongst the Ahlul Hadith.<br /><br />5. The people of Hadith existed during he fifth 5th century of Islam way before the Ghayr Ahlul Hadith emerged ie the staunch madhabists.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Mar 09, 2017 8:15 pm</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-13-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imaam Qawaam as-Sunnah Imaam Abul Qasim al-Asbahaanee (d.535H) said,<br /><br />“We saw the Ashaabul Hadeeth, and they travelled far and wide to collect the narrations, then they sifted out the weak ones from the authentic narrations, they compiled them and they memorised them. The Ashaabul hadeeth (Ahlul Hadith) then acted upon these narrations and they promoted and spread these narrations this being their dawah and they used the narrations of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam to refute the mukhaalifeen (the opposers).<br /><br />These Ashaabul Hadeeth had with them a vast amount of authentic narrations just like the cloth seller has clothes, the one who sells dates has dates, and the one who sells perfume has perfume! So the one who sold dates becomes known as the date seller and the one who sells clothes becomes known as the clothes seller and the one who sells perfume becomes known as the perfume seller, then similarly the Ashabul Hadith and the scholars of hadith became known as the Ahlul Hadith.<br /><br />When these Ahlul Hadith saw people going away from the ma’roof (that which was known by way of necessitating and following the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) and they could see people leaving the authentic narrations and they could see people from the various sects making tanqeed and making disparaging remarks against the narrations the scholars of hadeeth began to refute these people and began to warn against them in their gatherings. The Ahlul Hadith began to mention the real meanings of the words of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam as they ought to have been understood.<br /><br />So it is fair to say from this evidence that the scholars of hadith who authored all of the works in promoting the ittiba (following) of the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam in reality they are the Ahlus Sunnah and have more of a right to call themselves the Ahlus Sunnah then any other person or group and this is because according to the scholars the real meaning of Sunnah is to follow the authentic chain of narration (hadeeth) from the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam concerning the ahkaam and to act upon that and to stay away from that which has come by way of a forbiddance in these narrations. Thus this is a clear evidence to say that the Ahlul Hadith, Ashabul Hadith are actually none other than the Ahlus Sunnah themselves.<br /><br />If someone was to say that if this is the case then every other sect other than the Ahlul Hadith also mention various narrations as evidences for their beliefs and their actions then what do we say about them? Then our response is, that those which in opposition to an authentic narration bring a weak narration, in opposition to a complete narration, bring a mursal (an incomplete) narration, in opposition to a marfoo’ narration (a narration that reaches with complete chain the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam) bring a mawqoof narration (that which does not reach the Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam but a companion) then they cannot be on the same level as the Ahlul Hadith whichever sect they may be from!<br /><br />The one who follows the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam based on the authentic narrations he is the one who is following a clear evidence and he is the one who is taking his understanding from the authentic narrations, not from the weak or the incomplete narrations which cannot be in comparison to those narrations which are authentic.<br /><br />Thus it is clear that the Ahlus Sunnah is the one who will follow the authentic narrations and go out of his way to follow the authentic narration over and above any other narration or saying, whereas those who are ahlul rai (people of opinion and conjecture) they only follow the narrations which fit well within their hearts and minds.”<br />(al-Hujjah Fee Bayanil Mahajjah (3:413-414)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1. Read this a few times, this statement of this great imam of the Ahlul Hadith and Ahlus Sunnah is self explanatory and a slap in the face of those tho mock the Ahlul Hadith and say &quot;these ahle hadis from the sub continent...&quot; trying to make out they are different, different in that they have no shame in saying oh read the book of Ahlul Bidah and even promoting their scholars.<br /><br />This new wave of individuals portraying themselves as Ahlul Hadith and they are more harmful to Ahlus Sunnah than Ahlul Bidah are.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000BF">www.salafiri.com</span><br /><span style="color: #BF8000">www.forum.salafiri.com  </span>    <br /><span style="color: #FF0000">www.salafiri.bigcartel.com</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/salafiri_com">http://twitter.com/salafiri_com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri">https://www.facebook.com/Salafiri</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2017 12:18 am</p><hr />

<strong>999 Statements In Defence of the Salafi Creed and Manhaj<br /><br />-12-</strong><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Imam al-A'juri said, “That the people who are of knowledge and intellect, whenever they mention an authentic narration from the Messenger of Allah sallalahu alaihi wasallam so it is only the ignoramus who will then say that I only accept that which has come in the Qur’an. It will be said to him ‘you are an individual who has an illness and concerning the likes of you the Messenger of Allah sallahu alaihi wasallam has warned us’.” (ash-Shariah (pg.49)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /><br />1.The people of knowledge, the Scholars or Ahlul Ilm are known to mention the statements of the Messenger of Allah Salalahu Alayhi wasallam and not the fiqh opinions or positions of their respective imams.<br /><br />2. Imam A'juri equates the people of knowledge and Ahlul Ilm to the people of intelligence, not the youthful ones nor the madhabists or muqallids who are ignorant by default.<br /><br />3. The People of Ilm and intelligence present the statements of our Nabi Salallahu alyhi wasalam to the ignorant ones who reject the status of the Sunnah or those from amongst the muqallidin from the madhabs who ardently deny hadith by rejecting them and deliberating avoid acting upon them.<br /><br />4. The Quraniyun or the progressive modernists who want to distort the Quran and Sunnah are ignorant.<br /><br />5. The people of deviation and misguidance are ill and sick.<br /><br />6. The Messenger of Allah salallahu allay wasallam has warned us against such people<br /><br />7. We should also warn against such people and highlight their misguidance and follow his Sunnah and and way of our beloved Nabi salallahu alayhi wasallam.<br /><br />8. The muqallidin are also ignorant as they fall in the same category.<br /><br />9.
