<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Refutation of The Deviant Named Taj Hargey &amp; The Compilation of Hadeeth – ar-Radd Alal-Ilhaadee al-Musammah Bih Taj Hargey</span></strong><br /><em>Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</em><br /><br />Mr Taj Hargey said and we quote<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><ul><em>But the misogynistic clergy defies the Koran text and distorts the reputed sayings (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad (recorded over 250 years after his death) to elevate an archaic pre-Islamic convention into a contemporary religious imperative.</em></ul></span><br /><br /><strong>(Dear Readers we apologise profusely for the emotive language used in the article but taj hargey is well overdue such a response)</strong><br /><br />This statement of mr taj was uttered in disgrace and in his vilification and jihad against the veil in the daily mail dated 12 April 2011. In due course inshaAllaah we will present our response to his jihad and attack on Islam. What we found extremely ignorant and his grave manifestation of his sheer depravity of knowledge was the part in brackets ie the Hadeeth were recorded 250 years after the prophet Muhammad (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam)<br /><br />We don’t know wether to cry or to mourn at this statement especially in light of mr tajs statement, which was yet again another abomination of the truth that he was an imam and a scholar (refer to his appearance on al-Jazeera with David Frost where he makes these fairy claims).<br /><br />This dear readers should not be surprising, as taj hargey the anti veil jihadist, anti islamic and anti muslim, lacks the most basic knowledge of Islaam and yet he portrays total ignorance of the precise and concise sciences of Islaam, which the non muslims especially those amongst the orientalists have acknowledged.<br /><br />At this point there is dismay and sorrow at the British media who in their ignorance and in this era of commercialism use mr taj as a puppet and their mouth peice with the sole intention of increasing their numbers. In addition taj hargey uses his vile tongue to attack the salafis and Ahlus Sunnah, so we say directly to taj if you want to say something about Islam and the salafis and they say it to us and we shall see what your all about and be sure to receive an adequate response.<br /><br />We say openly to mr taj hargey, you claim that your an imam and a scholar, we dare you to refute the following information, and if you can not then remain silent, shut up, stop presenting yourself as being totally ignorant in the media and stop waisting the precious oxygen we have left.<br /><br />Taj hargey is and continues to spread discord, disunity and harm to the muslims and at the same time spreads terror amongst the muslims via his jihad against the veil. taj hargey should be ignored and passed as a trouble maker.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">ALL BEFORE 250H<br />SAHEEFAH AS-SAHEEHAH</span></strong><br /><br />The Sunnah and Hadeeth were categorically compiled during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam). The illustrious and noble companion Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrated Hadeeth to his students namely Hummaan Ibn Munabbeh bin Kaamil as-Sana’anee, who was a reliable successor and who died in the year 132H. These students wrote down these ahadeeth and as such this compendium became known as as-Saheefah as-Saheehah which commonly became known as Saheehfah Hummaam Ibn Munnabeh.<br /><br />By default this compendium was at the very least compiled in the very first century of Islaam, let alone the far fetched vacant claim of 250H and we will continue to inshaAllaah show the absurdity of this claim by this ‘imam and scholar.’ This compendium has approximately 139 ahadeeth. The later scholars and compilers of Hadeeth then utilised this first compilation and included some Hadeeth from it in their respective collections.<br /><br /><ul>Imaam Ahmad included all of Hummams Saheefah in his Musnad (FACT)<br />Imaam Abdur Razzaaq as-Sana’anee included 61 of his narrations in his Musannaf (FACT)<br />Imaam Bukhaari included 52 of his narrations (FACT)<br />Imaam Muslim used 83 of his narrations (FACT)<br />And Imaam Baghawee used 97 of his narrations. (FACT)</ul><br />So Hummaams Saheefah was included by the compilers in their respective books of hadeeth but the the actual book of Hummaam was unavaible.<br /><br />This was until Dr Hameedullaah found Hummaams book in manuscript form in a library in Berlin, Germany in 1933. He also found another manuscript in Damascus, Syria and whilst comparing both edition of the Saheefah he published his book from India in 1955 and the most interesting aspect was that there was not a single difference between the 2 manuscripts.<br /><br />What further adds to this amazement is that both of these manuscripts were corroborated with the ahadeeth which Imaam Ahmad included in his Musnad, as Imaam Ahmad included Hummaams whole book in his Musnad and astonishingly there was just a slight difference in wording.<br /><br />So Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) died in 56H and Imaam Ahmad died in 240H so in a period of approximately 190 years there was no difference in any of these narrations. This point further refutes the unintelligent self proclaimed scholars who say the ahadeeth could have changed or have been altered whereas this is a prime example of the fallacy and the spurious nature of their weak and futile arguments.<br /><br />There are further points to this argument and inshaAllaah we will present this at a different time as our unscathing refutation of taj hargey and his blind followers at this moment in time is their retarded notion of the hadeeth being compiled after 250H.<br /><br />The interesting thing is Hummaam Ibn Munabbeh heard all the ahadeeth from Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) who died in 58H and so this conclusively establishes that the first compendium of hadeeth must have been compiled around or before 58H as Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) would tell Hummaam ibn Munabbeh to write the hadeeth from him.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE BOOK OF ALEE BIN ABEE TAALIB (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</span></strong><br /><br />Further more Alee ibn Abee Taalib [40H] also has a small compilation Of hadeeth with him, which although were pertaining to certain aspects of Islaam, they were compiled well before 250H. (Refer to Saheeh al-Bukhaari no.111, Sunan Tirmidhee no.1412). Just in case some of the cohorts of taj hargey were confused this implies such a compilation must been authored before or at the very least at 40H<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE SAHEEFAH AS-SAADIQAH</span></strong><br /><br />Similarly Abdullaah ibn Amr [65H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) also authored a small comilation of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) which was known as as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah and all of this can also be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. The well known scholar of hadeeth and Muslim historian, Ibn Atheer said this compilation of the Prophetic Hadeeth contained at least 1000 ahadeeth. (Refer to Ibn Atheers Asad al-Ghaabah FeeTarjamah as-Sahaabah (3/233).<br /><br />The illustrious companion Abdullaah Ibn Amr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said himself, “The as-Saheefah as-Saadiqah is a book which i wrote concerning whatever i heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and there was no one between me and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) (when i heard them from him) (Taqayyad al-Ilm (pg.82), Asad al-Ghaabah (3/234)<br /><br />Yet again this compendium also follows a similar position to that of the compendium of Hummaam ibn Munabbeh and it must have been compiled at 65H or at least before. Where is that the ignorant claim of 250H and where is 65H. If only they were honest to themselves and freed themselves from arrogance to see the truth.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE BOOK OF AMR IBN HAZM (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</span></strong><br /><br />He was the governor of Yemen and the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) sent him a small booklet of the rulings and guidance which Amr bin Hazm used for the people of Yemen. Later Amr bin Hazm added approximately 21 more prophetic commands. This small booklet was perserved and cited by Ibn Toolaan in his ‘A’laam as-Saa’eeleen Aan Kutub Sayyud al-Mursaleen’.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">THE COMPILATION OF ANAS IBN MAALIK (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)</span></strong><br /><br />Anas ibn Maalik (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) used to also have a compendium that he compiled and when his students would ask him he would present his compilation. He would say. “These are the ahadeeth which are heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) and then i showed them to the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam).” (al-Mustadrak (3/573-574)<br /><br />so and so forth with regards to the various different compendiums and compilations of hadeeth that were collated by the various companions and succesors all before 250H<br /><br />like the Book of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah [71H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) which had approximately 1000 ahadeeth. Refer to Tadhkirratul-Huffaadh (1/43)<br /><br />like the book of Samurah bin Jundub [60H] (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) refer to Tadheeb ut-Tahdheeb (4/236).<br /><br />and the list can continue.<br /><br />we advise the readers to refer to the ebook section on this blog to read the late sub continent hadeeth master, Abdul Ghaffar Hassans book titled The compilation of Hadeeth for further reading.<br /><br />lastly we would like our dear readers to email MECO (Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford) at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:info@meco.org.uk">info@meco.org.uk</a><!-- e --> and let them know we will not stand for poor backward thinking, philosophy, feeble intelects and deviated misguided teachings to enter Islam as we have a history of 1400 years of pure pristine Islamic teachings. Further if you at MECO have difficulty controlling your anti women jihad and takfeer or from degrading our Muslim Women (May Allaah raise their rank Ameen), then at least some respect for your own women folk.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">FEAR ALLAAH.</span></strong><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/a-refutation-of-the-deviant-named-taj-hargey-the-compilation-of-hadeeth-ar-radd-alal-ilhaadee-al-musammah-bih-taj-hargey/">http://www.salafiri.com/a-refutation-of ... aj-hargey/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Jan 25, 2017 9:15 pm</p><hr />
