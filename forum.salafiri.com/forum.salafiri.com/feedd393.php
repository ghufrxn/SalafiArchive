<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br />How many types of meanings are there for the Most Perfect Names by way of implication?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br />They are of four types:<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The First:</span></strong> The Proper Name which includes and implies all the meanings of the Most Perfect Names, and it is Allaah. And due to this all the Names are mentioned as attributes of the Name Allaah, such as His, the Most High’s, saying, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“He is Allaah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms.”</span></strong> (al-Hashr: 24) etc. And the Name Allaah is never mentioned after other Names.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Second:</span></strong> That which includes and implies an Attribute of the Essence of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Such as His, the Most High’s, Name ‘as-Samee’ (the All-Hearing) which implies His extensive hearing, encompassing all sounds whether secret or open. And His Name ‘al-Baseer’ (the All-Seeing) which implies His penetrating sight, encompassing all visible objects small or big. And His Name ‘al-‘Aleem’ (the All-Knowing) which implies His all encompassing knowledge which, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Not even the weight of an atom (or a small ant) or less than that or greater escapes His Knowledge in the heavens or in the earth.”</span></strong> (Saba’: 3). And His Name ‘al-Qadeer’ (the All-Powerful, All-Able) which implies His power and ability over all things, to bring into existence or to annihilate whatever He wills.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Third:</span></strong> That which includes and implies an Attribute of action for Allaah, such as ‘al-Khaaliq’ (the Creator), ‘ar-Raaziq’ (the Provider), ‘al-Baaree’ (the Originator), and ‘al-Musawwir’ (the Supreme Fashioner) and other than that.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Fourth:</span></strong> That which includes and implies removal of all blemishes and defects for Allaah, the Most High, and glorifying Him from all imperfections, such as ‘al-Qudoos’ (the Revered) and ‘as-Salaam’ (the Bestower of Peace).<br /><br /><strong>al-Haafidh al-Hakamee</strong><br /><br />A’laam as-Sunnah al-Manshoorah li I’tiqaad at-Taaifah an-Naajiyah al-Mansoorah<br /><br />Translated by Abul-Irbaad Abid Zargar<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=517">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=517</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2017 10:39 pm</p><hr />
