Shaykh Al-Albânî </em>grades its chain of narration hasan in Sahîh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad p444, and notes, “In this narration this illustrious Companion indicates that it is permissible to supplicate for someone to have a long life, even if he is an unbeliever, and so [this can be done for] a Muslim a fortiori…However, the supplicant should make sure that the unbeliever is not an enemy of the Muslims. It is also taken from this [narration] that such an unbeliever can be commiserated with what has been mentioned therein [i.e. the believers are the ones who will receive the mercy of Allâh and His blessings].”<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/supplicating-for-an-unbeliever/">https://www.sayingsofthesalaf.net/suppl ... nbeliever/</a><!-- m --></div>
