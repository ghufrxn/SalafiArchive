Don’t you fear of this responsibility? Don’t you fear that (how) you end up (in your old age) depends on how you have raised your children? When you don’t discipline them, they will grow up being disobedient to you – a fitting recompense! The one who does not fulfill the rights of Allaah in the proper upbringing of his children, it may soon happen that they will not fulfill the rights of Allaah regarding him when he grows old and dies.”<br /><br />Taken from the Shaykh's website: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ibnothaimeen.com/">http://www.ibnothaimeen.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Translation Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://foodiefahoodie.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/how-your-kids-treat-you-in-your-old-age.html?m=1">http://foodiefahoodie.blogspot.co.uk/20 ... e.html?m=1</a><!-- m --></div>
