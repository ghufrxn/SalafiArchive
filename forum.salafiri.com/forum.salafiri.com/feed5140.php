<subtitle>Expounding the way of the Salaf us-Saleh in implementing the Quran and Sunnah. Indeed they (Ahl al-Hadith) acted upon the hadith whilst opposing blind following - the true madhab free from opinions and partisanship, which the companions taught the people</subtitle>

Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) stated in Majmū’ al-Fataāwā, vol.3, pg.156:<br /><br />“As  for  pretending  to  be  upon  the  Madhhab  of   the Salaf then this is bātil, as this is not possible except that ignorance will increase and knowledge will decrease.”<br /><br />We don’t wish to overly comment upon the Imaams above quote but suffice it to say that it seems the watering down and wolves clothed in Salafiyyah garments is not a modern problem but one which has been dealt with by our salaf. Instead, we record below the words of  a current day scholar.<br /><br />Shaikh  Abdus  Salām  bin  Sālim  Rajā’  as-Suhaymī  (Associate Professor  in  the  Department  of  Fiqh,  College  of  Sharī’ah,  Islamic University of Madeenah) Commented on the above quote with, “I say: “During our time there have been those who have claimed to be upon the madhab of  the Salaf when the reality is that they are not. Indeed, there are those who are part of modern partisan groups, some who have the ideology of the Khawārij in the name of  Salafiyyah and the likes. All of  this is the result of  the increase of  ignorance and the decrease of knowledge just as Shaykh ul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah stated, or there has been a watering down of the Salafee Manhaj in order to include deviated groups in the guise of Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā’ah”. (Please refer to the tremendous book of the sheikh ‘Kun Salafiyyan ’alā’l-Jādah’ pg.72)<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not-differ-la-tafarraqu/">http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not- ... tafarraqu/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Moin</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 12:56 am</p><hr />
