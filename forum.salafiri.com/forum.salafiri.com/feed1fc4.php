<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF8000">بسم الله والحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله ، وبعد</span></span></strong><br /><br />* When the Muslim hears a Command from Allaah and His Messenger <strong>صلى الله عليه وسلم</strong>, then he should carry it out without hesitation to the best of his ability.<br /><br />* When the Muslim hears about a prohibition, then he should shun it without having any second thoughts.<br /><br />* Don’t wait asking if it is Waajib or Mustahab or if it is Makrooh or Haraam.<br /><br /><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaleh al-`Uthaimeen رحمه الله said:</strong><br /><br />“Second point: Obeying his <strong>صلى الله عليه وسلم</strong> command and not hesitating in carrying it out due to the saying of Allaah <strong>تعالى</strong>:<br /><br /><span style="color: #408040">{It is not for a Believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.}</span> [Surah al-Ahzaab (33): 36]<br /><br />That is why I say: That which is an error is that some people whenever a command comes to him from Allaah and His Messenger, he begins to inquire about it. So he says: “Is this command Waajib (obligatory) or is it Mustahab (recommended)?” as many people say today. This is a question which must be thrown out and not asked because the Sahaabah (Companions of the Messenger) <strong>رضي الله عنهم</strong> whenever the Prophet <strong>صلى الله عليه </strong><strong>وسلم</strong> commanded them with something, they never said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Is this command Waajib or is it Mustahab or other than that?” Rather they acted and had conviction without even asking.<br /><br />Thus we say: Do not question. Rather upon you is to act. If you bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then do that which he has commanded you to do.<br /><br />However in a situation where a person has fallen into an issue and an act of disobedience, then in this case he has the right to ask: “Is this obligatory or non-obligatory?” That's because if it was obligatory then he must repent from it because he has disobeyed. And if it was not obligatory then his affair is easy.”<br /><br /><strong>[Explanation of 40 Hadeeth of al-Nawawee, Hadeeth #2]</strong><br /><br />Source: <a href="http://ilm4all.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/the-muslims-attitude.html?m=1" class="postlink">http://ilm4all.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/the-muslims-attitude.html?m=1</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 11:29 pm</p><hr />
