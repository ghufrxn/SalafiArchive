				<h3>The Aqidah Of The Rafidhah Shi’ah Concerning the Companions</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Aug 24, 2016 11:03 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shi’ah Papers Part 2 -The Aqidah Of The Rafidhah Shi’ah Concerning the Companions, Abu Bakr, Umar &amp; Uthmaan from the Children of Hasan and Hussain (RadhiAllahu Anhuma)</span></strong><br /><br />Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />The shee’ah declare the all the companions to be disbelievers including the household members of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) except 3 companions. Infact the Shee’ah Raafidhah twist this and say all the companions apostated after the demise of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam). Furthermore Shee’ah Raafidhah believe it is permissible and they encourage the cursing and abusing of the companions and this has continued from the very beginning.<br /><br />In this day and age when Ahlus Sunnah Wal-Jama’ah have expounded and virtue and love of the companions overwhelmingly the Shee’ah Raafidhah have had no choice to manifest their deceptive behaviour and once again change their stance and approach. Now they say they were not disbelievers but inferior in virtue to Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and hence he had superiority over all companions and should have been the First Caliph.<br /><br />Irrespective of what the Shee’ah Raafidhah say in this day and age it does not hold any value nor will their statements substantiate their beliefs due to them concealing their faith and lying, namely taqiyyah and kithman. Therefore in order to ascertain the beliefs of the Shee’ah Raafidhah it is important to consult and refer to their classical and unilateral works.<br /><br />Kulainee reports from Ja’afar who said, <br /><br />“After the demise of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) everyone apostated except 3 people and he said they were Miqdaad bin al-Aswad, Abu Dharr al-Ghiffaree and Salmaan al-Faarisee.” (Furoo al-Kaafee 69/137-138 of Kulainee)<br /><br />Majlisee reports, <br /><br />“A servant of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said to him, “I have served you well for a long time, please tell me about Abu Bakr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)? So he replied, “Both of them were Kaafirs (disbelievers) and whoever loves them is also a Kaafir (disbeliever).” (Bahaar al-Anwaar pg.522 of Majlisee)<br /><br />Concerning the verse which mentions <br /><br />“Wa Yanha Anil Fahshaa Wal Munkar Wal-Baghya…” al-Qummee said in his explanation of the Quraan, “Fahshaa refers to Abu Bakr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Munkar refers to Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and baghya refers to Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).” (Tafseer al-Qummee pg.218)<br /><br />Majlisee further said, <br /><br />“There are numerous and plenty of ahadeeth which allude to the kufr (disbelief) of Abu Bakr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), they also allude to the innovations they formulated. They also allude to acquiring reward for cursing and abusing them and for also disassociating and shunning them. These ahadeeth number so many that they can be compiled into one or many volumes.” (Bahaar al-Anwaar pg.330)<br /><br />Majlisee says after citing a report that <br /><br />“Abu Bakr (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) will be in the depths of the hell fire.” (Bahaar al-Anwaar pg.334)<br /><br />The Shee’ah Raafidhah author says,<br /><br />“Oh Allaah have mercy and shower your blessings upon Muhammad (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) and his Family and curse both (ie Abu Bakr and Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) the tyrannical idolaters and curse both of his daughters (ie Aishah and Hafsah (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) except the Quraish.” (Ahqaaq al-Haqq 1/337)<br /><br />Majlisee said in another work, <br /><br />“In the religion of Imaamiyyah (ie the Shee’ah Raafidhah who reject the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) and adopt The Imamate of Alee and the Imaams) the aspects which are considered to be necessary to believe in are Mut’a (temporary marriage) being halaal (ie lawful) and rejecting and shunning 3 people (ie Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) similarly the same applies to Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and Yazeed ibn Mu’awiyyah (Rahimahullah) and from every individual who fought against the leader of the believers (ie Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).” (Risaalah al-Ei’tiqaad pg.58 of Majlisee)<br /><br />The Shee’ah Raafidhah on the day of Ashoora bring a dog which they call umar and they vehemently hit the dog with sticks and stones, until it dies. Then they bring a little goat which they name aishah and they pull its hair right out from the roots and hit it with their shoes and slippers until it also dies. (ASTAGFIRULLAHUl-A’DHEEM) (Tabdeed adh-Dhulaam Wa Tanbiyyah an-Niyaam pg.32)<br /><br />Similarly they celebrate a day of festivities and feasts on the day Umar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) was martyred and they give an honorary title to the cowardly assassin Abu Lulu al-Majoosee, as Baba Shuja ud deen (The Bold and Brave Saint of the Deen) (al-Kunaa Wa al-Qaab 2/55 of Abbaas al-Ajamee)<br /><br />The simple question we have if the Shee’ah Raafidhah believe Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) apostated, they were hypocrites and innovators (may the curse of Allaah be upon the liars) then why did Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and his the household name their children Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma)?<br /><br />This clearly shows the Shee’ah Raafidhah are liars and they lie and the normal shee’ah masses get engulfed and subjugated with such beliefs without realising the true reality of such issues. Be brave and leave these foolish concepts and know that one day you will die and face Allaah, do not think about what your family and friends will think if you abandon such beliefs and the shee’ah religion rather think what will happen on the day of judgement when Abu Bakr as-Siddeeque, Umar bin al-Khattaab, Uthmaan ibn Affaan and Alee bin Abee Taalib and all of the companions (May Allaah be pleased with all of them) are standing with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) and your asked why were you cursing and abusing my companions?<br /><br />We further ask the Shee’ah Raafidhah since when have they starting naming their children with names that belong to non muslims (according to their incorrect beliefs) its hypocritical and disillusional. It is like the Shee’ah Raafidhah saying we will name our boys as salman rushdie, barack obama, george bush or tony blair or name our women as hirsi ali or amina wudud it does not make sense.<br /><br />So claiming love for the household of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) and at the same time cursing their children and offspring is indeed a great crime and a hidden agenda of the Shee’ah Raafidhah in belittling the companions and the Prophets household. This is clear proof against the Shee’ah Raafidhah who curse Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan (RadhiAllaahu Anhuma) whereas the household of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alayhee Wasallam) named their children with the same names, this warrants an answer from the Shee’ah Raafidhah<br /><br />The following children of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) ibn Abee Taalib were martyred (May Allaah be pleased with them all)<br /><br />Hussain, Ja’afar, Abbaas, Abu Bakr!!!, Muhammad, Uthmaan!!!<br /><br />The following children of Hussain ibn Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) were martyred<br /><br />Alee Akbar (some reports his name was Umar), Abdullaah<br /><br />The Following children of Hasan ibn Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) were martyred<br /><br />Abdullaah, Qaasim, Abu Bakr!!!<br /><br />The Following children of Aqeel (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) ibn Abe Taalib were martyred<br /><br />Ja’afar, Abdullaah, Abdur Rahmaan, Muslim, Abdullaah ibn Muslim<br /><br />The Following children of Abdullaah ibn Ja’afar (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) ibn Abe Taalib were martyred<br /><br />A’un, Muhammad Ridhwaan (May Allaah be pleased with all of them)            <br /><br />(refer to Taareekh Khaleefah pg.224 of Ibn Khayaat)<br /><br />Dear readers note why did the household of Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) name their children Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthmaan, it is a point worth noting. This also shows clear enmity and animosity<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/the-shiah-papers-part-2-the-aqidah-of-the-rafidhah-shiah-concerning-the-companions-abu-bakr-umar-uthmaan-from-the-children-of-hasan-and-hussain-radhiallahu-anhuma/">http://www.salafiri.com/the-shiah-paper ... hu-anhuma/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.</div>
