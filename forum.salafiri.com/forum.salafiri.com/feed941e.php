<title type="html"><![CDATA[The Ruling of Criticising and Praising in this Era]]></title>

<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh was asked: 'The questioner says; Has the sunnah of Criticising and Praising died? And what is the ruling of refutation against the one who opposes (the truth) regardless of his individual status?</span></strong><br /><br />He replied: I fear that this could be a word of truth, by which some falsehood is intended by. Criticising and Praising has not died, it has not been laid to rest and has not reached sickness, and for Allaah is all praise, it is (still) established. Criticising and Praising may be in the witnesses present with the judge, they may disparage the defendant, and an explanation will be sought from him. It may also take place in narrations. And we have indeed heard from the recitation of our imaam, the statement of Allaah Ta'aalaa: Oh you who believe, if a transgressor comes to you with some information, then verify it [2].<br /><br />So Criticising and Praising will remain present as long as the genus of man remains, so for as long as humans remain, then Criticising and Praising will remain. However I fear that a person may say &quot;so and so is a criticised one&quot;, whilst in fact he is not a criticised one. And he will take this ruling as a means of spreading the faults of the created beings.<br /><br />So for this reason, I say, if there is any given fault in a person, then if some greater benefit, need, or requirement warrants explaining it, then there is no  problem with this, there is no issue with clarifying it – However the best thing would be to say &quot;some people say such and such, some people do such and such&quot; and so on, for two reasons: [1]. That he remains safe from the issue of specifying individuals [2].<br /><br />That the ruling will then include both him and others if not, and we in fact see a specific individual who the people have become affected by, and he calls<br />towards innovation or misguidance – then it is actually necessary to specify, so that the people are not deceived by him.<br /><br /><strong>by Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-Uthaymeen</strong><br /><br />[The audio can be found here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SS5PQqHIg" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SS5PQqHIg</a>]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes</span></strong><br /><br />1.
