Born in the year 203 AH, and died in the year 266 AH.<br /><br />[3] The Jimaar consists of three sites which are stoned during the rituals of Hajj. The first being Jamrah al-Kubra, which is the closest to al-Khayf, the second site is known as Jamrah al-Wusta and the third site is known as Jamrah al-Aqabah which it is the last of the Jimaar and the closest one to Makkah.<br /><br />[4] The days of Tashreeq are three, 11th 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah after the day of an-Nahr, 10th of Dhul-Hijjah. These days are known as Tashreeq because in the past the pilgrims and others would sacrifice animals during these days.<br /><br />[5] The sun’s zenith at midday.<br /><br />[6] Stoning on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah is to be done after the pilgrim has left Muzdalifah and upon arrival at Minaa, after sunrise until the evening</div>
