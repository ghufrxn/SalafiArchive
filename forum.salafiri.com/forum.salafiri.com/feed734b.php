<strong><em>&quot;What is written for the one who prays forty days in Jama’ah&quot;</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Question</strong> : He صلى الله عليه وسلم said, Whoever safeguards the salat for forty days, it is written for him Baraa’tan ( he is declared free from two things); he’s declared free from the fire, and free from hypocrisy, or as he صلى الله عليه وسلم said?<br /><br /><strong>Answered by Shaykh Rabee’ حفظه الله</strong> :<br /><br />The hadith is on the authority of Anas bin Maalik رضي الله عنه he said that the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم said, “Whoever prays to Allah forty days in congregation, wherein he catches the first Takbeer, it is written for him Baraa’tan, (he is declared free from two things); he’s declared free from the fire, and free from hypocrisy.”<br /><br />We ask Allah to allow all of us to achieve that. And this affair is something which is difficult, it requires striving against ones self, and serious diligence. This will not be easy for us except if we are early for every prayer. The athan isn’t called except that a person is around the masjid or in it. (When that is done) then this will be easy for him Insha Allah, therefore be diligent upon this good.<br /><br />Note: this hadith is Collected by At-Tirmidhee and was graded Hasan by Shaykh Al-Albani رحمه الله by gathering all of it’s chains.<br /><br />Taken from : <a href="http://www.rabee.net/" class="postlink">http://www.rabee.net/</a><br /><br />Translator : Abdur-Rahmaan Ihsaan<br /><br /><a href="http://loveforthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/what-is-written-for-the-one-who-prays-forty-days-in-jamaah/" class="postlink">http://loveforthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/what-is-written-for-the-one-who-prays-forty-days-in-jamaah/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Sep 09, 2016 2:19 am</p><hr />
