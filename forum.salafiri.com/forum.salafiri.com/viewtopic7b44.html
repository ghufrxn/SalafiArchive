				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ibn al-Qayyim said, discussing the parentâ€™s responsibilities in raising the child in Tuhfat al-Mawdood (241):</span></strong><br /><br />He should avoid letting him became lazy and inactive, and should teach him the opposite. He should not let him rest for more than he needs to refresh his body and soul for more work, for laziness and inactivity bring bad consequences and will end in regret, but hard work brings good consequences, either in this world or in the Hereafter or in both.</div>
