				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">‘Allaamah Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee was asked:</span></strong><br /><br />A woman owns gold which reaches the minimum required amount for zakaah; is it permissible for her to pay her zakaah to her (Muslim) sisters or to her husband, bearing in mind that she does not own anything except this gold?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong><br /><br />Yes, it is permissible for her to pay her zakaah to her sisters if they are poor. Poorness is neediness; meaning that one does not have that which suffices him. It is also permissible for her to pay her zakaah to her husband if he is poor; as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, when she said:<br /><br />“Is it permissible for me to give zakaah of my gold to him (my husband).”<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />“Yes.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://muqbel.net/fatwa.php?fatwa_id=1645">http://muqbel.net/fatwa.php?fatwa_id=1645</a><!-- m --></div>
