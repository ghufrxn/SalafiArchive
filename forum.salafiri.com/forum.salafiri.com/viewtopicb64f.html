It is well-known by way of legislative proofs from the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that actions and statements are only accepted if they are performed by a person with sound creed. If a person’s creed is not sound, that which emanates from him from statements and actions will be rendered vein.<br /><br />Allah, The Most High, says: “And whoever denies the faith – his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.”  [Soorah al-Maa’idah (5): 5]<br /><br />And He, The Most High, says: “And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” [Soorah az-Zumar (39): 65] – And there are many ayaat that carry this meaning.
