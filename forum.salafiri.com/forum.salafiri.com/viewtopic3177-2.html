				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><strong>صريح السنة</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><strong>Sareeh as-Sunnah</strong></span><br /><br />By Imaam of the Mufassireen, al-Haafidh, al-Faqeeh, Al-Allaamah Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Jareer at-Tabaree [d. 310 AH] [May Allaah have Mercy on him]<br /><br />لابن جرير الطبري [May Allaah have Mercy on him]<br /><br />Explained by The Noble Scholar Sa'd bin Naasir as-Shithree [May Allaah Preserve him]<br /><br />All Praise is due for Allaah and May the Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon the most noblest of Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family, his companions collectively.<br /><br /><strong><em>To proceed:<br />Introduction of Shaykh Sa'd ash-Shithree</em></strong><br /><br />From the things that make the Salaf noble is the fact that they all shared the same belief, and likewise we share the same beliefs as them. There are no differences in what we believe and what we believe, nothing has changed over the years because we, like them, have stuck to the teachings from the Quraan and Sunnah, therefore its teachings being universal despite of time or place.<br /><br />If we study the book Usool as-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad or Sareeh as-Sunnah of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree or 'Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah of Imaam at-Tahaawee or the book of Ibn Zayd al-Qayrawaanee, we will find that the they didn’t differ. Yes, they had different Madhabs so they differed in their Fiqh, however in their 'Aqeedah, they were united and one.<br /><br />Then you had scholars that came after them like Ibn Taymiyyah who wrote al-Waasitiyyah and then you have the likes of Ibn al-Qayyim, Imaam adh-Dhahabee, Ibn Qudaamah and in our times we have the like of Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Ibn 'Uthaymeen and many other scholars like them; all of them with one 'Aqeedah, there is no differing between them on this despite them coming in various different times and ages.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Brief Biography of the Author</span><br /><br />This book was written by Imaam Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Jareer at-Tabaree, he died 310 AH and he has authored many books. From them is his famous Tafseer al-Kabeer, which is a major book that people haven’t stopped benefitting from up until today. He also authored the book of Taareekh Umam wa al-Mulook which is a book of biographies and history, Tahtheeb al-Athaar which is a book of Hadeeth and he goes through the rulings connected to the Ahaadeeth, and there are various other books he has wrote, the point is he is a well revered Imaam of Ahl as-Sunnah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">Introduction of the Author</span><br /><br />بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br /><br />All Praise are due for Allaah, The One who Made the truth spread and Supported it, the One who Destroyed falsehood and caused it to fade away. The One Who Chose Islaam for it to be His Religion, the One Who Ordered us with it and enveloped it around our lives, we rely on Him to Protect us as He Guaranteed that our religion will prevail, even if the Mushrikeen detest it.<br /><br />Then He Chose a Messenger from His Creation, he was sent to call them and command them to be upright and steadfast with what he came with. We are ordered to be patient with the ignorance of the people and the tests that they may bring; even if you are tested with them gathering against you or physically beating you. We should uphold good manners with them without humiliating ourselves, we should respect them without being defeated.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0040FF">The Command to be Patient on the Truth</span><br /><br />The author begins the book with Praising Allaah [The Glorified and Exalted], this is because Allaah has favoured us with many favours. From these favours is the fact that he has made the truth clear and strong and it can't coexist with falsehood, in fact it destroys falsehood and He has made falsehood weak, it can't be compared to the truth. However, the problem we face is that some people may not be able to understand the truth and distinguish it falsehood, perhaps the truth hasn’t reached some people. Therefore, in certain times the truth may be unclear, however the fact remains that the truth will always be present and it will always nullify falsehood.<br /><br />Also from the favours of Allaah [The Glorified and Exalted] is that He has protected the religion until the Last Day, this is from the favours of Allaah [The Glorified and Exalted]. No matter how the enemies, Iblees and his allies, try to destroy the religion and distract the people from the truth, Allaah [The Glorified and Exalted] has Promised to protect it and He will protect people from going astray until the Hour is established.<br /><br />Also from the favours of Allaah [The Glorified and Exalted] is the fact that He has chosen men in every time, from the time of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] until the Companions [May Allaah be Pleased with them all] and the scholars that came after that them and that they will remain until the Hour is established. There will always be scholars in every generation, so it is impossible for a generation to come without there being scholars, as the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said;<br /><br />“There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah that are victorious and steadfast upon the truth, those who abandon them will not be able to harm them, they will remain until the Hour is established.” [Narrated by Saheeh Muslim (6/52-53)]<br /><br />These scholars are those who have made it easy for the people to learn and understand, they have guided people to the truth, and they have explained the religion of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. They are known to bring benefit for the people in their worldly and religious affairs as they are the ones who have ability to bring about rectification. They are the reason why goodness comes to the people. Because of their position and status, people try to annoy them. They are the forbearers of doing good however the creation respond to them with bad. This is what happened to Prophets [Peace be Upon them all], so the scholars are from the best of people. They wait for the reward from Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] and they don’t want anything from the creation, they don’t want money or praise, but they want the pleasure and reward of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. Therefore, they are subjected to trials, tribulations, people annoying them and trying to harm them, yet they remain focused on reward from Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted].<br /><br />Listen to what Allah [The Glorified and The Exalted] advises the people who are in authority, meaning the scholars<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Therefore be patient (O Muhammad) as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers)….&quot;<br />[Ahqaaf 46:35]</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, &quot;When (will come) the Help of Allah?&quot; Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near! <br />[Baqarah 2:214]</span><br /><br />Likewise, if we study the Seerah of The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him], whilst in Makkah he faced many acts of violence against him. There wasn’t a form torture except that they used it, they fought him, they beat him, pelted him with stones, they swore at him, they boycotted him and they even tried to kill him. They wouldn’t set a dialogue with him, they cancelled all trade and transactions with him and by extension they put the Muslims in the most difficult place and this is the description of the majority of the time of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] whilst he was in Makkah.<br /><br />Whilst he was in Madeenah the battle of Ahzaab occurred. Look at the Ayaat describing the situation of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] and the believers;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;O you who believe! Remember Allah's Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels during the battle of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates)]. And Allah is Ever All-Seer of what you do.<br /><br />10. When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats, and you were harbouring doubts about Allah.&quot;</span><br /><br />The Quraysh were facing the Muslims from in front of them, meaning from the direction of Makkah and the tribe of Ghatafaan and Banu Quraythah were from below them, meaning behind them.<br /><br />Whilst surrounded, some started worrying about their situation and others harboured doubts Islaam. They were in a extremely difficult situation, they were being starved, the severity of winter was bitterly cold, the enemies had surrounded them so fear had spread and on top of this they thought Islaam was about to be finished.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.<br /><br />And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubts) said: &quot;Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusions!&quot;&quot;<br />[Ahzaab 33: 9-12]</span><br /><br />Referring to the Munaafiqeen from the Muslim camp; they doubted the promise of Allah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. They questioned; how can we be saved in this situation? We are starved, we are surrounded, we are freezing etc. However, the believers remained firm and they affirmed belief in Islaam and that help would come, thus they say the promise come true.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And when the believers saw Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), they said: &quot;This is what Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) had spoken the truth, and it only added to their faith and to their submissiveness (to Allah).&quot;[Ahzaab 33:22]</span><br /><br />This used to be the condition of the non-Muslims, they would try to starve the Muslims and create problems however the scholars and the people of Islaam have been ordered to remain patient.<br /><br />A person may say, 'Why did the Prophets get tested? Why do the scholars get tested? Those Companions [May Allaah be Pleased with them all] were strong on their religion so why were they tested? Why wasn’t the religion and their worldly affairs made easy for them? Why weren’t they given the riches of the world? Isn’t Allaah the One Who controls the universe so he can give the believers as He Pleases?<br /><br />The answer to these doubts are simple; Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] intends for the ones who stick the religion to be sincere in their intentions to work for the Hereafter, so your hearts will be connected to the real world, the real world of the hereafter, they need to be sincere. Trials and tribulations will come to them in their worldly lives so if their hearts were connected to the worldly life and the riches of the worldly life was opened and made easy for them, then they would become insincere, they would do deeds only for the sake of worldly benefit. If this was the case, all those who become Muslim would do it for worldly benefit because they would receive anything they wished from the worldly life. So if people come into the religion and he believes in the Hereafter, then he will work towards it and not for the sake of the worldly life. He will know that there will be problems in his worldly life and not everything will be made easy, however he will be encouraged to be patient upon these trials and tests.<br /><br />Therefore, being tested makes on sincere as he intends for the reward from Allaah and the pleasure of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. When the person's intent is to seek the pleasure of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] he doesn’t care about the worldly life. He doesn’t concern himself with whether he gets wealth from the worldly or not. Rather, he tries to gain the highest place in Jannah, working for the Hereafter.<br /><br />The second thing answer to these doubts is that if the religion of Islaam called people to the worldly life then the people would enter the religion for the sake of the worldly life, as soon as any difficulty or trials afflict them, they would leave. Those who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, then they strive for the Hereafter because this is their objective, so if they are tested in the world then they will be patient on the trials and tribulations they are afflicted with.<br /><br />A third way to answer these doubts; Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] intends for us to be expiated, if we have any defaults even though Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has given us many favours, we are unable to thank him properly. So by the means of trials and tribulations we are able to raise our status by having patient. He [The Glorified and The Exalted] raises us by our patience by rewarding us and giving us a high status in the Hereafter. Therefore, trials and tribulations help purify and rectify our affairs as it expiates our mistakes.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;when a catastrophe befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth&quot;<br />[Nisaa 4:62]<br /></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself&quot;<br />[Nisaa 4:79]</span><br /><br />Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has promised the believers that their end result will be good. No matters what evil befalls you in the worldly life, Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] will replace it with something better in the Hereafter. If you don't receive something that you asked for, such as you didn’t get money or a high position or anything else you may desire, Allaah[The Glorified and The Exalted] promises that he will replace it with something better. So He has given you faith and certainty, He has assisted you in your affairs and He made you established and upright on the religion. If He Blessed you with so much, then it is even more conceivable that He will replace the worldly life for you in the Hereafter.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;…and the (blessed) end is for those with Taqwa&quot;<br />[A'raaf 7:128]</span><br /><br />What Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has prepared in the Hereafter is far better and greater than what the people are given in the world. The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, &quot;A whip of one of you in the Jannah is better than the world and all it contains.&quot; [Musannaf Ibn Abee Shaybah (33332)] Therefore, something so small and trivial that the people of Jannah are given will be fifty times greater than what the most honourable and wealthiest King of the world is given.<br /><br />Therefore, make yourself prepared to be tried and be patient when it comes. The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, &quot;The most tested of the people are the Prophets then those who are like them and those who are like them.&quot; [At-Tirmidhee (2398)]<br /><br />Imaam at-Tabaree spoke upon the scholars of the Shari'ah, they are the ones who have knowledge. So what are their characteristics? They are firm in their religion and knowledge, they don’t memorise statements or author books except that they know the rulings of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] in the issues they are discussing. They are able to get the correct opinion give Fataawa and teach the people, distinguishing from truth and false statements.<br /><br />The second characteristic of the scholars is that they are able to draw a balance between the wants and desires of the people and what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has commanded. Based on this, they don’t disseminate knowledge according to desires and the wants of the people, rather they give importance to what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] wants and has commanded, therefore he is sincere in giving the people what is good for them and bringing about betterment for them.<br /><br />The scholars are those who don’t follow their desires, they are those who are firm in following the Kitaab and the Sunnah and they want this for the people too.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah's Path.&quot;<br />[An'aam 6:116]</span><br /><br />The scholars are those who when they speak, they speak only to Please Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. They know what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] wants and has orders. They don’t seek to please the rulers and the kingsbut they seek to fulfill the commandments of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] alone. They don’t give importance to rules and regulations that comes from the opinions and desries of man, rather they give importance to what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has commanded. Even if the people were against them and speak about them and the rulers were against them and even if close family members were against them, they would still be focused on attaining the Pleasure of Allaah. Pleasing Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] is their objective and not giving the pleasure of the creation precedence over that.<br /><br />Another characteristic is that they have the best of conduct and manners. They deal with the people in the best of ways and with the best of manners. They behave and act in the best of conduct and they are not mannered with those who are good to them alone, rather they are mannered with all people even those who don’t like them and are against them.<br /><br />From their characteristics is that they are responsible for taking the false notions and bad understand out of the minds of the people. They guide the creation to what is better to and they are able to see the end result and predict ahead. Because of their wisdom, they don’t always act on the immediate future or what they see below their feet, rather they have foresight.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;…if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).&quot;<br />[Nisaa 4:83]</span><br /><br />These scholars are a light on earth. Yes, a light on earth because Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has made them lamps for the people. They guide them in depths darkness of trials and tribulation, when people can't tell what is right from wrong and they have no knowledge of what is coming and going, the scholars are the ones who are able to expand and explain the affairs to the people. People are usually overcome with opinions and their intellects are often affected, however the scholars are those who help people to see a right.<br /><br />Therefore they are the best of the people, they are from the best of creation as they guide to the way of truth and they are the only ones who have the truth with them. They more, than anyone, receive harm from people. People always talk about them and they are constantly in the scope of criticism.<br /><br />I ask Allaah to give them the best of reward and that He Multiplies this for them and that He Raises them in world and Hereafter so that people know their status.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Following the Quraan</span></strong><br /><br />The Noble Quraan is the way to success. This is the way for you to gain the Pleasure of your Lord. This is the cause for you to enter Jannah. It is a guide to those who take it as a yardstick and implement it in his actions. Why is this? It says in Surah al-Faatihah;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Guide us to the Straight Way.&quot;<br />[Faatihah 1:6]</span><br /><br />This straight path is the Quraan. The whole of the Qurana is gathered in this one ayah. Also, the first Aayah in Surah al-Baqarah;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;This is the Book (the Qur'an), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqun [the pious and righteous persons who fear Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].&quot;<br />[al-Baqarah 2:2]</span><br /><br /><br /><br />There is no doubt in it. It is guidance to those who have Taqwaa. It protects you from being misguided and helps you reach the truth and goodness, therefore by it you will know the path of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted].<br /><br />This Quraan is the speech of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted], the Lord of the Aalameen, then The One Created you, provides for you, He doesn't stop giving you from His Favours, The One Who Will Gather you and soon you will stand in front of him and He is The One Who Will Account you in front of Him, whether it be something big or small.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And if anyone of the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an)&quot;<br />[Tawbah 9:6]</span><br /><br />So the wording that has been used is the Word of Allaah. This is clear evidence that this book, even if someone is reading it and you can hear that person's recitation, is still from the Speech of the Lord, The One with Honour and Majesty.<br /><br />We affirm that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] talks because the one who talks is better than one who doesn’t talk. Those who try to deny that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] doesn’t speak argue that affirming speech for Allaah is liken and comparing Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] to the creation. However in response we say; in fact by denying speech as an Attribute of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted], you are likening Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] to the creation by likening Him to beings that can't talk and this is much worse. Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] far better than the one who is unable to talkm in fact Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] affirms speech and talking as an Attribute to Himself;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah [the Taurat (Torah)], then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?&quot;<br />[al-Baqarah 2:75]</span><br /><br />And He, the Most High, says;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And Allah said (O mankind!): &quot;Take not ilahain (two gods in worship, etc.).&quot;<br />[an-Nahl 16:51]</span><br /><br />The talking and speech mentioned in the texts are taken in reality and cannot be described as being a metaphor.<br /><br />If you read an Aayah from the Quraan, does this mean you have heard the Word of Allaah or is the recitation from my own voice and my own speech?<br /><br />Lets answer this with an example, if someone who is reciting poetry that has been written by someone, let's say Zayd wrote this poetry, if I recite this poetry, is this poetry from me or from Zayd?<br /><br />The same applies with the Quraan. Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And if anyone of the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Qur'an)&quot;<br />[Tawbah 9:6]</span><br /><br />So if I read the Quraan and you are listening to me then you are listening to the Words of Allaah, you hear it from me but it is still the Words of Allaah.<br /><br />Whatever is written in the Mushaf, is this also the Words of Allaah?<br /><br />The answer; yes it is the Words of Allaah. Okay, I have a Mushaf here and another Mushaf, which one is the Words of Allaah? Say I have a Mushaf in Britain and the Mushaf in Makkah, are they both Words of Allaah? Are there any Words of Allaah that which is different to other Words of Allaah that may be placed elsewhere? Meaning does the Quran differ? I have memorized a Surah from the Quraan by heart, do the Words of Allaah that is in the Mushaf and that which is my heart differ?<br /><br />The answer to all of this is that all of it is the Words of Allaah.<br /><br />Therefore, this is actually and in its reality the Words of Allaah and it's not a metaphor or a nickname or a representation for something else, in its essence and its reality it is the Words of Allaah.<br /><br />So, if you know this is the Word of your Lord, the One Created you so, how can you take the words of the creation and the words and statements of the people and their views and opinions instead of the Word of Allaah, and believe it to be a greater guidance? How can we leave that which will guide us to the complete guidance? Why do we turn away?<br /><br />This speech of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted], so does this Word of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] was only at the time when it was revealed? Was it the Words of Allaah before He Created creation in eternity and that He didn’t speak again? Does it mean that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] speaks when he wishes?<br /><br />Allaah, the Most High, says;<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;He says to it, 'Be!'&quot;<br />[Yaaseen 36:82]</span><br /><br />Look at what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] says to it, when He Wants a thing, He Says to it, 'Be!'<br /><br />Therefore Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] when He Wants to talk, He Talks and it's not that He Spoke once in eternity and he can't talk again.<br /><br />Another question, are the Words of Allaah created?<br /><br />The answer is that the Speech and the Words of Allaah are Attributes from Attributes of Allaah. Therefore, we can't say that His Words are created because the Names and Attributes of Allaah are not created.<br /><br />Many from the pious Salaf held the view that the Quraan are the Words of Allaah, they stated that it began from Him and it will return to Him.<br /><br />So we ask, how did it begin from Him? Meaning He Spoke it in reality, so how will it return to Him? How does the Quraan go back to Allaah?<br /><br />The answer; when the people leave acting on the Quraan then Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] will lift the Quraan and it will return back to Him.<br /><br />So this is a caution for us to leave acting on the Quraan and being preoccupied with other things. The Quraan may be lifted from all people or it may even be lifted from a group of people, it may also be the case that it is lifted from some people and Shaytaan is replaced with it. He may come to beautify his ideas and thoughts in its place and beautify the fact that you are missing it and are deprived without it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Seeing Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]</span></strong><br /><br />It used to be a constant Dua'a of the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah] be Upon him to say;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">وَأَسْأَلُكَ لَذَّةَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى وَجْهِكَ ، وَالشَّوْقَ إِلَى لِقَائِكَ ، فِي غَيْرِ ضَرَّاءَ مُضِرَّةٍ ، وَلَا فِتْنَةٍ مُضِلَّةٍ<br /><br />&quot;Oh Allaah! I ask to feel the pleasure of seeing Your Face, to be eager to meet You, without there being any harm upon me or any cause of tribulation that will misguide me…&quot;<br /><br />[Narrated Musnad Imaam Ahmad (30/265) Nasaai in Sunan (1305); Classified Saheeh by al-Albaanee]</span><br /><br /><br /><br />Concerning the seeing of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] then it is established in Saheeh Muslim (271) that the Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said,<br /><br />&quot;Allaah will allow the People of Jannah to look at His Face and this will be the highest level in Jannah.&quot;<br />A person may ask; what is the benefit of all this?<br /><br />We affirm seeing the Face of Allaah because The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] told us about it so we must believe in it. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says in the Quraan;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and radiant). Looking at their Lord (Allah)&quot;<br />[Qiyaamah 75:22-23]<br /></span><br />Also, when Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] mentions in Surah al-Mutaffifeen that there will be two types of people, those who are Fujjaar [evil-doers] and those who are Abraar [good-doers], when talking about the Fujjaar, He, the Most High, says;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Nay! Surely, they (evil-doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day&quot;<br />[al-Mutaffifeen 83:15]</span><br /><br />Meaning; that the Abraar will not be prevented from seeing Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. Some say that our eyes can't perceive Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted], as He says;<br /><br />&quot;No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all vision&quot;<br />[An'aam 6:103]<br /><br />So how can you say we will see Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]?<br /><br />The answer is that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] doesn’t deny seeing Him in this Aayah but He denies that we are able to perceive him with our eyes. So seeing is to see something in all is aspects, therefore the negation in this Aayah is for perceiving Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] in His totality. So the meaning of the Aayah is that we are not able to perceive everything in its totality but Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] is able to perceive everything from all is aspects, as He is the All-Seeing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Qadr Allaah</span></strong><br /><br />Whilst giving Da'wah, you will hear people saying Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has ordered you to do certain things and prohibited you from certain things. So the person may take this and argue that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has stopped me from disobeying Him, meaning some are compelled to obey and others compelled to disobey.<br /><br />We say Fear Allaah! Don’t make excuses and try to give justification for you to do your Zinaa, saying that Allaah could have stopped you from disobeying you if He Willed. Allaah is Able to Do all things but we are not allowed to use this fact to justify our sins.<br /><br />This is proof that was said to The Prophet by the Mushrikeen of Makkah;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: 'If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).'&quot;<br />[An'aam 6:148]</span><br /><br />So these people say to us; 'Allaah Knows that we will sin and do this Haraam action and He has even Pre-Decreed it, He Willed it, He Wrote it against us in Lawh al-Mahfoodh, He Created our actions, so how can we be stopped from sinning?<br /><br />They ask us this and we say; if I was to hit your face, severely damaging it, would you blame me? You can't blame me. You must blame Allaah, Allaah created this action of me beating you. Why do you blame me for using Qadr as a proof when you sin and you justify it for yourself, but then how can you blame me for using Qadr as a proof? Is it because it is against you?<br /><br />We say; it is correct that Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] created these actions but the creation have their own free will, so we all have choices. We have free will and this free will that you have is in accordance with what Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] Wills. Because of this free will, you have a choice, you have you have acted and done this deed, therefore you will be accounted for it in front of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] on the Day of Judgment.<br /><br />All your actions have two aspects to them;<br /><br /><em>Firstly</em>, they are from your free will and they are from your own actions.<br /><br /><em>Secondly</em>, Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] has Pre-Decreed it and He Created and Allowed you to do it so it isn’t all Allaah alone, rather Allaah created but it's your choice and your actions. It's your action and Allaah's creation; it's not your creation and Allaah's action!<br /><br />These actions and sins are created by Allaah and He allows them to occur but this doesn’t necessitate that Allaah is Pleased with them or Loves them or Wants them to happen. He Creates things and Allows things to happen for a greater good but it doesn’t mean that He Loves or is Pleased with the thing that happens.<br /><br /><br /><br />A person may say: how can you combine two things at once? How can we say that Allaah Willed something and at the same time He Created the action, yet I still have my own free will and I can do what I want?<br /><br />We say; there's no objection and Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] is Able to Do this and this is part of the Qadr of Allaah.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah wills&quot;<br />[Takweer 81:29]</span><br /><br />So this proves that the free will of the creation must be in accordance with the Will of Allaah, for the action to come in to practice, Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] must allow it to happen.<br /><br />Some people may say; how can Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] Create and Will that which he doesn't Love and Want?<br /><br />We say this question is a mistake. You can do something but He may not want you to do it, however may want to do something that you dislike but you intention is the end result.<br /><br />Is there anyone who wants to spend a million pound in one go? But if you need to, such as buying a house or to built, then you will spend it so that you may reap the profits that will come about after spending this one million pounds.<br /><br />For example, let's take Iblees, everyone knows that he is a sworn enemy to humans, he has extreme enmity and there is not a single person except that he has played with him. He is responsible for taking people away from the religion of Allaah but the benefits and fruits of what Ibless are greater than the evil he is doing. For example, many people repent to Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] and repentance is beloved to Him. Likewise if one is being attacked by a Jinn, he turns himself to Allaah and remembers Him so that the pain and affliction can be relieved. Also, it can also be a form of Dawah for the person who is possessed by Shaytaan, they can do Adhkaar and see the effects of it and they will then get closer to Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. Also, the people who do Ruqya on those people who are possessed, they will be rewarded for this affliction as well.<br /><br />Therefore, all these sins that a person may do are from the actions of the slave and the creation of Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. Many benefits can come from them such as repentance, regret in disobeying Allaah, turning to Allaah after neglecting Him, Da'wah to other people, until the end of all the benefits and favours that we may get from one single act that we may think is bad.<br /><br />Many groups have deviated and have gone astray and have made mistakes on this issue of al-Qadr. If you can comprehend the above in such a simple terms then you should thank Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted]. Some people have researched this issue for tens and tens of years and ended up with no benefit, they have ultimately ended up with the wrong 'Aqeedah thus not able to comprehend the issue and remain in a state of misguidance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Companions [May Allaah be Pleased with them all]</span></strong><br /><br />Who are the companions?<br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">&quot;Muhammad (ﷺ) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers).&quot;<br />[Fath 48:29]</span><br /><br />Who are the companions?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And the first to embrace Islam of the Muhajirun (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to theMuhajirun) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&quot;<br />[Tawbah 9:100]</span><br /><br />Who are the companions?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave their Bai'a (pledge) to you (O Muhammad ) under the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakinah(calmness and tranquillity) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory,&quot;<br />[Fath 48:18]</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Who are the companions?</span></strong><br /><br />How is it possible for a person to have bad companions and you yourself are not bad? Is it possible for Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] to let The Prophet have bad companions? If you had bad companions and then you will be criticised yourself. We don’t allow our children to have bad companions. So is it possible for The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] to have evil companions?<br /><br />Then how can you say that The Companions [May Allaah be Pleased with them all] of the Prophet are evil companions? How can we say that they are the enemies of the religion? That they are Jibt and Taghoot (cf. 4:51)? It's not possible to say this. Those who The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] praised and stated will be in Jannah. He said that even if one you were to spend a mountain like Mount Uhud in gold, you won't be like a Mudd of them [Mudd is like two handfuls] and uhud is a major mountain in Madeenah. How big is it? How high is it? 60, 70 meters? How wide is it? 3km?<br /><br />The comparison in measurements between a handful and a huge mountain are not appropriate, yet you will not be like them even if you spent this much!<br /><br />The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, “Do not revile my companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the equivalent of Uhud in gold, it would not amount to a mudd of one of them, or half of that.” [Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3673) and Muslim (2540)]<br /><br />Ask yourself, would any of you be pleased with having evil companions? If not, then how can we say this about the Prophet?<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Belief that Emaan Increases and Decreases</span></strong><br /><br />Emaan goes up and down, it's not static.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;And whenever there comes down a Surah (chapter from the Qur'an), some of them (hypocrites) say: &quot;Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?&quot; As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.&quot;<br />[at-Tawbah 9:124]</span><br /><br />By the same token, if there is a Kaafir but there is a person who has a more severe Kufr than him, then we say that Kufr is of levels;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Verily, those who disbelieved after their Belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief…&quot;<br />[Aal-Imraan 3:90]</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;The postponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief…&quot;<br />[at-Tawbah 9:37]</span><br /><br />This man he doesn’t believe, he don’t pray, he doesn’t do Dhikr, he doesn’t believe in The Prophet but he has manners and he doesn’t oppress anyone, he gives the rights of the people and he is someone you can trust. This man is a Kaafir, but there is someone who is worse than him. A man who doesn’t uphold the rights of the people and he oppresses them, he forbids people from obeying Allaah and prevents them from the Masjid, he cheats people in trade; this is worse Kufr than the other man, so not all of the Kuffar are equal in their level of Kufr.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;…an addition to disbelief …&quot;<br />[at-Tawbah 9:37]</span><br /><br /> This is evidence that actions are included with what we call Eemaan. If Eemaan increases and decreases then this means it has an effect on your deeds. If you do good deeds then your Eemaan will become stronger but if one decreases in the good deeds he used to do, then likewise his Eemaan will decrease.<br /><br />A person may say: but Allaah draws a distinction between believing an doing good deeds in the Quraan, so they must be separate, like in Surah al-'Asr;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;By Al-'Asr (the time). Verily! Man is in loss. Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth (i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma'ruf)which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar)which Allah has forbidden), and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah's Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad, etc.).&quot;<br />[Al-'Asr 103:1-3]</span><br /><br />We say; no, rather they are connected. If we complete the Surah we will come to the correct understanding, Allaah, the Most High, says:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;…and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah's Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad, etc.).&quot;<br />[Al-'Asr 103: 3]</span><br /><br />Isn’t following and upholding the truth a righteous deed? Isn’t instilling patience a righteous deed? Isn't following and upholding the truth and forbearing patience in this Surah connected, which are both part of righteous deeds? Therefore, we say all of them are connected to Eemaan. Righteous deeds are a part of Eemaan and following the truth and inciting patience are examples of this.<br /><br />So the questioner's example is not correct, rather this is something that we can prove wrong from the Arabic language alone. In the Arabic language we will find that sometimes a thing can be mentioned in it's generality and then this may be preceded with specific examples that come after, thus all of them being connected.<br /><br />For example, a person may say, 'I built the Masjid and the pulpit.' The pulpit is part of the Masjid so both are connected.<br /><br />The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, &quot;Faith has seventy-odd branches, the highest of which is sayingLaa ilaaha ill-Allaah (there is go god except Allaah) and the least of which is removing a harmful thing from the road.” [Narrated by al-Bukhaari (9) and Muslim (35)]<br /><br />In this hadeeth we see that that the highest level of Eeman is a statement and the lowest level of Eemaan is an action.<br /><br />The Prophet [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] said, “Faith has seventy-odd branches, and haya’ is one of the branches of faith.” [Narrated by al-Bukhaari (9) and Muslim (37)]<br /><br />This hadeeth shows that the tongue, the limbs and the heart are all connected and are included in what is defined as Eeman.<br /><br />Is it possible for a person to call himself a believer but he doesn’t do any deeds? In the same light, is it possible for one to call himself a believer but he doesn’t say anything or have any belief in his heart but may do righteous deeds, will this be accepted?<br /><br />We say; Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] commanded us to be righteous and kind to the believers but if one murders another and say 'but I am a believer' would we accept this from him?<br /><br />Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] commanded us to do the pillars of Islaam but if someone doesn’t do it, can we say he is a Muslim? Allaah [The Glorified and The Exalted] commands us with the statement of the Shahaadah but if he doesn’t pronounced it can we say he has Eemaan?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Say (O Muhammad ): &quot;Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).&quot; But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.&quot;<br />[Aal-Imraan 3:32]</span><br /><br />If one recites:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful&quot;<br />[Al-Faatihah 1:1]</span><br /><br />Is this my speech? Is this my action of recitation created? Or is it still from the Words of Allaah? Is the Mushaf created? If you say it is created then you have made mistake if you say not created then you have made a mistake.<br /><br />The Mushaf has two aspects; if you say the ink and paper is created then this is correct but the Mushaf and what it is written on it then this is uncreated. So we are not allowed to say the Mushaf is created as it has more than one aspect to it.<br /><br />Likewise the recitation of the Quraan, is my recitation of the Quraan is created? What I am reciting is not created so we can’t say my recitation of the Quraan is created or uncreated as it has two aspects.<br /><br />Thus we can’t say either of these; created or uncreated. Before we say anything we need to differentiate because it is not a straight forward matter because it has two aspects. Therefore, if you say it is created or uncreated then you are making a mistake.<br /><br />For example, if we have a person called ‘Aqeel, is his body called ‘Aqeel or his name ‘Aqeel? This was discussed by scholars but this issue has no benefit however the scholars have talked about it for many years. Is the name of ar-Rahmaan part of Allah or is it a different aspect altogether. There is no benefit in this. But we can say that the name of something can have four aspects;<br /><br />1-    A name can be the literal name of something otherwise known as Wujood ad-Dhaat<br /><br />2-   A name can also be the spoken use of the word, this is called Wujood al-Khaariji<br /><br />3-   A name can also be an image of something in your mind, this is called Wujood ath-Thihin<br /><br />4-   Or the name can refer to something that is written otherwise called Wujood al-Kitaabah.<br /><br />An example of these four can be found in the word, ‘pen’:<br /><br />A pen can sometimes refer to the noun, the physical pen itself. It can sometimes be a word that is pronounced and there is no physical pen present. Sometimes the word pen can refer to a picture in your pen and sometimes the word pen can be referred to the verb of writing.<br /><br />These are all different ways we can name something and they are all completely separate, therefore one word can be used in four very different ways, however going into all of this has no real benefit as it’s all from the theories of those who dwelled into philosophy.<br /><br />This is the end and I ask Allaah to give us from the good of world and the Hereafter, to make us of those who are guided and guide others.<br /><br />May the Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon His Messenger.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/new-book-explanation-of-sareeh-as.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05 ... eh-as.html</a><!-- m --></div>
