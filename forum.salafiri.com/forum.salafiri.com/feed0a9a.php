Amin.<br /><br />Virtues: The majority of the muhadithin and scholars with the correct aqida of truth have declared him to be trustworthy and praised him. He has a lot of virtues, in fact a lot of major scholars have called him with the name Shaikh ul-Islam. For e.g:<br /><br />1. Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah’s (died 728 Hijri) student Hafidh Dhahabi (died 748 Hijri) said about Ibn Taymiyah:<br /><br />“ash-Shaikh al-Imam al-Allamah al-Hafidh an-Naqid (al-Faqih) al-Mujtahid al-Mufasir al-Bari’ Shaikh ul-Islam Ilm uz-Zuhad Nadiratul Asr (aware of being an ascetic and a rare person of this era)….” (Tadhkiratul Hufadh 4/1496. tarjuma (biography) no.1175)<br /><br />And he wrote,<br /><br />“al-Imam al-Alim al-Mufasir al-Faqih al-Mujtahid al-Hafidh al-Muhadith Shaikh ul-Islam Nadiratul Asr, outstanding authorship and excessively intelligent” (In Tarikh ul-Islam of adh-Dhahabi pg.324)<br /><br />He also wrote,<br /><br />“Our Shaikh al-Imam” (Mu’jam ash-Shuyukh 1/56. 40)<br /><br />From this it is known that Hafidh Dhahabi understood him to be an Imam and Shaikh ul-Islam<br /><br />2. Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah’s student Hafidh Ibn Kathir (Died 774 Hijri) wrote:<br /><br />“Shaikh ul-Islam Abul Abas Taqiudin Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah died” (al-Bidiyah wa an-Nihiya 14/141 and died 728 Hijri)<br /><br />3. Shaikh Ilmudin Abu Muhamad al-Qasim Ibn Muhamad Ibn al-Burzali ash-Shafi’i (died 739 Hijri) said in his Tarikh,<br /><br />“ash-Shaikh al-Imam al-Alim al-Ilm al-Allamah al-Faqih al-Hafidh az-Zahid al-Abid al-Mujahid al-Quduwah (a role model) Shaikh ul-Islam” (Al-Bidiyah wa An-Nihiyah 14/141)<br /><br />Also see al-Uqud wa Duriyah pg.246<br /><br />4. Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah’s student Hafidh Abu Abdullah Muhamad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Abdul Hadi al-Maqdisi al-Hanbali (Died 744 Hijri) wrote a book about him called ‘al-Uqud ad-Duriyah Min Manaqib Shaikh ul-Islam Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah’ which is published in 353 pages by Mutba’ah al-Madani Cairo Egypt and is present with us. Alhamdullilah<br /><br />In this book Ibn Abdul Hadi said,<br /><br />“He is ash-Shaikh ul-Imam ar-Rabani, Imam ul-A’imah and Mufti al-Ummah and a sea of knowledge, a master of memorisation and a prince of understanding and words, a unique person of this era and Qari’ ad-Dahr, Shaikh ul-Islam a blessed creature, Allamah of this era, interpreter of the Qur’an, Ilm uz-Zuhad, a worshipper, suppressor of the innovators in the religion and the latest from the mujtahidin” (al-Uqud ad-Duriyah pg.3)<br /><br />5. Hafidh Abul Fath Ibn Sayid an-Nas al-Ya’mari al-Misri (Died 734 Hijri) said whilst mentioning about Hafidh Jamal ud-Din Abul Hajaj al-Mizi that,<br /><br />“And he was my according to Shaikh ul-Imam Shaikh ul-Islam Taqiudin Abil Abas Ahmad…” (Al-Uqud ad-Duriyah pg.9)<br /><br />6. Kamal udin Abul Ma’ali Muhamad Ibn Abil Hasan az-Zamlikani (died 727 Hijri) wrote with his own hands about Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah’s book, “Bayan ad-Dalil Ala Butlan at-Tahlil”, :<br /><br />“ash-Shaikh the leader of Imams al-Alim al-Allamah the one and only master of memorisation az-Zahid, devout, a role model, having complete knowledge, pious in the religion, Shaikh ul-Islam Mufti of the creatures, leader of the scholars, one of the pious virtous imams, helper of the sunnah overpowering of the bid’ah, a proof from Allah on his slaves in his time, refuter of the people of deviation and hatred, a unique hardworking scholar and the latest from the mujtahidin” (al-Uqud ad-Dariya pg.8, ar-Rad al-Wafir of Ibn Nasirudin ad-Dimishqi pg.104, and the words are from it)<br /><br />7. Abu Abdullah Muhamad Ibn as-Safi Uthman Ibn al-Hariri al-Ansari al-Hanafi (Died 728 Hijri) said,<br /><br />“If Ibn Taymiyah isn’t Shaikh ul-Islam then who is?” (ar-Rad al-Wafir of Ibn Nasirudin pg.98, 56)<br /><br />8. Abu Abdullah Muhamad Ibn Muhamad Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Abil Abas Ahmad Ibn Abd ud-Da’im famously known as Ibn Abd ud-Da’im al-Maqdisi as-Salihi (Died 775 Hijri) called Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah Shaikh ul-Islam. See ar-Rad al-Wafir (pg.61)<br /><br />9. Shamsudin Abu Bakr Muhamad Ibn Muhibudin Abi Muhamad Abdullah Ibn al-Muhib Abdullah as-Salihi al-Hanbali famously known as Ibn al-Muhib as-Samit wrote with his hands,<br /><br />“Our Shaikh al-Imam ar-Rabani Shaikh ul-Islam Imam of information, a sea of knowledge and highly intellectual” (ar-Rad al-Wafir pg.91)<br /><br />10. Hafidh Ibn Taymiyah’s famous student Hafidh Ibn al-Qayim al-Jawziya (Died 751 Hijri) said about him,<br /><br />“Shaikh ul-Islam” (I’lam ul-Muwaqi’in volume 2, pg.241 published by Dar al-Jil Beirut)<br /><br />Apart from these 10 statements there are a numerous more praises of Ibn Taymiyah or where he has been called and given the great title of Shaikh ul-Islam. For e.g:<br /><br />Hafidh Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (Died 790 Hijri) said,<br /><br />“al-Imam al-Faqih al-Mujtahid al-Muhadith al-Hafidh al-Mufasir al-Usuli az-Zahid Taqiudin Abul Abas Shaikh ul-Islam, a knower of vast amounts of information” (adh-Dhayl ala Tabaqat al-Hanabilah 2/387, tarjuma (biography) no.395)<br /><br />Ibn al-Amad al-Hanbali said,<br /><br />“Shaikh ul-Islam…al-Hanbali, rather a complete mujtahid” (Shadharat adh-Dhahab 6/81)<br /><br />The author of Tahdhib al-Kamal and Tuhfatul Ashraf Hafidh Abul Hajaj al-Mizi said,<br /><br />“I haven’t seen anyone like him, and he hasn’t seen anyone like himself. I haven’t seen any scholar greater in knowledge of the Qur’an or Sunnah than him. Additionally I haven’t seen anyone follow the Qur’an and Sunnah more than him” (al-Uqud ad-Duriya pg.7 authored by al-Imam Ibn Abdul Hadi the student of Hafidh al-Mizi. TN and of Imam Ibn Taymiyyah)<br /><br />The summary of all these testimonies is that Ibn Taymiyah was from one of the biggest scholars of ahlus sunnah and was a Shaikh ul-Islam.<br /><br />Also Mula Ali Qari wrote:<br /><br />“Whoever has studied the commentary of Manazil as-Sa’irin then it has become clear to him that them both (Hafidh Ibn Taymiyyah and Hafidh Ibn Qayim) are from the major scholars of ahlus sunnah wal jamah and are awliya from this ummah.” (Jam’ul Wasa’il fi Sharh ash-Shama’il volume 1, pg.207)<br /><br />For a more detailed account of his life see the following books:<br /><br />1. Tadhkiratul Hufadh of adh-Dhahabi (4/1496-1498) and his Tarikh ul-Islam (53/223-226)<br /><br />2. Al-Uqud ad-Duriyah of Ibn al-Hadi<br /><br />3. Al-Bidiya wa an-Nihiya of Ibn Kathir<br /><br />4. Al-Qawl al-Jali of Muhamad Ibn Ahmad al-Bukhari<br /><br />5. Al-Kawakib ad-Duriya of Mar’i Ibn Yusuf<br /><br />6. Al-A’lam al-Aliya of Umar Ibn Ali al-Bazar<br /><br />7. Ar-Rad al-Wafar of Ibn Nasirudin and his at-Tibyan of Badi atul Bayan (3/1461-1466)<br /><br />8. Adh-Dhayl ala Tabaqat al-Hanabilah of Ibn Rajab (2/387)<br /><br />9. Fawat al-Wafayat wadhayl Alayha of Muhammad Ibn Shakir al-Kutbi (1/74, tarjuma (biography) no.34)<br /><br />And he said about Ibn Taymiya, “Shaikh ul-Islam”<br /><br />10. Imam Ibn Taymiya, Authored by Muhamad Yusuf Kawkan Umri and others like that<br /><br />Hafidh Dhahabi and other than him have declared Hafidh Ibn Taymiyyah as “al-Mujtahid” and Hafidh Ibn Taymiya himself has said,<br /><br />“I only take from the madhab of Ahmad (Ibn Hanbal) which I know (is backed up with proofs and evidences). I don’t do taqlid of him” (I’lam ul-Muwaqi’in of Ibn al-Qayim 2/241-242)<br /><br />Death: 20 Dhul Qa’da 728 Hijri at the place of Qal’a, Damsacus in prison. Meaning he died whilst being in prison. May Allah have mercy on him and enter him into Janah.
