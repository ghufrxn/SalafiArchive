It is obligatory that he prays towards a barrier (sutrah). It makes no difference whether he is praying in a mosque or elsewhere, nor whether the mosque is large or small. This is because of the all-embracing statement of the Prophet (ﷺ),<br /><br /><em>“Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone walk in front of you. So if a person insists (on trying to pass) then fight him, because he has an evil companion along with him,”</em> meaning a devil.<br /><br />18. It is obligatory that he is close to it, since the Prophet (ﷺ) commanded that.<br /><br />19. Between his (ﷺ) place of prostration and the wall towards which he prayed there would be a space approximately wide enough for a sheep to pass through. So if one does likewise then he has carried out the closeness that is obligatory upon him.
