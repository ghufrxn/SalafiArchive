				<div class="content">Sheikh Muhammed bin Saleh Al Uthaymeen (rahimahullah) said:<br /><br /><strong><em>From the benefits of learning the Arabic language is correction of the tongue with the Arabic tongue which the speech of Allah was revealed in. Because of this, understanding the Arabic language is extremely important. But the sciences of the Arabic language are difficult in the beginning and become easy thereafter. It is the example of a house made of cane (the likes of sugar cane), but its door is made of steel. Meaning, it is difficult for one to enter, but once one does, it is then made easy. Due to this, I encourage the student to learn the foundations of the language in order to make the rest easy for him/her. </em></strong><br /><br />(Sharh Al Ajromiyah pg.9)</div>
