				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">How Does The Muslim Preserve His Creed?</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> How does the Muslim correct and preserve his creed?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Sheikh ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Baaz, may Allaah’s mercy be upon him, answered:</span></strong><br /><br />“(Firstly) by him gaining understanding in the religion and educating himself about it until he is aware of the correct creed and (the way) to preserve it.<br /><br />As well as asking the People of Knowledge. If he is a student of knowledge, then he can contemplate over the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, i.e. Prophetic Way of the Prophet may peace and blessings be upon him, until he knows the correct creed that the Qur’aan (and Sunnah) call to and he clings on to it and remains steadfast upon it. If he has any problems then he asks the Scholars, those whom he trusts and feels comfortable with, about that which is troubling him. So that he can be upon clarity.”<br /><br />[Source:http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/10261|Translated by: Abu Fouzaan Qaasim]</div>
