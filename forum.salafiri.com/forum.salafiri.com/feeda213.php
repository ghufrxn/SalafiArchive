<category term="Shiaism" scheme="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewforum.php?f=18" label="Shiaism"/>
<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=881&amp;p=925#p925"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Some of the Beliefs (‘Aqeedah) of the Raafidah (Shee’ah) from Their Own Shee’ah Sources.</span></strong><br /><br />1) To believe Jibreel [Peace be upon him] made a mistake in giving the revelation Prophet Muhammad [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] and should have instead gave it to ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib [May Allaah be Pleased with him]. [see: al-Mihal wa an-Nihal (Pg. 30)]<br /><br />2) There is no difference between the Shee’ah scholars and Allaah, the Most High. [see: Masaabeeh al-Anwaar (2/222-397)]<br /><br />3) The Quraan is distorted and incomplete. [see: at-Tanbeeh wa ar-Radd (Pg. 25)]<br /><br />4) The Shee’ah scholars came to complete the religion because the Prophet Muhammad [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him] only gave us part of the religion. [see: Ihqaaq al-Haqq (2/288-289)]<br /><br />5) The Shee’ah scholars are a vice for us to get closer to Allaah, the Most High. So one is required to supplicate to them and not Allaah. [see: Bihaar al-Anwaar (23/99)]<br /><br />6) The Shee’ah scholars have the ability to control the universe and have the same Names and Attributes as Allaah, the Most High. [see: al-Kaafee (1/103)]<br /><br />7) Visiting the graves of Hussayn is like visiting the Throne of Allaah. [see: al-Mizaar al-Mufeed (Pg. 51)]<br /><br />8) The sand on the grave of Hussayn is a cure for all illnesses. [see: Kitaab al-Amaalee (Pg. 318)]<br /><br />9) ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib has the ability to bring the deceased back to life and some sects within the Raafidah even worship him as being a god. He knows the unseen and that he is the lord of the earth that lives on earth, according to them. [see: al-Kaafee (1/308 and 347)]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Raafidah (Shee’ah) are the Worst and Most Ignorant of People</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The Raafidah (Shea’ah) are from the most ignorant of sects. They are the worst of liars and furthest away from understanding the narrations (i.e. texts of al-Islaam) and intellect. They make lying and deceiving (what they call Taqiyyah) from the basis of their religion, so they lie knowingly attributing it to Ahl al-Bayt (the family of Prophet Muhammad whom they worship) with the worst of lies, to which none can count except Allaah.<br /><br />[Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (13/263)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Because they are Liars, their Narrations and Account of History is Rejected and Cannot be Relied upon.</span></strong><br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The origin of the innovation of the Raafidah is based upon heresy and atheism and they heavily rely on lying to support their beliefs. They are persistent in saying that the religion is based upon Taqiyyah. Taqiyyah is say something one may say to someone but you mean something different to what is understood from your speech. This form of Taqiyyah that they use is based upon hypocrisy and lies. They call people to this false belief whilst they claim that they are believers, and that there is no one upon the correct religion except them. They describe the best of this generation (i.e. the Companions) as being hypocrites and all of them (except a few) being apostates from the religion!...<br /><br />Therefore, there are no people who have apparent hypocrisy and are bigger apostates than them, and no one will find a group of deviants except that the Raafidah have the greatest number of apostates and hypocrites.<br /><br />[Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (1/30)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">They Venerate the Day of ‘Ashooraa as a Day of Mourning because of the Death of Hussayn [May Allaah be Pleased with him]</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />The Raafidah (Shee’ah) take this day as a day of mourning because it is the day in which Hussayn, the son of ‘Alee, was killed.<br /><br />Taking this day as a day of mourning is from the deeds of those who are misguided and that they think that they are doing something good and righteous (cf. 18:104).<br /><br />Allaah has not Commanded nor did His Messenger to take the days in which the Prophets were inflicted with hardness or the days in which they died; as a day of mourning, so then what about those who lesser than them?<br /><br />Adapted from Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif (Pg. 43-45)<br /><br />Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />It can never be beautified to anyone as to what the Raafidah do on this day. They mourn the death of Hussayn but his father, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib [May Allaah be Pleased with them both], was better than him but they don’t mourn the death of ‘Alee after he was murdered. ‘Uthmaan, ‘Umar and Aboo Bakr [May Allaah be Pleased with them all] passed away before them and they didn’t mourn their deaths either and they were better than him…<br /><br />Rather the best of creation, the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be Upon him] passed away before them and his death was not mourned either.<br /><br />However, what they do to venerate this day to mourn the death of Hussayn has never been done before to mourn the deaths of those better than him. Moreover, taking a day as mourning is not the way of the Muslims, whatsoever. Rather, it is the way of the pagans of Makkah before al-Islaam.<br /><br />[Adapted from Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (25/307)]<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">History tells us that Yazeed bin Mu’awiyyah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] did not order the killing of Hussayn.</span></strong><br /><br />Ibn Salaah [May Allaah have Mercy on him] said:<br /><br />There is no authentic narration stating that Yazeed ordered the killing of Hussayn. What is authentic is that he ordered the killing of the one who ordered the killing of Hussayn, and his name was ‘Ubayd-Allaah bin Ziyaad, the governor of Iraq at that time. As for reviling Yazeed and cursing him then this is not the character of a Muslim, even if we were to affirm the accusation that he ordered the killing of Hussayn.<br /><br />[Qayd ash-Shareed min Akhbaar Yazeed (Pg. 57-59)]<br /><br />Imaam adh-Dhahabee said about Shimar bin Dhee al-Jawshaan:<br /><br />He was one of the killers of Hussayn [May Allaah be Pleased with him]. Him and his chosen group of men assassinated him.<br /><br />It is narrated that he said, “Oh Allaah! You Know that I am honourable to forgive me.”<br /><br />So it was said to him, “How can you be forgiven when you killed the son of the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and Blessings of Allaah be upon him]?”<br /><br />He replied by saying, “Woe to you! What else can I do when I had been ordered by the governor to do so and I cannot disobey the command of those in authority.”<br />I say (adh-Dhahabee): This excuse is disgusting, because obedience to those in authority is only upon what is righteous.<br /><br />[Lisaan al-Meezaan (3/152) also see: Meezaan al-‘Itidaal (1/449), Kaamil fi at-Tareekh Ibn Atheer (4/55) and al-Bidaayah wa an-Nihaayah (7/270)]<br /><br />And Allaah Knows Best<br /><br /><strong><em>Source:</em></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/the-raafidah-sheeah-their-beliefs-and.html">http://ahledhikr.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10 ... s-and.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Dec 22, 2016 10:57 pm</p><hr />

<category term="Shiaism" scheme="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewforum.php?f=18" label="Shiaism"/>
<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=820&amp;p=864#p864"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Errors of the Rafidah on Tawhid of Allah’s Names and Attributes</span></span></strong><br /><em>by Sheikh Ali ibn Yahya al-Haddaadee</em><br /><br />The Rafidah have also deviated in tawhid of Allah’s Names and Attributes. Our creed concerning our Lord can be summarized by everything that He has described Himself with, or His Prophet sall Allahu alaihi wa sallam described Him with, without saying how, giving examples, changing letters, or negating the meanings of words, to the extent of His statement (which translated means):<br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.” (Qur’an, 42:10)</span></strong></em><br /><br />However, we find that the Rafidah do not affirm this great principle, and along those lines, they have given their leaders some of the attributes of the Creator, if not all of them. From these is the attribute of perfect knowledge, as we, Ahl us Sunnah, believe that Allah has perfect knowledge which befits His Majesty -- knowledge which is not preceded by ignorance, nor overtaken by forgetfulness - - knowledge which encompasses everything that has existed, exists now, or will exist in the future, and that which will never exist or would exist if things were a certain way, as Allah Most High said (what translated means);<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything.” (Qur’an, 8:75)<br /><br />“All-Knower of the unseen and the seen.” (Qur’an, 6:73)<br /><br />“But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden.” (Qur’an, 6:25)</span></em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.” (Qur’an, 6:59)</span></em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“[Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said: ‘What about the generations of old?’ [Musa (Moses)] said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record. My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets.’&quot; (Qur’an, 20:51-2)</span></em></strong><br /><br />...until the rest of them.<br /><br />As for the Rafidah’s view, then they have set up partners for Him in knowledge of the unseen -- even knowledge of all things!<br /><br />In Bihar al-Anwar, by al-Majlisee, on the authority of Ja’far as-Sadiq alaihi assalaam, who said: “By Allah, I have been given knowledge of the very first and the very last. So a man from amongst his companions said: May I be made your ransom, do you have knowledge of the unseen? He said: woe be to you, I certainly know what is in the loins of men and the wombs of women... by Allah, if I wanted to count for you every pebble on it, I could certainly tell you (that).” (Bihar al-Anwar. 28, 26/27)<br /><br />And in al-Kaafee: “From Abdullah ibn Bashr reporting from Abu Abdullah, he said: surely, I know what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, and I know what is in Paradise and I know what is in the Fire, and I know what has been and what will be. He said: then he waited a moment and saw that this was having a major effect on those who heard it, so he said: I know all this from the Book of Allah azza wa jall. Verily, Allah ta`aalaa said: in it is the explanation of all things.” (al-Kaafee 1/261)<br /><br />Exalted is Allah, High and Magnificent, over what the wrong-doers say! I say: in this text is a twisting of the noble verse when he quoted the verse (which translated means):<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">“And We have sent down to you the Book (the Quran) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims).” (Qur’an, 16:89)</span></em></strong><br /><br />And how amazing it is that he claims to know everything, then he does not know the text of the verse which he is trying to prove his knowledge of everything with. And I swear by Allah that Abu Abdullah is free from this slander. Rather, he rejected the Rafidah and considered them to be stupid. So let yourself be amazed at this foolishness as much as you want to be amazed!<br /><br />We will not fail to direct the noble reader’s attention that at the same time the Rafidah are attributing knowledge of everything to their leaders, they are also claiming that Allah azza wa jall is ignorant and that some affairs are hidden from Him, and that knowledge can occur to Him of what He doesn’t know. Exalted is Allah over that, High and Magnificent. This, what they call <strong><em><span style="color: #0000FF">al-bidaa’</span></em></strong>, is a belief of the Jews -- and the Jews who distorted (the Scripture) are the first root of the tree of the Rafidah, as is known to the just -- and on the issue of al-bidaa’, it is reported by the author of al-Kaafee, on the authority of al-Rayyan ibn al-Salat who said: “I heard al-Rida say: Allah never sent any prophet except that he forbade alcohol and affirmed for Allah al-bidaa’.” (al-Kaafee, 1/148).<br /><br />Translated by Abdullah Boyd<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posterous.com">http://mtws.posterous.com</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2016 9:36 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shī’a Papers – Part 14 – Lies Fabricated Against Yazīd<br /> </span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span><br /><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong><br /><br /> <br /><br />All sorts of lies and fabrications are levied against Yazīd in order to discredit him. They also lie based on a deep rooted sentiment that Yazīd must be blamed for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu. These slanderous and treacherous accusations were concocted by none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.<br /><br />The undercover Ḥanafī Aquilani (Aqeel Ahmed) cited a few reports which elucidated that Yazīd was responsible for the death of companions, we will inshaAllāh address this point later. Just a basic rebound for this is there were numerous companions who were with Yazīd at the time and supported him, so will the same be levied against them.<br /><br />It is also alleged against that he killed hundreds of people and desecrated the Prophets Masjid and his resting place.<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah refutes this claim and says,<br /><br />“10,000 people were not killed and nor was blood spilled at the Prophets Masjid and grave and neither was there any fighting in the Prophets Masjid.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/253]<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah went on to say,<br /><br />“None of the Muslims rulers from amongst Banī Umayyah or Banī ʿAbbās travelled to the Kʿabah with the intention of desecrating it. The representative of Yazīd nor Hajjāj bin Yūsuf the representative of Abdul Mālik did this, in fact all of the Muslims respected the Kʿabah.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/254]<br /><br />Aquilani Ahmed the deceptive undercover Ḥanafī boldly threw a hideous accusation of, “you cannot digest the criticism against Yazīd” and this individual based his foolish accusation on a number of narrations. From among the narrations he presented was that a person mentioned Yazīds bin Muʿawīyyahs name and said Amīr al-Muʿminīn whereupon Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz [101H] ordered for the man to be lashed 20 times. [Siyār ʿAlām an-Nabulā 4/35-40] as Aquilani Ahmed quoted<br /><br />However, the authentic narration is as transmitted by Ibrāhīm bin Maisarah where he said,<br /><br />“I have never seen Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAzīz hit anyone except the man who cursed and abused Muʿawīyyah and he (Umar bin ʿAbdul ʿAziz) lashed him.” [Sārim al-Maslūl ʿAla Shātim ar-Rasūl [pg.574], al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/139], Ṣawāʿiq Mehrqah [pg.221] and Nibrās [pg.551] of ʿAllāmah ʿAbdul ʿAziz Farhārwī [d.1239H], see also Nāhīyah ʿAnn Dham Muʿawīyyah [pg.20]<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shia-papers-part-14-lies-fabricated-against-yazid/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:16 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shī’a Papers – Part 13 – Yazīds Orders and was he Responsible for Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu’s Death</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span><br /><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong><br /><br /> <br /><br />After cursing and hurling abuse at Yazīd, the Shīʿa Rāfiḍah then begin to abuse the governor of Kūfah, Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād who died in the year 64H. They allege that when he came to Kūfah at the behest of Yazīd he was ordered to capture Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and to kill him.<br /><br />A few days ago it was relayed to us by the admin of <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.Salafiri.com">http://www.Salafiri.com</a><!-- m --> Facebook account that an undercover Ḥanafī and neo-Jahmī whilst posing as an Ahle Ḥadīth was vehemently arguing in declaring Yazīd a fāsiq and a drunkard and thus someone to be shunned etc etc.<br /><br />This undercover person is known to troll and give the false idea that he is an Ahle Ḥadīth when in actual fact from this language as well as other reasons that he is as an ardent Ḥanafī. The readers may know him as Aquilani Ahmed.<br /><br />After seeing the screen shots of his conversation with the admin he ignorantly claims after retracting his initial position that although Yazīd may have been free of the murder of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu he is still responsible and accountable for not bringing the culprits to justice.<br /><br />What this mischief maker and ignorant person Aquilani Ahmed (an alias for Aqeel Ahmed) failed to realise is that he did take account of the culprits who were none other than the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa.<br /><br />Secondly we find from the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clearly instructed on the contrary ie to only secure Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu.  <br /><br />Imām Ṭabarī and Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr mention that Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād said,<br /><br />“If Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu does not intend to come to us then we do not have any concern.” (meaning coming to Kūfah to see the treacherous and deceptive Rāfiḍah Shīʿa) [Tārīkh al-Umam Wal Malūk [4/282], Al-Bidāyah Wan Nihayah [8/157]<br /><br />The Shīʿa authors Mullā Bāqir Majlīsī, Muḥsin Amīn Āmālī and Shaikh Mufīd all mention,<br /><br />“As for Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu does not intend to come to us then we also will not have any concern.” [Kitāb al-Irshād [pg.251], Lūwaʿij al-Ashjān [pg.57] and Jalā al-ʿAyūn [pg.366]<br /><br />Furthermore, the instructions and guidance which Yazīd sent to Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād was clear and specific and both the books of Ahlus Sunnah and the Shīʿa mention this, which was,<br /><br />“I (meaning Yazīd) have been informed that Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu has left for ʿIrāq therefore place watchers at the frontiers. Keep a watch over the people you suspect (ie those who sent letters to Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu inviting him to Kūfah) and arrest those who have been blamed and have allegations levied against them. However, do not fight anyone that does not fight you and continue updating me with whatever happens.

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shī’a Papers – Part 12 – Yazīd Venerating, Respecting and Honouring the Family of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ‘Anhu<br /></span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span><br /><strong>Abū Ḥibbān &amp; Abū Khuzaimah Anṣārī</strong><br /><br />The Shīʿa Rāfiḍah over the centuries have conjured up numerous lies and allegations upon Ahlus Sunnah. The most dangerous and grave of these is the fabrication of narration is and then making them so common and widespread that the masses are fooled into thinking they are authentic and established.<br /><br />Once such narration is what the Shīʿa narrator ‘Ibād bin Ya’qūb Rawājanī Al-Kūfī has falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allāh (Sallalahu Alayhee Wasallam) where he allegedly said,<br /><br />“When you see Mu‘āwīyyah giving a sermon on my pulpit then kill him.”<br /><br /> Then without any doubt whatsoever this false narration is an outright and clear lie without any basis.<br /><br />The authors of the following books have elucidated this,<br /><br />Hāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr in Al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/133],<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/210],<br /><br />Hāfiẓ Ibn al-Jawzī in Mawdhū‘āt Al-Kabīr [2/26],<br /><br />Shaikh Qaisarānī in Tazkirratul Al-Madhū‘āt [pg.23],<br /><br />Hāfiẓ Dhahabī in Mīzān ul-Eitidāl [2/380, 613],<br /><br />Hāfiẓ Ibn Hajr Al-Asqālānī in Tahdhīb ut-Tahdhīb [5/96]<br /><br />and Hāfiẓ Suyuti in Al-Lālī Masnū‘a [1/425]<br /><br />In Islam numerous principles and rules are established in respect and honour of the Muslim women. They are respected and cherished as noble chaste women and so these Pristine vanguards have seen established to preserve the honour and dignity of Muslim women.<br /><br />The Rāfiḍah Shī‘a prey on this powerful Muslim sentiment and have formulated some despicable lies and fabricated distortions. <br /><br />They claim the soldiers of Umar Ibn Sa‘d gathered the veiled and honourable women of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ‘Anhu and paraded them on camels without any saddles around the city. <br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah rebukes this horrendous lie and says, <br /><br />“As for what has been mentioned with regards to the soldiers parading the Women (of Ḥussain RaḍiAllahu Anhu) on camels thought the cities without saddleback is a total and manifest lie and it is false “ [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/239]<br /><br />The Shī‘a public speakers and story tellers in order to play with the emotion of the people have portrayed a grave picture of the events post Karbala in order to play with the sensitive emotion of the general Muslims. They present the incidences in such a deceptive way that even a normal Muslims hair would stand on end. <br /><br />All of the women of the household of Ḥussain RadiAllāhu Anhu especially his wives were sent to Shām with great respect and reverence. They were seated in carriages with an envoy of guards under their security and protection.<br /><br />The well know Shī‘a historian Abū Hanīfah Dinawarī said,<br /><br />“Umar Ibn S‘ad ordered that the women of the household of Ḥussain RadiAllāhu Anhu, his sisters, his daughters, his female servants to be guarded and veiled and then taken on camels” [Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.259] Shī‘ī]<br /><br />As already mentioned in Part 11 that Yazīd did not order the killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu Anhu but rather his safe secure.<br /><br />This then follows that when the news reached the Capital of the Muslim world, which was Dimishq in Shām. When Yazīd was informed of the tragic events at Karbala He became very upset and his household started to mourn. [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/239], Majmū’a Fatāwa [27/480] both of Shaikh ul-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah]<br /><br />When Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu Anhu’s family was taken to Shām to Yazīd, they were honoured and respected. Yazīd and his family were honourable with them as the books of history mention.<br /><br />When Yazīd would eat Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu Anhu’s two sons, Alī bin Ḥussain Zaīn Al-‘Ābidīn and Umar bin Ḥussain would both sit with Yazīd whilst eating. Hāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr and Imām At-Ṭabarī have both stated this. [Al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/195], Tārīkh Ṭabarī [4/353]<br /><br />The Shī‘ī author Mullā Bāqir Majlisī states,<br /><br />“Ahlul Baīt stayed with him (ie Yazīd) he would call Imām Zaīn Al-Ābidīn morning and evening to eat with him.” [Jalā Al-‘Ayūn [pg.617] Shī‘a, Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.261] Shī‘a]. <br /><br />Yazīd then presented two options to them to either stay with him to return to Madīnah. Imām Ibn Taymīyyah mentions in three of his works,<br /><br />“He (Yazīd) then presented two options to them either to stay with him or to return to Madīnah. so they decided to return back to Madīnah.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/249], Majmū’a Fatāwa [27/480] and in Risālah Rās Al-Ḥussain [p.29]<br /><br />Hāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr mentions, <br /><br />“They were helped to prepare and a lot of provisions were provided for them.” [Al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah [8/195]<br /><br />Imām at-Ṭabarī adds,<br /><br />“A righteous and trustworthy man from Shām was sent with them, an animal and a helper was sent so that they are not burdened.” [Tārīkh Ṭabarī [4/254]<br /><br />The old Shī‘a historian, Abū Hanīfah Dīnawarī who died in 290H said,<br /><br />“He (Yazīd) prepared them with abundant provisions and said to Alī bin Ḥussain to accompany and travel with his women until they reach their destination ie their land. He then sent a group of 30 men on horseback to ride in front of the travelling caravan. When the caravan would stop the men on horseback would stand far away and eventually they led them to Madīnah.” [Akhbār at-Tawāl [pg.261]<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shia-papers-part-12-yazid-venerating-respecting-and-honouring-the-family-of-%E1%B8%A5ussain-ra%E1%B8%8Diallahu-anhu/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:12 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Shia Papers Part 11 – Some False Allegations on Yazīd</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Compiled, Translated and Annotated</span><br /><strong>Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari</strong><br /><br />History has seen whenever a group of people is responsible for a heinous crime they always attempt to blame others, at the same time they deny and reject any responsibility.<br /><br />The Rāfiḍah Shīʿa are so corrupt and deceptive in their portrayal of the true affair of Karbala that one begs a question that if Yazīd was so bad and evil which made him responsible for the death and killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, why do the Shīʿa mourn, lament and act this false drama of beating themselves up. The fact of the matter is there can only be one truth.<br /><br />They blame Yazīd but they also beat themselves up for being responsible. This shows the Shīʿas need to have a reality check and ask themselves what kind of religion encourages such violent behaviour to the extent that young children to adults are made to suffer in pain.<br /><br />It is a true reality that the Shīʿas themselves were responsible for the death and the slaughter of the family of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, May Allāh raise their rank, Amīn.  <br /><br />Thus, in scape goating others the Shīʿa have fabricated and concocted all sorts of lies, slander and centuries of a smear campaign against Yazīd Rahimahullāh and Mūʿawiyyah RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and a vicious and brutal onslaught of their character and personalities.<br /><br />The actual facts and realities are totally contrary to what Shīʿa speakers and story tellers have been inaccurately regurgitating from their repugnant books   <br /><br />For example the Shīʿa say from their fabrications that when the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was taken to Yazīd Rahimahullah he his teeth and face with hit a stick.<br /><br />This is indeed one of the worst lies the Shīʿa can fabricate, Imām Ibn Taymīyyah repudiates this lie and says,<br /><br />“This is not established as the narration itself contains the reason it is lie and that is when this incident allegedly and supposed happened, the companions were not in Shām but rather they were in Iraq.” (Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/249)<br /><br />They further add to this and say the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was paraded around in the cities and in Sham. Then this is also an arch lie and the head of Hussain RadhiAllahu Anhu was not paraded at all as the Rāfiḍah Shīʿa claim. (Refer to Farsī Ṣharh Qasīdah Amālī (pg.23) and Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/249)<br /><br />With this is the false allegation that Yazīd was responsible for Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu’s death. Which again is totally incorrect that Yazīd was responsible for the death of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu, that he gave the order or that he was happy with it. (Refer to Fatāwa (4/486). Wafyāt al-ʿAyān (1/328) Mir’ah al-Janān (3/176), al-Bidāyah Wan-Nihāyah (12/173), Ṣharh Fiqh ul-Akbar (pg.88), Nibrās (pg.544), Ḍhu’a al-Mʿālī (pg.50), Minhāj as-Sunnah (4/179), Sawāʿiq al-Meḥrqah (pg.223).<br /><br />It is further cited that Yazīd did not order the killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and the people of texts are in agreement in this. (al-Muntaqa Min Minhāj al-ʿE’tidāl (pg.292), Minhāj as-Sunnah (2/225)<br /><br />Yazīd had no intention of killing Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu but rather he just wanted him to be kept away from the Khilāfah and control any further support and uprising against his rule.<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah clearly said,<br /><br />“More than one scholar has said that Yazid did not order the killing of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu nor was this his intention. In fact Yazīd respected and honoured him as his father Muʿāwiyyah instructed him. Yazīd wanted to control and prevent Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu from forming a Khilāfah and rebelling against him.” [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/249]<br /><br />This is also the reason why some of the leaders of the armies were very respectful of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu and his family just as Yazīd had instructed Ubaidullāh bin Ziyād when he sent him from Shām. He said to him to prevent Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu from reaching the outposts of the Islamic kingdom. [Minhāj as-Sunnah [2/225]  <br /><br />Another lie the Rāfiḍah Shī’a utter is that the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was taken to Shām and presented to Yazīd. Their aim here is to deceive the people and emotionally coerce them into thinking of the oppression which was forced on Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu so much so that his head was severed from his body???<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah clearly said,<br /><br />“The head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was not brought to Shām at all.” [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [3/412 and 27/490]<br /><br />He further said,<br /><br />“Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu head being bought to Yazīd is Bāṭil ie false and the chain for this is disconnected ie weak.” [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [27/470], Minhāj as-Sunnah [4/179]<br /><br />Imām Ibn Taymīyyah further refutes this deceptive notion and says,<br /><br />“As for the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu the scholars are agreed that it was not taken to Egypt or Shām.” [Majmūʿa al-Fatāwa [3/412 and 27/490]<br /><br />Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr said,<br /><br />“I say, that which is correct is that the head of Ḥussain RaḍiAllāhu ʿAnhu was not taken to Shām.” [al-Bidāyah Wan Nihāyah [8/165]<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shia-papers-part-11-some-false-allegations-on-yazid/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:07 pm</p><hr />

These people called me (to Koofah) and told me they would help me but they just showed hostility and enmity towards me and also killed me.” (al-Irshaad pg.231 of al-Mufeed Shee’ah)<br /><br />Hence in this regard Sayyid Muhsin al-Ameen said, <br /><br />“20,000 people from Iraaq gave Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) pledge of allegiance (via letters and on the hand of Muslim Ibn Aqeel) and then they betrayed and deceived him and then came out in the open opposing him (at Karbala). Their pledge of allegiances are around their necks because they killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu).” (A’ayaan ash-Shee’ah Part 1, pg.34)<br /><br />Zain ul-Aabideen said to the people of Koofah, <br /><br />“Are you unaware that you yourselves wrote letters to my father and then you treacherously betrayed him whereas you people had vehemently promised your pledge of allegiance. You people fought with him and defeated him. So then, now tell me with what face do you look at the Household of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam)? So that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam) can say to you that you are the people that brutally killed my family and attacked my honour and dignity, you people (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) are not from my Ummah.” (al-Ehtijaaj 2/32 of Shee’ah Tabrasee)<br /><br />He further said, <br /><br />“These people are crying over us now, but who other than them killed us.” (al-Ehtijaaj 2/29 of Tabarasee Rafidhah Shee’ah)<br /><br />Fatima Sughra said, <br /><br />“Oh People of Koofah (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah), oh you deceivers, you treacherous arrogant people, Allaah has tested you with our affair ie the Ahlul Bayt and he also tested us. Did we not pass this test? You people lied to us, disrespected us, believed it was permissible to kill us, you considered our wealth to be lawful. You also did this to our forefathers and your swords are still bloodied with the blood of Ahlul Bayt. May Allaah destroy you, wait for his punishment and curse as this has become obligatory upon you. You will begin fighting with one another as a form of punishment and you will continue to be punished with severe torment until the day of judgement for oppressing us, beware as the curse of Allaah is upon the oppressors. May you people be destroyed, you people betrayed Alee bin Abee Taalib (RadhiAllaah Anhu), you betrayed my grandfather, his sons and this righteous household.” The people of Koofah heard this and said, “Yes! We killed Alee and both of his sons with our swords and spears, we captivated their women and we severely wounded them.” (al-Ehtijaaj 2/28)<br /><br />Zainab, The daughter of Alee (RadhiAllaah Anhu) said to the treacherous people of Koofah, <br /><br />“Oh you people of Koofah, you are a group of coward treacherous people your example is like that woman who cut her meat and separated it into different parts. What do you people have other than lying, having animosity and enmity for us. You (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) thought it was easy and cheap to kill the children of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallaahu Alayhee Wasallam)” (al-Ehtijaaj 2/29-30)<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shiah-papers-part-9-the-ahlul-bayt-refuting-the-kufi-rafidah-shiah-what-really-happened-at-karbala-who-was-responsible-b/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 1:01 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shi’ah Papers Part 8 – The Companions, Ali, Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllahu Anhuma) &amp; Yazid (Rahimahullah) – Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta<br /></span></strong><br /><br />Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br />Matters related to the Sahabah Fatwa no. 1466<br /><br />Question:  Many Turkish Muslims continually revile Mu`awiyyah and his son Yazid. Are they correct in doing this or not?<br /><br />Answer: Regarding Mu`awiyyah (may Allah be pleased with him), he was one of the Prophet’s Sahabah (Companions) and one of the scribes who wrote down the Revelation. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the best Mu’mins (believers). There are many reported prohibitions against reviling or cursing them. It is authentically reported in the two “Sahih (Books of Authentic Hadith)” that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The best people are my generation, then those who follow them, and then those who follow them.” It is also authentically reported that he (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse my Sahabah, because if any of you spent gold equal to (Mount) Uhud (in Allah’s Cause), it would not be equal to a Mud (a dry measure of half bushel, 543 grams) or even a half Mud of one of them.”<br /><br />It has been related with a good Sanad (chain of narrators) concerning Mu`awiyyah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book, reckoning, and protect him from an evil punishment.” This was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him).<br /><br />As this is known, the basic `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community) with regard to the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) includes the following:<br /><br />Firstly: Anyone cursing a Sahaby (Companion) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), whether Mu`awiyyah or another (may Allah be pleased with them), deserves a severe punishment. This is agreed upon by Muslim scholars, but they differ whether they should be killed or receive a less severe penalty.<br /><br />Secondly: The hearts and tongues of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are free of any hatred towards the Sahabah, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: And those who came after them say: “Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful. Thirdly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe that some of the Athar (narrations from the Companions) that are reported concerning their shortcomings are<br /><br />lies, others have been exposed to additions, subtractions, and alterations in their texts. The fact is that the Sahabah are excused if these narrations are true, as they were Mujtahids (scholars qualified to exercise juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings), who, if they were correct in their Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) will receive two rewards, and if they were wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.<br /><br />Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah do not believe that the Sahabah were infallible as far as major and minor sins are concerned, rather they were liable to commit sins and will be held accountable for them, but due to their preceding good deeds and virtues they will be forgiven for things that later generations will not. During the Reckoning, some of their sins will be erased in a way that will not happen for those after them. It has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that they were the best generation, and that a Mud or half a Mud given in charity by them is better than a mountain of gold given by others, as was explained previously.<br /><br />If any of the Sahabah committed a sin, they may have performed Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from it, performed good deeds that erased it, and they will be forgiven due to their preceding merits, through the intercession of Muhammad (peace be upon him), as they were the most deserving to receive it, or they may have been inflicted with a disaster in this world that expiated their sins. This is in regard to the sins that they actually committed, so what will be the case when it comes to matters of Ijtihad? If they were correct they will receive two rewards, and if they got it wrong they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and forgiven for their mistakes.<br /><br />But the degree of abhorrence that will be felt regarding any of their sins will be minimal next to their virtues and merits, from their belief in Allah and His Messenger, their Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah), their Hijrah (migration) with and support of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. Fourthly: Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah speaks moderately about matters related to the Sahabah;<br /><br />they refrain from talking about the disputes that occurred among them, and do not say that one group is infallible and another is sinful, other than in relation to those who made innovations in the religion, such as the Shi`ah (Shi’ites) and Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief). They exceeded the limits in opposite extremes in terms of infallibity and sins. Between them they produced the Bid`ah (innovations in religion) that was cursed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors), and they declared them to be Fasiqs (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) and Kafirs (disbelievers), except for a few, in the same way Khawarij regarded both `Aly and `Uthman as Kafirs and deemed it lawful to fight them.<br /><br />They were the group about which the Prophet said, “In time a group will secede from the Muslims and the group that is nearer to the Truth will kill them.” They were the group that killed `Aly after they had deserted him and declared all those who followed him as Kafirs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said with regard to Al-Hasan ibn `Aly: “This son of mine is a Sayyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.” And indeed, he did reconcile between the followers of `Aly and Mu`awiyyah, which shows that he did what Allah and His Messenger loved, and that the two groups were not like the Khawarij, whom the Messenger of Allah commanded to be fought. This was why `Aly was happy to fight the Khawarij, and was grieved and pained about the Battles of Siffin and Al-Jamal.<br /><br />The two groups have therefore to be freed from the charge of Kufr and Allah should be supplicated to be merciful with their dead, as this matter is agreed upon. All those who belonged to those two groups were Mu’mins (believers) and the Qur’an attests to the fact that those who fought were<br /><br />believers, and it did not take them out of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. The Hadith that states that if two caliphs fought and one of them is cursed, is false and fabricated, as it is not reported by any of the Hadith scholars. Mu`awiyyah did not claim the caliphate for himself and the Ba`yah (pledge of allegiance) was not made to him when he was fighting against `Aly.<br /><br />He did not fight `Aly because he considered himself to be the rightful caliph or that he thought he deserved to be. Neither he nor his supporters wanted to initiate a fight with `Aly, it was only when `Aly told them to swear allegiance and obedience to him, so there would not be two caliphs, that they refused their obedience. It was then that `Aly had no alternative but to fight them, to force them to obey him and maintain the Muslim community, as Mu`awiyyah and his supporters were saying that this was not obligatory on them until `Uthman’s (may Allah be pleased with him) rights had been taken from those in `Aly’s army who had rebelled and killed him.<br /><br />As for Yazid ibn Mu`awiyyah, the people differed concerning him, and they split into three groups, two extreme and one moderate. One of them was that he was one of the Muslim rulers, who did good deeds and bad ones. He was not born until the caliphate of `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). He was not a Kafir, but it was due to him that the death of Husayn occurred, and what happened to the people of Al-Harrah. He was not a Sahaby, nor was he one of the `Awliya (pious people). This is the view held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him), the general opinion of most of the intelligent<br /><br />and knowledge people, and the view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. As for cursing him, people are equally split on this into three groups: One that cursed him, another that loved him, and a third that neither cursed nor loved him. Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) said, “This is what was reported from Imam Ahmad, his fair-minded followers, and others from the Muslim community.<br /><br />This moderate opinion is based on the fact that his Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) was not established in a way that makes cursing him permissible, or that the specified Fasiq (one flagrantly violating Islamic law) is not entitled to be cursed, whether due to a prohibition or out of respect. It has been authentically reported in “Sahih Al-Bukhari”, on the authority of `Umar – in the story about `Abdullah ibn Himar, who regularly drank Khamr (intoxicants) and was whipped for it by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) – that when some of the Sahabah cursed him, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Do not curse him, as he loves Allah and His Messenger.” He (peace be upon him) also said, “Cursing a Mu’min is like killing them.” (Agreed upon by Muslim and Al-Bukhari).<br /><br />These texts, as the other that include warnings are general, such as those concerning consuming orphans’ wealth unlawfully, Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), and theft, are not to be taken as proof that the person concerned will be one of the dwellers in the Fire, due to the possibility of the absence of binding conditions for a predominating reason. This reason may be due to Tawbah (repentance to Allah), good deeds, expiating circumstances, an accepted intercession, or any other cause for expiation of sins. All the above reasons make it prohibited to curse him, but as for not loving Yazid, because he did not perform the good deeds that necessitate loving him, and accordingly, he was one of the Muslim rulers,<br /><br />but loving this type of person is not lawful, because he performed actions that testified to his Fisq and injustice and these are evident from his biography and in the matters related to Husayn and the people of Al-Harrah.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success!

<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Shi’ah Papers Part 7 – The Rafidah Shi’ah &amp; Their Real Love For Ahlul Bayt &amp; What The Ahlul Bayt Really Thought Of The Rafidah Shi’ah</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Compiled, Translated and Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br /> <br /><br />(clink link) The Shi’ah Paper – Part 6<br /><br />The Rafidhah Shee’ah are famous to promote and boldly attest to their love and affiliation with the Ahlul Bayt. The Madhab of the Rafidhah Shee’ah is established on the essence of the Ahlul Bayt and their love, friendship, hatred and animosity for anyone is based on the Ahlul Bayt, the Ahlul Bayt are their criteri <br /><br />It is on this basis they hate the companions more so the 3 rightly guided Khulapha (May Allaah be pleased with them), all the Rafidhah Shee’ah from amongst the men, women, teenagers, old and young all hate our companions (May Allaah Guide those who hate our companions. Ameen) because in their narrow bigoted minds they think the companions oppressed the Ahlul Bayt, killed and dishonoured them. These are obviously all lies and fallacies but lying with the Rafidhah Shee’ah has no bounds or limit.<br /><br />However looking whilst looking deeper in to the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah they show and prove the Rafidhah Shee’ah actually really deep down hate and have enmity for the Ahlul Bayt and this also ties with our opinion that the Rafidhah Shee’ah are the ones who really unjustly killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt.<br /><br />So from the books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah we have<br /><br />Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, <br /><br />“If I were to mention a characteristic of the Shee’ah then it is that they just like to talk, if I was to coerce them into a trials or tribulations they would become murtad (ie apostate) and if I wanted to test their sacrifice (ie with their lives) then not even one from amongst a thousand (1000) would be able to fulfil this.” (al-Kaafee, ar-Raudah 8/338)<br /><br />Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) narrates, <br /><br />“Oh you wannabe men who imitate men, oh you who have the intelligence of children and oh you, you group of opinionated entertainers, I wish I had never seen you people nor had any acquaintance with you. I swear by Allaah you have afflicted and depressed me, may Allaah destroy and ruin you. You have saddened my heart and filled my chest with sorrow and grief. You have always shown me enmity and always opposed and failed by advice and plans at every instance based on your continuous disobedience and cowardliness. To the extent that people from amongst the Quraish are saying Abee Taalibs son (ie himself ie Alee) is a brave person but he has no experience or expertise in war but in reality there is no goodness in the opinion or plans of such person who is not obeyed.” (Nahj al-Balagha pg.70-71)       <br /><br />Alee (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) further said, <br /><br />“They are deaf besides having ears, speechless besides having a tongue, blind besides having eyes, they meet people without love and sincerity. They are people who not help other people at times of need, you people abandoned Ibn Abee Taalib (ie himself ie Alee RadhiAllaahu Anhu) in times when he needed their help just as menstruation flesh leaves a woman.” (Nahj al-Balagha pg.132)<br /><br />These people are the very same people who killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), these Koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah who in this current era shift blame from themselves to the so called Yazeedee group, when in reality it is an established fact based on narrations and reports from Shee’ah books that the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah themselves killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu). What is further interesting ins the people who allege the koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt are the surviving members of Ahlul Bayt them themselves quoted in the own books of the Rafidhah Shee’ah!!!!!! (Refer to the Part 8)<br /><br />This is also the reason why other Rafidhah Shee’ah authors have elucidated further to this fact and it must be known to the dear reader there is no bigotry or staunchness from our part, we are merely reproducing statements from Rafidhah Shee’ah books and authors.<br /><br />Hasan (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) said, <br /><br />“I swear by Allaah I find Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) much better than these people who attribute themselves to my group (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah), they tried to kill me, confiscated my wealth, It is better that my family are safe that these people kill me and my Ahlul Bayt are spared. I swear by Allaah if I had fought Mu’awiyyah (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) these people (ie Rafidhah Shee’ah) would have captured me and wringed my neck, therefore I consider a life of reconciliation much better than being captured deceptively and being killed.” (al-Ehtijaaj 2/10 of Tabarasee Shee’ah)<br /><br />Baaqir (Rahimahullah) said, <br /><br />“If you people become our Shee’ah (became our group) then one third 1/3 of them would stabs us in the back and another part them would be a group of stupid foolish people.” (Rijaal Kashee pg.79)<br /><br />Ja’afar Saadiq (Rahimahullah) said, <br /><br />“If there were not three people from amongst you who do not hide what I say then I would not even consider it permissible for them to even hide one thing.” (Usool al-Kaafee 1/396)<br /><br />All of the above statements show what the members of Ahlul Bayt really thought of these koofee Rafidhah Shee’ah, their morals, their integrity, their disloyalty and their deceptive treacherous nature.<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-shiah-papers-part-7-the-rafidhah-sheeah-their-real-love-for-ahlul-bayt-what-the-ahlul-bayt-really-thought-of-the-rafidah-shiah/</strong><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 12:28 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Shi’ah Paper – Part 6</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Raful al-Laa’imah Aanil Ai’mah – Lifting the Blame From the Imams Series – Part 20 – In Defence of Yazid ibn Mu’awiyyah Part 4</span></strong><br /><br /><br />In Defence of Yazid ibn Mu’awiyyah (Rahimahullah)<br /><br />Series Part 20 / Part 4<br /><br />By<br /><br />Series Compilers, Translated and Annotated<br /><br />Abu Hibbaan &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ansaari<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Issue Of Cursing Yazeed (Rahimahullah)<br /><br />From The Words of Imaam Ghazaalee, Revered With The Soofee Bareilwee Hanafees. <br /><br />This issue unfortunately is very common custom nowadays in that cursing and abusing yazeed rolls off the top of the tongue such much so that big so called Allaamahs and scholars consider this normal and permissible. Furthermore the standard is that there is no harm in abusing or cursing Yazeed all in the name of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and so in this is a definite sign of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt is cursing and abusing Yazeed (Rahimahullah).<br /><br />However these Soofee Bareilwee Hanafees doing this on their tv channels, like DM Digital, Ummah, Noor etc on a daily basis is contrary the Sunnah and these soofee bareilwees manifest elements of their shee’ism. These people are unaware of the Sunnah and also ignorant of the position of the Scholars of research and verification who have prohibited and warned from cursing and abusing Yazeed.<br /><br />They also clarified that Yazeed directly himself had no involvement in the unlawful death of Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), nor did he order any such tragedy and nor was he happy with what occurred. We will just present the statements of Imaam Ghazzalee who is well respected and revered amongst the soofees and bareilwee Hanafees, he said,<br /><br />“It is not correct that he (Yazeed) killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), or gave such an order nor was he happy or in agreement with this so when all of this is not established from him how can one conjecture or assume this about him as assuming (such negative) things about a Muslim are Haraam (unlawful) as Allaah the Most High said, “Oh You who believe beware of a lot of conjecture for verily some conjecture is sin.”  This action does not clarify the actual reality if you do not know and it is obligatory for every muslims to assume good about another Muslim and so it is possible that same should apply to him (ie Yazeed)” (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)<br /><br />Similarly he said in another book,<br /><br />“If you are asked, is it permissible to curse Yazeed because he killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) or he was the one who ordered the killing? Then we will answer, this is not established or proven in reality and up until it is not established or proven it is not permissible to say he killed or gave the order to kill Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)” (Ihyaa Uloom ud-Deen 3/131)<br /><br />He Imaam Ghazzalee further said,<br /><br />“Supplicating on behalf of Yazeed for Allaah having mercy upon his is not permissible but rather it is recommended and it is constitutes the supplication, “Oh Allaah Forgive all the Believing men and women” because Yazeed was a believer, and Allaah knows best.” (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)<br /><br />Imaam Ghazaalee said, <br /><br />“Whoever thinks that Yazeed ordered the death of Hussain or he agreed to it then that person is the worst fool.” (Taareekh Ibn Khalkaan 1/465) <br /><br />Refer to the previous parts for further statements from Imaam Ghazzalee. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/raful-al-laaimah-aanil-aimah-lifting-the-blame-from-the-imams-series-part-20-in-defence-of-yazid-ibn-muawiyyah-part-4/">http://www.salafiri.com/raful-al-laaima ... ah-part-4/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 12:25 pm</p><hr />
