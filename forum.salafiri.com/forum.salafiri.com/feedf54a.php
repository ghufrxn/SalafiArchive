Regarding Those Who Claim That The Saudi State Fights The Religion<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />What is your advice to those who say that this country fights the deen and restricts the du’aat?<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />Since the Saudi state began, it has been aiding the deen and its people, and it was not set up except on this foundation. And now it aids the Muslims in every place with financial help, building Islamic centres and masaajid, sending du’aat, printing books foremost amongst them – the Noble Qur’aan, opening centres of learning and Sharee’ah colleges, and also it rules by the Islamic Sharee’ah and has an independent body for enjoining good and forbidding evil in every town. And all of that is a proof that this state aids Islaam and its people, and it is a thorn in the throats of the hypocrites and the people of evil and splitting. And Allaah will aid His Deen even if the mushrikeen and those of evil intentions hate it.<br /><br />And we do not say that this state is perfect in every way and that it doesn’t have any mistakes. Mistakes occur from everyone, but we ask Allaah to aid us in rectifying the mistakes. And if the one who said this; looked at himself he would find mistakes in himself which would prevent him from speaking about others and he would be ashamed to look at the people.<br /><br />Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br /><br />Taken from: Al-Ijaabaat al-Muhimmah fee Mashaakil il-Mudlahimmah, by Muhammad bin Fahad al-Husayn.<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com">http://www.fatwaislam.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/who-claim-that-saudi-state-fights-the-religion/">http://www.salafiri.com/who-claim-that- ... -religion/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 10:33 pm</p><hr />
