<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">Advice and Guidelines for those Performing Hajj – Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Author:</strong> Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo<br /><strong>Source</strong>: Al-Asaalah Magazine Issue 11 (pg. 45-47) <br /><strong>Translator</strong>: isma’eel alarcon – al-ibaanah.com<br /><br />Know, my fellow brother, that there are certain etiquettes to the Hajj, which one must abide by and adorn himself with, such as:<br /><br />1. <strong>Maintain cleanliness</strong> in your clothes, your tent, the place where you stay, and in your food and drink. This is because keeping clean will aid in preserving your health and in repelling sicknesses.<br /><br />2. <strong>Beware of dropping filth or spoiled food in the roads</strong> that people use, for it will cause those performing Hajj to be bothered, and it will cause diseases to spread. So one must remove harmful objects from the road and put them in their proper place (i.e. garbage).<br /><br />3. <strong>Bear the harm that comes from your neighbors with patience</strong>, and do not (let that cause you to) harm any of your brothers. Instead, repel their harm in a manner that is better, such as by using kind words.<br /><br />4. <strong>Avoid sexual relations, committing sins, arguing and debating with falsehood</strong>, so that your Hajj can be accepted. Listen to the words of Allaah:<br /><br />“So whoever intends to perform Hajj therein (in the months of Hajj), then he must NOT have sexual relations, nor commit sin, nor debate unjustly during Hajj.” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]<br /><br />And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“Whoever goes to Hajj and he does not have sexual relations in it nor does he commit sin, he returns back (from Hajj) like the day when his mother gave birth to him (i.e. free from sins).” [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]<br /><br />5. <strong>Be lenient in your buying and selling</strong>, and show good manners. And do not deal with anyone in a manner that he is not pleased with.<br /><br />6.<strong> Beware of smoking, displaying bad manners and insulting others</strong>, for reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.<br /><br />7. <strong>Do not waste your time in the market places</strong> – buying and selling – or in gossiping with the “he said/she said” talk.<br /><br />8. <strong>Be gentle with those around you</strong> when performing Tawaaf, kissing the Stone, the Sa’ee, and when throwing the stones (Ramee) and so on. This is from the gentleness that is required, for Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“Whoever is deprived of gentleness, he is deprived of all kinds of good.” [Reported in Saheeh Muslim]<br /><br />9. <strong>Do not raise your voice out loud when making du’aa (supplication) during Tawaaf</strong>, because it disturbs the others making Tawaaf.<br /><br />10. <strong>Do not push and shove people</strong>, especially when kissing the Black Stone. If it is too crowded and there is too much shoving, it is enough for you to just point in its direction.<br /><br />And when casting the stones (Ramee), it is not permissible for you to use large stones, because this has been forbidden in the religious texts and because it will cause harm to those standing (in front of you).<br /><br />Also, do not throw your shoes (instead of rocks) – as some ignorant people do – for this is a reprehensible act!<br /><br />Avoid touching the glass surrounding the Prophet’s grave, and avoid touching the walls of the Ka’abah. Rather what is to be touched and kissed from it is (only) the Black Stone. The Yemeni Corner is also touched. [1]<br /><br />11. <strong>You must shave your head or cut your hair very short when in the state of Hill</strong> (out of Ihraam), but beware of shaving the beard off, for that is forbidden according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.<br /><br />Allaah says:<br /><br />“…with (the hair on) their heads shaven or cut short…”<br /><br />Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“Trim the moustaches and leave the beards to grow – Do the opposite of the Majoos.” {Reported by Muslim]<br /><br />12. <strong>Beware of supplicating and calling out to other than Allaah</strong>, such as calling to deceased people or others not present. This is from the types of Shirk that Allaah has forbidden in His saying:<br /><br />“And do not call besides Allaah that which can neither bring you benefit nor cause you harm. If you do that, then you will be from the wrong-doers.”<br /><br />What is meant by “wrong-doers” in this ayah are the polytheists (those who commit shirk). If a Muslim commits Shirk, his good deeds become nullified and his Hajj is lost, as Allaah says:<br /><br />“And if you commit Shirk, We will surely cancel out your good deeds and you will indeed be from the losers.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]<br /><br />13. <strong>Beware of Riyaa</strong>, which is doing a deed for the sake of being seen or heard.<br /><br />An example of this when someone goes to Hajj so that it can be said of him “Hajji so and so.” The title Hajji (or Al-Hajj in Arabic) was not a term that was known to the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), so we cannot hear from any of them that he said about his brother “Hajji so and so.” Rather, this is from the innovations of those in recent times. So have sincerity in your Hajj and say as Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“O Allaah, (this is) a Hajj with no riyaa or sam’ah in it.” [2]<br /><br />14. <strong>Increase in your recitation of the Qur’aan</strong> and acting on what is in it, your performing of Tawaaf, your sending of Salaat on the Prophet. And make a lot of supplication, especially at night, because Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“Whoever wakes in the night and says when he awakens: ‘Laa Ilaaha IllAllaah wahdahu laa shareeka lahu. Lahul-Mulk wa lahul-Hamd wa Huwa ‘alaa Kulli shay’in Qadeer. SubhaanAllaah wal-Hamdu Lillaah wa Laa Ilaaha IllAllah wa-Allaahu Akbar wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata Illaa Billaah.’[3]<br /><br />And then he says: ‘Allaahumma Ighfir Lee’ or some supplication, he will be answered. And if he makes ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.” [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree]<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br /><br />[1] Translator’s Note: The Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br /><br />“Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner removes sins.”<br /><br />[Reported by At-Timrimidhee and Ibn Khuzaimah and authenticated by Al-Albaanee in his book on Hajj.<br /><br />[2] Translator’s Note: Riyaa means doing deeds to be seen and Sam’ah means doing deeds to be heard.<br /><br />[3] Translator’s Note: This means:<br /><br />“There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah – alone and with no partner. To Him belongs the Dominion and the Praise and He is Able over all things. Glory be to Allaah, all praise be to Allaah, and there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah. And there is no movement nor power except by Allaah’s permission.”<br /><br />The next phrase means: “O Allaah, forgive me.”<br /><br />Taken from: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/23/advice-and-guidelines-for-those-performing-hajj/" class="postlink">https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/23/advice-and-guidelines-for-those-performing-hajj/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Aug 25, 2016 10:19 pm</p><hr />
