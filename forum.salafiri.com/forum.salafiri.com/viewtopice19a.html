I pray all my 5 Salah and try my best to abide by Islamic Principles in everything I do. I simply believe in following the Qur’an and Sunnah. My every day dress consists of hijab and abaya. <br /><br />Preferred age range<br /> 27-36<br /><br />Thoughts on relocation<br /> I would be willing to relocate within the UK. <br /><br />Interests/Other info <br />Although I realise the importance of working life, I don’t see it as a main priority. Whilst I do enjoy it, I don’t envisage myself working full time in the future. Instead I hope to spend my free time with loved ones and focusing on more productive things such as learning more into deen. I am extremely family orientated and I love spending time at home with loved ones. I hope that in the future I can devote as much attention to my in-laws Insha’Allah. <br />My interests are quite varied, however essentially, I enjoy spending time socialising with family and friends. I have recently developed a passion for fitness and regularly attend a ladies-only gym and as such I am seeing positive results within myself Alhamdullilah. <br />The type of marriage partner I am looking for Insha’Allah would be someone who has a strong basis in practicing Islam, focusing on enhancing their own spirituality and understanding the importance of developing a practicing household. I strongly believe in honest, strong communication and hence I seek someone who is a good talker and of sincere, kind heart. <br />In terms of physicality I would say I prefer someone taller then myself. I am definitely open to all races, and would be very open to marrying outside of my own race Insha’Allah. <br /><br />*”Would you like your profile to be promoted ?”*<br /><br />*TEXT* <br />07900 247 837<br /><br />One off payment of £10 then your marriage profile would be sent to thousands of people inshallah<br /><br />••• PERSONALISED service also available inshallah •••<br /><br />*FORWARD 4 REWARD !!!*<br /><br />JOIN THESE —-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://t.me/sunnahmarriage">https://t.me/sunnahmarriage</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEe2EKQKszDGCY7ZuQ">https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEe2EKQKszDGCY7ZuQ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />(Na.
