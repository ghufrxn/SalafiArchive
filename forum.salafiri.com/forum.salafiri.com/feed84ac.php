When the man went to put the cheque in his account he added another zero to the cheque totalling it to 15,000.<br /><br />The cashier was unsure why Imaam Ibn Baaz would give such a large amount to this man so he queried it and went to the Shaikh himself.<br /><br />When the Shaikh heard this he remained silent but his lips were moving, after a few seconds he lowered his head and said, “please give him the 15,000 riyals I think he is in need of the money and his desperate situation has led him change the cheque.” <em>(ad-Durrar adh-Dhahabiyyah pg.62-63)</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/2-excerpts-from-the-life-of-imaam-abdul-azeez-ibn-abdullaah-ibn-baaz-helping-the-poor-having-a-big-heart/">https://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2011 ... big-heart/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Dec 08, 2016 9:24 am</p><hr />
