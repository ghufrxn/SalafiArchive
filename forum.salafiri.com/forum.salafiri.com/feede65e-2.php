<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">How To Treat Impotence</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br />A man has been married for twenty years. For the past year he has not been able to have intercourse with his wife. The man lives in Jordan. Naturally within the books of some of the evil people, they prohibit them man from being with his wife (in this state). So he had other people review these books or these barriers which had been set up and when they reviewed it they said: Your affair is a difficult one. So is there anything for him within the Book and the Sunnah? May Allaah reward you with good.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br />It seems as though you are asking about a man who is hindered from enjoying his wife; he cannot have intercourse with her. So is there any cure?<br /><br />The answer is yes, there is a cure. It is by seeking refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and from the evil of that which He has created. Likewise, by reading the two chapters of seeking refuge:<br /><br />قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ<br />Say: “I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of the daybreak (Al-Falaq 113:1)<br /><br />And:<br /><br />قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ<br />Say: “I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of mankind (An-Nas 114:1)<br /><br />Also, by reciting the statement of the Most High:<br />مَا جِئْتُم بِهِ السِّحْرُ إِنَّ اللّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُ إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ<br /><br />“What you have brought is sorcery, Allaah will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allaah does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidûn (the evil-doers, corrupts, etc.). (Yoonus 10:81)<br /><br />This is in Soorah Yoonus.<br /><br />Also, by saying the supplications which have been narrated from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam); such as:<br /><br />أعوذ بكلمات الله التامات من شر ما خلق<br />I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which he has created.<br /><br />And by way of Ruqyah for the ill; the likes of:<br /><br />ربنا الله الذي في السماء تقدس اسمك<br />Our Lord is Allaah who is above the heavens; Sanctified is Your Name…[1] <br /><br />So let him treat himself by way of these supplications and these verses, (doing so) with sincerity. He can read (for himself) or he can be read upon; and Allaah answers supplication.<br /><br /><em>Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts</em><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source: Silsilah Liqaa’aat Al-Baab Al-Maftooh (no. 5)</span></strong><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/how-to-treat-impotence-shaykh-muhammad-ibn-saalih-al-uthaymeen">http://mtws.posthaven.com/how-to-treat- ... -uthaymeen</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Watch Video @ <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yQ">http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yQ</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Footnotes:</span></strong><br /><br />[1] The entirety of the supplication is as follows:<br /><br />ربنا الله الذي في السماء تقدس اسمك ، أمرك في السماء والأرض ، كما رحمتك في السماء ، فاجعل رحمتك في الأرض ، واغفر لنا حوبنا وخطايانا أنت رب الطيبين ، فأنزل رحمة من رحمتك ، وشفاء من شفائك على هذا الوجع فيبرأ <br />Our Lord is Allaah Who is above the heavens; Sanctified is Your Name; Your Command is within the heavens and the earth. Just as Your Mercy is within the heavens place Your mercy in the earth. Forgive us of our sins and mistakes. You are the Lord of the goodly people. Send down mercy from Your Mercy and a cure from Your cure, upon this affliction, so that it is removed. <br /><br /><em>Reported within Al-‘Uloo Lil-‘Alee Al-Ghaffaar by Adh-Dhahabee (no. 231)</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://abdurrahman.org/family/how-to-treat-impotence-shaykh-uthaymeen.html">http://abdurrahman.org/family/how-to-tr ... ymeen.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 11:16 pm</p><hr />
