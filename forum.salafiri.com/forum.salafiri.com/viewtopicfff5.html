			<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">A Hundred Line Poem Recounting the Life of the Most Noble of all Creation</span></strong><br /><em>by ‘Alee ibn ‘Alee ibn Muhammad ibn Abil-‘Izz al-Hanafee</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Aboo Shaybah</em><br /><br />A poem composed by ibn Abil-‘Izz al-Hanafee, author of Sharh al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah. The poem presents a summarized timeline of important events which occurred throughout the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah, Muhammad Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam.<br /><br />[1] All praise is for Allaah, The Eternal, The Maker;<br /><em>followed by His salaah upon the chosen one.</em><br /><br />[2] Here is the Messenger’s biography<br /><em>in poem form with succinct sections.</em><br /><br />[3] His birth was on the tenth of the distinguished month,<br /><em>Rabee‘ al-Awwal, in the year of the elephant.</em><br /><br />[4] However, the common view is that it was the twelfth,<br /><em>on a Monday at the break of dawn,</em><br /><br />[5] corresponding to the twentieth of April.<br /><em>Prior to that, his father passed away.</em><br /><br />[6] Two years later he was weaned<br /><em>and brought back safe and sound by his wetnurse,</em><br /><br />[7] Haleemah, to his mother. She then returned<br /><em>with him to her own family as she had desired.</em><br /><br />[8] Two months later his belly was cleaved open,<br /><em>though some say it was when he was four years old.</em><br /><br />[9] At six years and one month, while returning,<br /><em>his mother passed away at al-Abwaa’.</em><br /><br />[10] And his paternal grandfather, ‘Abdul-Muttalib,<br /><em>passed away while he was eight, no lie.</em><br /><br />[11] Then his paternal uncle, Aboo Taalib, took on<br /><em>his guardianship, and later to ash-Shaam he travelled.</em><br /><br />[12] That was while he was twelve years old<br /><em>and the well-known incident with Baheeraa took place.</em><br /><br />[13] The best of mankind again travelled to ash-Shaam<br /><em>at the age of twenty five - remember it -</em><br /><br />[14] as a trader for our mother, Khadeejah,<br /><em>and he returned that year after profitable trade, happy.</em><br /><br />[15] In that year was his marriage to her,<br /><em>and he later consummated his marriage with her.</em><br /><br />[16] All his children were from her except Ibraaheem.<br /><em>The first to earn that distinction was al-Qaasim.</em><br /><br />[17] Then came Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Faatimah,<br /><em>and Umm Kulthoom, who was the last of the girls;</em><br /><br />[18] and At-Taahir, At-Tayyib, ‘Abdullaah;<br /><em>but some say each name belonged to a separate beautiful child.</em><br /><br />[19] All of them tasted death during his lifetime,<br /><em>except Faatimah who died half-a-year after him.</em><br /><br />[20] At thirty five he participated<br /><em>in rebuilding the House of Allaah after its dilapidation.</em><br /><br />[21] They appointed him to arbitrate and accepted his solution<br /><em>for putting the Black Stone into place.</em><br /><br />[22] At the age of forty he was sent as a Messenger;<br /><em>on a Monday with certainty - so convey it -</em><br /><br />[23] during Ramadaan or Rabee’ al-Awwal,<br /><em>and Soorah “Iqra’ ” was the first of the revelation.</em><br /><br />[24] Then wudoo’ and salaah he was taught<br /><em>by Jibreel, as two complete units of prayer.</em><br /><br />[25] Then, after the passing of twenty full days,<br /><em>enormous, terrifying stars pelted the Jinn.</em><br /><br />[26] Then, in the fourth year, he called<br /><em>openly to Islaam as commanded.</em><br /><br />[27] Four women along with twelve<br /><em>men among the Companions all migrated</em><br /><br />[28] to the lands of Habashah in the fifth year.<br /><em>The same year, they returned, but went back without blame.</em><br /><br />[29] They were eighty three men<br /><em>accompanied by a group completing their total number;</em><br /><br />[30] and they were eighteen women. Later on,<br /><em>in the sixth year, Hamzah - al-Asad - accepted Islaam.</em><br /><br />[31] Nine years after his Messengership<br /><em>came the death of Aboo Taalib, his guardian;</em><br /><br />[32] followed by Khadeejah who passed away<br /><em>after three days had elapsed.</em><br /><br />[33] After fifty and a quarter years, Islaam was embraced<br /><em>by the Jinn of Naseebeen, who then departed - let it be known.</em><br /><br />[34] Thereafter, he married Sawdah<br /><em>in Ramadaan; followed by</em><br /><br />[35] his marriage to the daughter of as-Siddeeq in Shawwaal.<br /><em>At the age of fifty one</em><br /><br />[36] he was taken by night, and the salawaat were obligated;<br /><em>five with the reward of fifty, as authentically preserved.</em><br /><br />[37] The first bay‘ah was with twelve<br /><em>of the people from Taybah, as has been mentioned.</em><br /><br />[38] At the age of fifty two came<br /><em>seventy in the Hajj season - and this is confirmed -</em><br /><br />[39] from Taybah. They pledged allegiance, and he later left<br /><em>Makkah on a Monday in the month Safar.</em><br /><br />[40] Thus, the one contented arrived in Taybah, for certain,<br /><em>having reached the age of fifty three</em><br /><br />[41] on a Monday. He remained there<br /><em>for ten full years as we shall recount.</em><br /><br />[42] In the first year, salaah of a resident was made complete,<br /><em>this was after he prayed Jumu‘ah - listen to my words.</em><br /><br />[43] He then constructed a masjid at Qubaa’,<br /><em>as well as the masjid in the noble city, al-Madeenah.</em><br /><br />[44] Then, around it, he built his dwellings.<br /><em>Later this year arrived</em><br /><br />[45] less than half of those who had travelled<br /><em>to the lands of Habashah when they migrated.</em><br /><br />[46] In the same year, the noblest of all elite established ties of brotherhood<br /><em>between the Muhaajireen and Ansaar.</em><br /><br />[47] He then consummated marriage with the daughter of his best Companion,<br /><em>and legislated the athaan, so follow his example.</em><br /><br />[48] The battle of al-Abwaa’ took place afterwards, in Safar.<br /><em>Subsequently, in the second year, combat spread</em><br /><br />[49] to Buwaat and then Badr. The obligation<br /><em>of redirecting the Qiblah came in the middle of Rajab</em><br /><br />[50] following Thil-‘Ushayr, o my brothers.<br /><em>Fasting for a month was obligated in Sha‘baan,</em><br /><br />[51] and the major clash which was at Badr<br /><em>happened during fasting, on the seventeenth of the month.</em><br /><br />[52] Zakaah al-Fitr was obligated in it<br /><em>following Badr by ten nights.</em><br /><br />[53] There is difference regarding Zakaah al-Maal - you must realize this.<br /><em>The daughter of the righteous Prophet passed away,</em><br /><br />[54] Ruqayyah, prior to the army’s return;<br /><em>she was the wife of ‘Uthmaan. The marriage of the chaste</em><br /><br />[55] Faatimah to the esteemed ‘Alee.<br /><em>And al-‘Abbaas accepted Islaam after being taken captive.</em><br /><br />[56] And as for Qaynuqaa‘, battle with them ensued afterwards.<br /><em>And he sacrificed on the ‘Eed of slaughter.</em><br /><br />[57] And the battle of as-Saweeq, then Qarqarah.<br /><em>And combat in the third year spread further</em><br /><br />[58] to Ghatafaan and Banee Sulaym.<br /><em>Umm Kulthoom, daughter of the noble esteemed,</em><br /><br />[59] was married to ‘Uthmaan and he earned this distinction.<br /><em>And the Prophet later married Hafsah,</em><br /><br />[60] and Zaynab also; then headed to Uhud for battle<br /><em>- in the month of Shawwaal - and Hamraa’ al-Asad.</em><br /><br />[61] Intoxicants were prohibited undoubtedly - so listen -<br /><em>and that year his grandson, al-Hasan, was born.</em><br /><br />[62] In the fourth year, battle reached<br /><em>Banee an-Nadeer in Rabee‘ al-Awwal.</em><br /><br />[63] Then followed the death of Zaynab, the aforementioned,<br /><em>and afterwards, marriage to Umm Salamah,</em><br /><br />[64] and the daughter of Jahsh. Then, to Badr as appointed<br /><em>followed by al-Ahzaab - so listen and keep count -</em><br /><br />[65] then Banee Quraythah, though regarding these two<br /><em>there is difference. And at Thaat ar-Riqaa‘ he taught</em><br /><br />[66] how to pray Salaah al-Khawf; and prayer was shortened, as reported.<br /><em>and the verses about hijaab and tayammum.</em><br /><br />[67] Some said and his stoning of the two Jews,<br /><em>and the birth of his lovely grandson, al-Husayn.</em><br /><br />[68] In the fifth year - listen and trust me - was<br /><em>the slander during the battle of Banee al-Mustaliq.</em><br /><br />[69] Doomah al-Jandal happened before that. And also<br /><em>he wed the daughter of al-Haarith later on, and consummated.</em><br /><br />[70] His marriage to Rayhaanah was in the fifth.<br /><em>Then Banee Lihyaan was at the beginning of the sixth year.</em><br /><br />[71] After that, his istisqaa’ prayer, and Thoo Qarad,<br /><em>and he was obstructed from performing ‘Umrah as he wished.</em><br /><br />[72] Bay‘ah ar-Ridwaan came first, and he consummated<br /><em>that year his marriage with Rayhaanah, as clarified.</em><br /><br />[73] And Hajj was obligated, though with difference - so take heed -<br /><em>and the conquest of Khaybar was in the seventh year.</em><br /><br />[74] The meat of domestic donkeys was prohibited<br /><em>that year, as well as the corrupt Mut‘ah form of marriage.</em><br /><br />[75] He later married Umm Habeebah<br /><em>and her mahr on his behalf an-Najaashee paid.</em><br /><br />[76] A lamb was poisoned and offered as a gift,<br /><em>and he later chose for himself the pure Safiyyah.</em><br /><br />[77] She came, as well as all the remaining migrants.<br /><em>And marriage to Maymoonah was the last.</em><br /><br />[78] Prior to that was the Islaam of Aboo Hurayrah,<br /><em>and after was the famous ‘Umrah al-Qadaa’.</em><br /><br />[79] And the envoys in the sanctified month of Muharram<br /><em>he sent them to the kings - so know this.</em><br /><br />[80] Presented as a gift was Maariyah al-Qibtiyyah<br /><em>that year. Then in the eigth year was a sariyyah</em><br /><br />[81] which headed to Mu’tah. And during fasting<br /><em>the conquest of al-Balad al-Haraam took place.</em><br /><br />[82] After it, they relate what happened during<br /><em>the day at Hunayn, and then the day at at-Taa’if.</em><br /><br />[83] Later, in Thul-Qa‘dah, he performed ‘Umrah<br /><em>from al-Ji‘irraanah, and he was settled.</em><br /><br />[84] His daughter, Zaynab, passed away and then<br /><em>Ibraaheem was born in it, surely.</em><br /><br />[85] And turn was given to ‘Aa’ishah by<br /><em>Sawdah for as long as she remained alive.</em><br /><br />[86] The minbar was made and placed conspicuously,<br /><em>and ‘Attaab led the people in Hajj.</em><br /><br />[87] Then expedition to Tabook was in the ninth year<br /><em>and he demolished Masjid ad-Diraar, removing its harm.</em><br /><br />[88] Aboo Bakr led the people in Hajj, and there<br /><em>‘Alee recited “Baraa’ah” and decisively declared</em><br /><br />[89] that no mushrik would again perform Hajj, and none<br /><em>unclothed would make Tawaaf - they both carried out as instructed.</em><br /><br />[90] Delegations came in plenty, one after the next,<br /><em>and he swore he would not go to his womenfolk for a month.</em><br /><br />[91] He announced the death of an-Najaashee and prayed<br /><em>upon him from Taybah, earning him great virtue.</em><br /><br />[92] Ibraaheem passed away in the final year<br /><em>and al-Bajalee accepted Islaam, and his name was Jareer.</em><br /><br />[93] He performed the Farewell Hajj as a Qaarin<br /><em>and he stopped on a Friday during it in security.</em><br /><br />[94] And revealed that day was a glad tiding for you:<br /><em>This day I have perfected for you your religion.</em><br /><br />[95] Rayhaanah’s death was after his return,<br /><em>and the nine lived on after him.</em><br /><br />[96] And on a Monday he finished - for certain -<br /><em>having completed sixty three.</em><br /><br />[97] He was laid to rest in the dwelling of the daughter of as-Siddeeq<br /><em>at the location of his death, precisely determined.</em><br /><br />[98] The duration of his illness was two-fifths of a month,<br /><em>but some say it was a third and a fifth - know this.</em><br /><br />[99] This concludes the hundred line poem<br /><em>recounting the life of the most noble of all creation.</em><br /><br />[100] May Allaah, my Lord, send salaah upon him, and upon<br /><em>his Companions, his family, and those who follow.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qaryah.wordpress.com/">https://qaryah.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
