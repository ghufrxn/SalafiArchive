They will be wearing shawls.[1]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Disbelievers &amp; Hypocrites</span></strong><br />Anas Ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) also narrated that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:<br /><br />There is no land the Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina. There is not a single path leading to them except that there are angels in rows guarding them.<br /><br />Medina will then be shaken by three earthquakes whereby Allah will remove every disbeliever and hypocrite (from Medina).[2]<br /><br />And in the narration of Imam Ahmad:<br /><br />The Dajjal will come and enter every place on earth except Mecca and Medina. When he comes to Medina, he will find on every path leading to it rows of angels. He will then come to a marsh and camp there. Medina will be shaken by three earthquakes whereby every hypocrite man and hypocrite woman will leave (Medina) and come out to him.[3]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Some of the Deceived Bedouins</span></strong><br />Abu Umamah al-Bāhilī ( رضي الله عنه ) said that Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said about the Dajjal:<br />…And surely from his tribulations is that he will ask a Bedouin, “If I resurrect your father and mother, would you then testify that I am your lord?” He will answer, “Yes.” Two devils will then take the appearance of his father and mother and say to him, “My son, follow him for he is surely your Lord.”[4]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“People with Faces like Hammered Shields”</span></strong><br />Abu Bakr al-al-Ṣiddīq ( رضي الله عنه ) narrated, in a Hadith collected by al-Timidhi and others, that the Prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:<br /><br />The Dajjal will appear from a land in the East said to be called: Khorasan.[5] There will follow him people with faces like hammered shields.[6]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/">http://www.authentic-translations.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Footnotes: <br />[1] Collected by Muslim and Ahmad<br /><br />[2] Collected by al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Ahmad<br /><br />[3] Collected by al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Ahmad, and it is in al-Albani’s Sahih al-Jami’ (no. 8028)<br /><br />[4] Collected by Ibn Majah, al-Hakim, and Ibn Khuzaymah, and it is no. 7875 in al-Albani’s Sahih al-Jami’.<br /><br />[5] Khorasan is “a historical region and realm comprising a vast territory now lying in northeastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, and northern Afghanistan.” Encyclopedia Britannica.<br /><br />[6] Collected by al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad, al-Hakim, and Ibn Majah, and al-Albani said it is authentic in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi (no. 1824).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Feb 15, 2017 12:08 am</p><hr />
