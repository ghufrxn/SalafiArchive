<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">What Is The Ruling On Celebrating The So Called Mother's Day?</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />&quot;May Allāh reward you. The questioner says: &quot;What is the ruling on celebrating the so called Mother's day?&quot;<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />&quot;The celebration is impermissible. The Muslims have only two 'Eids;<br /><ul> - 'Eid Al-Fitr, and<br /> - 'Eid Al-Adhā.</ul><br />​And each 'Eid comes after carrying out a pillar from the (five) pillars of Islām;<br /><br /><ul> - 'Eid Al-Fitr comes after carrying out the pillar of Fasting.<br /> - 'Eid Al-Adhā comes after carrying out the pillar of Hajj.</ul><br />Only these two 'Eids. There are no other 'Eids besides them. Not for the mothers, nor for the fathers, nor... not even for the Messenger ﷺ. Not even for the Messenger ﷺ; there is no 'Eid for his birthday. There is no venture for the birthday of the Messenger ﷺ. This is an innovation! Yes.<br /><br />If not even the birthday of the Messenger ﷺ is to be celebrated, how then can one celebrate the birthday of the (ordinary) human being and the birthday of the walī, or the birthday of whomsoever they venerate, the birthday of the president, the birthday of... this is impermissible! Yes.<br /><br />Whoever wants to do good to his mother then let him be dutiful to her, not by making an 'Eid (festival) for her. This 'Eid does not benefit her. If you want the reward (from Allāh) then be dutiful to your mother during her lifetime and after her death. Yes.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, may Allah preserve him</span></strong><br /><br />Translated by 'Abdurrahīm Ibn Muhammad Al-Hadhramī.<br /><br />View Source, Arabic, Audio &amp; PDF: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafi-dawah.com/what-is-the-ruling-on-celebrating-the-so-called-mothers-day.html">http://www.salafi-dawah.com/what-is-the ... s-day.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2017 2:28 pm</p><hr />
