He (must) feel remorseful for what has happened in the past, while at the same time having firm determination never to return to that (action), also he is to leave that nullifier off in totality. So if his disbelief was by making supplication to the dead and seeking aide or help from the dead or idols, then he is to leave that off and repent to Allah from that, and with this he would have re-entered Islaam. If his disbelief was he denied the obligation of salat then he acknowledges to Allah that he was wrong, and that it is an obligation upon every responsible individual, and he seeks Allah’s forgiveness from that feels regretful and abstains (from that action) and has firm determination never to return to it, then Allah will forgive him. Or perhaps he used to abandon the prayer, then repentance is that he performs the prayer and is remorseful about what has happened, seeks forgiveness for what has already taken place, and has firm determination never to return to that. Likewise if his disbelief was he said that fornication is permissible if he repents (by) him saying,” No, this is prohibited, and I repent to Allah and I have erred.” And Allah knows from his heart that he is truthful and will pardon and forgive him.
