And if he passed by an Ayaah which mention the Hell-Fire he would stop, supplicate and seek Allaah’s forgiveness.’<br /><br /><em>[‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />7 – From Nafa’ who said:<br /><br />‘Ibn Umar never ever read these two Ayaat from the last part of Soorah Baqarah except that he would cry:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;وَإِن تُبۡدُواْ مَا فِيٓ أَنفُسِكُمۡ أَوۡ تُخۡفُوهُ يُحَاسِبۡكُم بِهِ ٱللَّهُۖ&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. &gt;&gt; then he would say: ‘Indeed this is a severe level of accountability.’<br /><br /><em>[al-Hileeyah]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />8 – From Ibn Mas’ood –Radi Allaahu anhu– who said:<br /><br />‘Be continuous in looking into the Mus’haf (the Qur’aan).’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />9 – From Yunus bin Jubayr who said:<br /><br />‘Jundub accompanied us until we reached the edge of the town and we said, advise us.’<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />‘I advise you to have fear of Allaah and I advise you with the Qur’aan, since it is light on a dark night, and the brightness of the day.’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Taken From: ‘Min Ahkbar as-Salaf’ p.100]</span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/some-narrations-regarding-reading-the-quraan-reflecting-upon-it/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... g-upon-it/</a><!-- m --></div>
