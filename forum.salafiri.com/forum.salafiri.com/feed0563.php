<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=1387&amp;p=1471#p1471"><![CDATA[
Introduction <br />The group known as the Bareilawis is known to many of us <br />especially those of us from the sub continent. Whether it is <br />family members or friends we know some people who ascribe to <br />this group and follow its teachings. So who are Bareilawis and <br />what do they believe? <br /><br />The Origin of the Word <br />The word Bareilawi comes from their founder whose name was <br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi born in Bareilly, a City in India <br />in the province of Uttar Pradesh. Hence, he named him self al- <br />Bareilawi (the Bareilawi) after the city he was born in. He was <br />born on 10 Shawwal 1272 which corresponds to 14 June 1865 CE. <br />Although the name given to him was Muhammad, he would refer to <br />himself in many of his works as Abdul Mustafa (Slave of al- <br />Mustafa - a name of the Prophet sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), <br />such a name obviously is not allowed. However, this was not his <br />only expression of shirk as you will find out in this article. <br /><br />Their History <br />Ahmad Rida founded the sect of the Bareilawis and it resides <br />mainly in the sub continent. This does not mean that similar <br />beliefs do not exist outside the sub continent though many of <br />those people would not have heard of the Bareilawis. The <br />beleifs and practices that Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi <br />brought, such as calling upon the dead, were not necessarily <br />new. People before him had practiced them, but he revived these <br />innovated beliefs with much vigour. The majority of Bareilawis <br />still reside in India and Pakistan though many are found <br />throughout the world such as in England where they have large <br />gatherings and sessions of weird and innovated practices. <br /><br />The Beliefs and Practices of the Barelawis The Bareilawis have <br />their own peculiar beliefs and doctrines, distinguished from <br />other factions of the Indian sub continent. Sometimes their <br />beliefs resemble the Shiah beliefs and doctrines, such as their <br />reverence and worship of saints and pious men. They have many <br />un-Islaamic beliefs, which are too numerous to mention here, we <br />will however highlight the most prominent of their beliefs. <br /><br />1. Seeking Help from Other Than Allaah <br /><br />The Bareilawis call upon other than Allaah in times of need, <br />this is clear in their books, <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said: <br /><br />&quot;There are servants of Allaah whom He has singled for <br />fulfilling the needs of the people who flee to them with their <br />needs.&quot; [Al Amn Wal Ula of Ahmad Rida al-Bareilawi p29] <br /><br />And he also said: <br /><br />&quot;Seeking help and aid from anyone besides Allaah is lawful and <br />desired. No one denies it except an arrogant and obstinate.&quot; <br />[Hayat al Mawat By Ahmad Rida al-Bareilawi; included in al <br />Fataawa ar-Ridwiyya (Pakistan Edition) Vol 4, p 300.] <br /><br />And he also says in Al Amn Wal Ula p10: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah is the remover of the calamity and <br />bestower of the donation.&quot; <br /><br />And he also says in Malfuzat p 99: <br /><br />&quot;Jibreel is the supplier of the needs, and the Messenger of <br />Allaah is the supplier of the needs, for the Prophet fulfils <br />the needs of Jibreel too.&quot; <br /><br />And he also said the following words of Kufr in Malfuzat p 307: <br /><br />&quot;During my life I did not seek help from anyone, and I do not <br />ask for aid except Shaykh Abdul Qaadir, whenever I seek help I <br />seek it only from him; whenever I ask for aid, I ask him alone. <br />Once I tried to ask for aid and seek help from another saint, <br />(hadhrat Mahbub Ilahi). When I intended to utter his name for <br />seeking help, I did not utter the words but 'Ya Ghauthan' (O <br />one whose help is sought). My tongue refused to utter the words <br />for seeking help from anyone except him.&quot; <br /><br />and Ahmad Rida Khaan also said in Al Amn wal Ula p44: <br /><br />&quot;When you are confused and helpless in matters, then seek help <br />from the inmates of the graves.&quot; <br /><br />All this is refuted by Islaam we say many times in our prayer: <br /><br />&quot;You alone do we worship and You alone do we ask for help.&quot; <br />[1:5] <br /><br />Allaah, the Exalted, said disapproving of the statements of the <br />polytheists and their acts, and reprimanding them: <br /><br />&quot;Say: (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) 'Call upon <br />those whom you assert (to be associate gods) besides Allaah, <br />they possess not even the weight of an atom (or a small ant), <br />either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share <br />in either, nor there is for Him any supporter from among <br />them.'&quot; [34:22] <br /><br />Allaah, the Glorified and Exalted, said: <br /><br />&quot;Such is Allaah your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom <br />you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer <br />(the thin membrane over the dateÂ­stone). If you invoke (or call <br />upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were <br />to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on <br />the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping <br />them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe <br />wa sallam) like Him Who is the All Knower (of each and <br />everything).&quot; [35:13-14] <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said to his cousin <br />Ibn Abbaas (radi-Allaahu 'anhumaa): <br /><br />&quot;When you ask, then ask Allaah, and when you seek help seek <br />help from Allaah.&quot; [Hasan Saheeh. Reported by At-Tirmidhee] <br /><br />2. Knowing the Unseen <br /><br />The Bareilawis believe that the Prophets, the Messengers of <br />Allaah and the righteous slaves and saints know the unseen: <br /><br />In ad-Dawlaat al-Makiyya p 58 of Ahmad Rida Khaan it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Prophets know, rather they see and watch over all that <br />which happened and all that which will happen from the first <br />day to the last.&quot; <br /><br />In the book of Ahmad Yaar, Mawa'iz Naimiya p 192 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Prophets know the unseen from their birth.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said in Khalis al Itiqaad p 38: <br /><br />&quot;The Knowldege of the guarded tablet, the knowledge of the pen, <br />and the knowledge of whatever existed and of whatever will <br />exist are part of the knowledge of the Prophet.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi also said in Mawa'iz Naimiyya p <br />364-365: <br /><br />&quot;If the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) places his foot <br />on an animal, it will have knowledge of the seen and the <br />unseen. How does a saint on whom the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) put his hand, not know the seen and <br />the unseen.&quot; <br /><br />All this kufr is again refuted by the Qur'aan and the Sunnah: <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'None in the <br />heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (unseen) except Allaah, <br />nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.' &quot; [27:65] <br /><br />&quot;And they say: 'How is it that not a sign is sent down on him <br />from his Lord?' Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam): 'The unseen belongs to Allaah Alone, so wait you, <br />verily I am with you among those who wait (for Allaah's <br />Judgement).' &quot; [10:20] <br /><br />The Messenger (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) once heard a <br />young girl say: <br /><br />&quot;Amongst us is a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow.&quot; <br /><br />So he (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said to her: <br /><br />&quot;Leave this and return to that which you were saying before.&quot; <br />[Bukhaaree] <br /><br />3. That the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is not <br />Human and was Created from Light <br /><br />It is written in Mawa'iz Naimiyya p14 by Ahmad Yaar (a leading <br />figure of the Bareilawis): <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah is light from the divine light, and <br />all the creatures are from his light.&quot; <br /><br />In al-Fatwaawa Naimiyya p 37 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;Allaah created the image of Muhammad from the light of his <br />names Al-Badee (The Originator), Al-Qaadir (The All Powerful), <br />and looked at it with his Name Al-Qaahir (The Irresistible). <br />Then He (Allaah) became manifest to him (the Prophet Sall <br />Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) with His names Al-Lateef (The <br />Subtle), Al-Ghaafir (The Most Gracious, The Most Forgiving)&quot; <br /><br />Islaam again rejects this belief, Allaah (subhaanahu wa <br />ta'alaa) mentions that what kept man from believing was the <br />fact that the Prophets and Messengers were human, as He <br />(subhaanahu wa ta'alaa) says: <br /><br />&quot;And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance <br />came to them, except that they said: 'Has Allaah sent a man as <br />(His) Messenger?' &quot; [17:94] <br /><br />Allaah then rejects this by saying: <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'If there were <br />on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We <br />should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an <br />angel as a Messenger.' &quot; [17:95] <br /><br />Allaah the Glorified and Exalted ordered His Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'I am only a <br />man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilaah (God) <br />is One Ilaah (God i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the <br />Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate <br />none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.' &quot; [18:110] <br /><br />The whole life of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />bears witness to him being a human, he ate, drank, relieved <br />himself, married, had children. And we say that he was the <br />greatest of mankind due to his status and rank as the Chief of <br />the Messengers. <br /><br />4. The Belief the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is <br />Ever Present and Ever Watchful (Haadhir wal Naazir) <br /><br />This is one of the main beliefs of the Bareilawis, this belief <br />is that the Prophet (Sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) is present <br />at every place and sees everything. This leads them to leave <br />spaces in their innovated gatherings believing that he (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) comes and sits in those gatherings. <br /><br />It is written in Taskin al-Khawatir fi Masalat al-Haadhir wal- <br />Naazir, that Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said: <br /><br />&quot;There is no place and there is no time in which the Messenger <br />of Allaah is not present.&quot; <br /><br />In Ja'al Haqq of Ahmad Yaar p 150 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah has power to travel throughout the <br />world with the spirits of the companions, and many saints have <br />seen him.&quot; <br /><br />In Khaalis al-Itiqaad p40 it is written: <br /><br />&quot;The Spirit of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) is <br />present in the homes of the people of Islaam.&quot; <br /><br />This evil belief is totally refuted by Islaam, Allaah says <br />addressing His Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) whilst <br />mentioning the events of Moosaa (alayhis-salaam): <br /><br />&quot;And you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) were not on <br />the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Moosaa <br />(Moses) the commandment, and you were not among those present.&quot; <br />[28:44] <br /><br />He (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) also says: <br /><br />&quot;Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) Who took His slave <br />(Muhammad Sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) for a journey by night <br />from Al-Masjid-al-Haraam (at Makkah) to the farthest mosque (in <br />Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order <br />that We might show him (Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />of Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, <br />He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&quot; [17:1] <br /><br />This means that he, the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />would enter where he (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) was not <br />present at that time. <br /><br />Shaykh Hasan ibn Mansoor al-Ma`roof Biqaadeekhaan (d.592H) <br />writes, <br /><br />&quot;A man did nikaah with a woman without any witnesses and at the <br />time of the nikaah he said to the woman &quot;We make Allaah and his <br />Messenger our witnesses.&quot; The fuqahaa (Islaamic jurisprudents) <br />have said that this statement of the man is disbelief (kufr), <br />because he held the belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen <br />whereas he didn't have the knowledge of the unseen when he was <br />alive so how would he then have it after his death.&quot; [Fatawaa <br />Qaadee Khaan (p. 883)] <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Abdur-Rasheed Abul-Fattaah Zaheerud-Deen al- <br />Lululghee (d.540H) writes, <br /><br />&quot;A man without witnesses married a woman (and the witnesses <br />were not present). Addressing the woman he said &quot;I am doing <br />nikaah with you whilst making Allaah and his Messenger (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) my witnesses,&quot; then that individual <br />will become a kaafir (disbeliever), because he came to the <br />belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) has the knowledge of the unseen, because the one who <br />doesn't have knowledge then how can he become a witness. The <br />person who has this aqeedah that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen and <br />he is present and with us then he is a kaafir.&quot; [Fataawaa Walu <br />al-Jeeyah wa Kadha Beeree Haashiyah Ishbah] <br /><br />Shaykh Aboo Haneefah at-Thasnee Zaynul-Aabideen Ibn Najeem al- <br />Misree (d.970H) says, <br /><br />&quot;If anyone takes Allaah and Muhammad (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) as witnesses for nikaah then from the start, that <br />person will become a kaafir because he held the belief that the <br />Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) knows the <br />knowledge of the unseen.&quot; [Bahrur-Raqiaq (5/16)] <br /><br />Sultaan Aalamgeer (d.1118), the Islamic Constitution, Law and <br />Principles which he set out in India with the help of five <br />hundred fuqahaa. In it, it has the explanation, &quot;That a man did <br />nikaah without any witnesses and he said &quot;I make Allaah and his <br />Messenger (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) my witnesses,&quot; or he <br />says &quot;I make Allaah's Messenger my witness,&quot; or he says &quot;I make <br />Allaah and his Angels my witnesses.&quot; then such an individual <br />will become a kaafir. If he says I make the Angels on my right <br />and left sides (kiraaman-kaatibeen) as my witnesses then he <br />will not be a kaafir (Because both these Angels are present <br />with us but the nikaah (marriage) will be invalid.&quot; [Fataawaa <br />Alamgeer (2/412)] <br /><br />In the famous and well-known Hanafee Fiqh book Fataawaa <br />Tataarkhaniyyah it is written, <br /><br />&quot;The one who makes Allaah and his Messenger (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) as witnesses for nikaah, then his <br />nikaah will be invalid and the individual will become a kaafir <br />because he held the belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen.&quot; <br /><br />It is written in the well-known Fataawaa Jawahir Ikhlaaqiyyah, <br /><br />&quot;That if someone understood that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the unseen then <br />he becomes a kaafir and if this âaqeedah is held about <br />someone else, then how can the individual remain a Muslim?&quot; <br /><br />Imaam Abee Ibn Abee Bakr (d.593H), the author of Hidaayah in <br />his book Tajnees (p. 297). <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Taahir Ibn Ahmad (d.542H) in Khulaasatul-Fataawaa <br />(4/354). <br /><br />Imaam Abdur-Rahmaan (d.561H) in Fusool Eemadiyyah (p. 64). <br /><br />Imaam Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Khawarzamee al-Mashoor Bil-Bazaazee <br />(d.827H) in Fataawaa Bazzaziyyah (p. 325). <br /><br />Al-Muhaddith al-Allaamah Badrud Deen al-Aynee (d.855H) in <br />Umdatul-Qaaree (11/520). <br /><br />Al-Haafidh Ibnul-Hammaam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Waahid (d.861H) in <br />Masaayarah M'a al-Masamarah (2/88) printed in Egypt. <br /><br />Al-Muhaddith Alee Ibn Sultaan, commonly known as Mullaa Alee <br />Qaaree (d.1014H) in Sharh Fiqhul-Akbar (p. 185). <br /><br />Al-Allaamah Ibn Aabideen al-Hanafee (d.970H) in Shaamee (2/306). <br /><br />Thanaa ullaah Pani Patee (d.1225H) in Maalaa ba'd Mun (p.176) <br />and other Hanafee Fuqahaa have clarified that, The individual <br />who holds the aqeedah that the Messenger of Allaah (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had the knowledge of the <br />unseen or he was present with us then he commits an act of <br />disbelief (kufr). <br /><br /><br /><br />5. Evil Practices at the Grave <br /><br />The Bareilawis have many evil practices at the graves such as <br />prostration to it or near it, making tawaaf of the graves, and <br />putting candles and lamps on the graves, raising them high. <br /><br />It is written in Ja'al Haqq p 300 of Ahmad Yaar: <br /><br />&quot;To light the lamps and candles at the graves of the saints, <br />righteous people and the learned is to exalt the saints. The <br />purpose lying behind it is a good one. The offering of oil and <br />candle to the saints kindled at their graves for their <br />exaltation and out of their love is lawful. It is not proper to <br />prohibit them from this practice.&quot; <br /><br />It is mentioned in a hadeeth reported by Muslim that: <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />prohibited the plastering of graves, sitting upon them and <br />building over them.&quot; <br /><br />In the book called Bahari Shariat it is written: <br /><br />&quot;There is no harm if a person circumambulates (makes tawaaf) <br />around the grave to attain blessings.&quot; <br /><br />Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) clearly states in the Qur'aan <br />that we can only make tawaaf of the Ka'bah: <br /><br />&quot;And make Tawaaf around the Ancient House.&quot; [22:29] <br /><br />6. The Celebration of Birth and Death Anniversaries <br /><br />The Bareilawis celebrate the anniversaries of the death of <br />saints and righteous men. These are held at their graves. <br /><br />One of the disciples of Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi wrote in the <br />book Bahari Shariat (Vol 1): <br /><br />&quot;The celebration of the death anniversary of the saints, <br />recitation of the Qur'aan, al-Faatihah, preaching, and shifting <br />reward to them are the cause of blessings, for the saints are <br />alive in their graves, and the faculties of their knowledge, <br />perception, hearing and seeing have increased.&quot; <br /><br />One of their scholars issued a fatwa: <br /><br />&quot;The Prayer is lawful only behind a person who celebrates the <br />death anniversaries and recites al-Faatihah. As regards those <br />who are opposed to these things, prayer behind them is not <br />lawful.&quot; [Al-Haqq Al-Mubin p74 by Al-Kazimi] <br /><br />They also celebrate the birthday of the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), which is an innovation and was <br />never practiced by him (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) or by <br />any of his Companions. They decorate their gatherings and <br />houses and believe that only those who celebrate this day will <br />attain salvation. <br /><br />In Ja'al Haqq of Ahmad Yaar it says: <br /><br />&quot;To celebrate a festival, to hold gatherings, to rejoice and to <br />distribute sweets on the anniversary of the Prophet's birthday <br />are commendable and the cause of the coming down of the <br />Blessings and Mercy of Allaah. The Christians celebrate <br />festivals on Sunday, the day when a table of food came down to <br />them from Heaven. Why should we not celebrate on the day, which <br />is more excellent than that?&quot; <br /><br />The religion of Allaah (subhaanah wa ta'aala) was completed in <br />the lifetime of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) as <br />He (subhaanah wa ta'aala) says: <br /><br />&quot;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My <br />Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your <br />religion.&quot; [5:3] <br /><br />There was no celebration of any birthdays or death <br />anniversaries during the time of the Prophet (sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam). Islaam rejects all of these <br />celebrations. <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said: <br /><br />&quot;Whoever innovates in this affair of ours something which does <br />not belong in it will have it rejected&quot; [Bukhaaree and Muslim] <br /><br />If the celebration of the Prophet's (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) birthday had been something good then definitely the <br />Companions, those who loved him (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) <br />the most, would have done it and told others to do it. However, <br />this is not the case, so we have no right to do what they did <br />not do. <br /><br />7. The Evil Belief Allaah is Everywhere <br /><br />Like other Sufi sects, the Bareilawis believe that Allaah is <br />everywhere in His Essence, as we explained in the last <br />newsletter this belief is false and goes against the teaching <br />of Islaam. <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said in the famous <br />hadeeth of the slave girl: <br /><br />&quot;Where is Allaah?&quot; She replied, &quot;Above the Heavens.&quot; He sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam said, &quot;And who am I?&quot; She <br />replied, &quot;You are the Messenger of Allaah.&quot; He sal- <br />Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam said, &quot;Free her for verily she is a <br />believer.&quot; [Saheeh Muslim] <br /><br />8. Bareilawis and their Takfeer of the Muslims who Oppose them <br /><br />The Bareilawis are very stubborn in their beliefs, whenever <br />someone opposes what they do and shows its falsehood and how it <br />is Shirk they immediately label them as 'Wahaabi' apostates. <br />This reference to wahaabi is a twisting of one of the <br />attributes of Allaah Al-Wahaab (The All Giver) and hence is not <br />permissible. They call Muslims who oppose them this after the <br />great Scholar Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahaab who <br />fought against their beliefs and called to Tawheed (worshipping <br />Allaah alone).The Bareilawis call themselves 'Sunnis' or Ahlus- <br />Sunnah wal-Jammaah and they are far from that, for they do not <br />follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa <br />sallam) nor do they adhere to the people of truth. <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi said in Ahkaam ash-Sharih Vol 1 <br />p123-124: <br /><br />&quot;The Most wicked of the apostates are the Wahaabis.&quot; and, <br /><br />&quot;The Wahaabis are more wicked, harmful and impure than the Jews <br />and the Christians.&quot; <br /><br />Rida Khaan said: &quot;If anyone admires Darul Ulum Deoband, or does <br />not believe in the corruption of the Deobandi's and does not <br />scorn them, then this is sufficient to make a judgment for him <br />to be a Non-Muslim!&quot; (Fatawa Ridwiyya, 6/43 of Rida Khaan). <br /><br />Rida Khaan in his Malfuzat (pp. 325-6) said: &quot; If there is a <br />gathering of Hindus, Christians, Qadiyanis and Deobandis, then <br />Deobandis alone should be rejected, for they have come out of <br />the fold of Islam and defected from it. Agreement with the <br />unbelievers is far better than the agreement with the <br />apostates!&quot; <br /><br /><br />&quot;The works of the Deobandis are more unclean than the various <br />works of the Hindus. The doubt about the heresy of Ashraf Ali <br />Deobandi and suspicion about the punishment is also unbelief. <br />To cleanse the impurity with the papers of the works produced <br />by the Deobandis is not lawful, not because of the respect for <br />their books, but because of the reverance of the letters with <br />which they have been written.&quot; (Fatawa Ridwiyya, 2/136, <br />Faisalabad, Pakistan). <br /><br /><br />9. Deviated Ascription of Power to the Prophets and Saints <br /><br />The Bareilawis allege that the Power of Allaah, His Sovereignty <br />and His Authority has shifted to the Prophets and Saints. <br /><br />The son of Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi says in al-Istimdad <br />ala ajyal al-Irtidad p 32-33: <br /><br />&quot;Whatever appears in the universe, our chief Muhammad grants <br />it, in whose hands lie all the keys. Therefore, nothing goes <br />out from the divine treasures but at his hands. Whenever he <br />intends to do an act, nothing occurs against it and nothing in <br />the universe can hinder it.&quot; <br /><br />Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi says in al-Istimdad ala ajyal al- <br />Irtidad p 32-33: <br /><br />&quot;It is the Messenger of Allaah who heals up the diseases and <br />pains, removes every calamity from the Muslims, he gives life <br />and resolves the dilemmas, benefits all the creatures, and <br />raises their degrees. He is the guardian, the helper, and the <br />remover of adversity. It is he who cooled down the fire of <br />Ibraaheem. It is he who donates and bestows, and his command is <br />in force and his order is operative in the universe.&quot; <br /><br />What Shirk and Kufr this is! Glory be to Allaah who is far <br />removed from having any equal, the Lord of the Heavens and the <br />Universe, Who said: <br /><br />&quot;And so many a moving (living) creature there is, that carries <br />not its own provision! Allaah provides for it and for you. And <br />He is the All-Hearer, the AllÂ­Knower.&quot; [29:60] <br /><br />&quot;Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to <br />do all things.&quot; [62:1] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'In Whose Hand <br />is the sovereignty of everything (i.e. treasures of each and <br />everything)? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is <br />no protector, if you know.' &quot; [23:88] <br /><br />&quot;And no (moving) living creature is there on earth but its <br />provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place <br />and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.) all is in a Clear <br />Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfooz - the Book of Decrees with Allaah).&quot; <br />[11:6] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'Verily, my <br />Lord enlarges and restricts the provision to whom He pleases, <br />but most men know not.' &quot; [34:36] <br /><br />&quot;Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): 'O Allaah <br />Possessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You <br />will, and You take the kingdom from whom You will, and You <br />endue with honour whom You will, and You humiliate whom You <br />will. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all <br />things.' &quot; [3:26] <br /><br />The Prophet (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said: <br /><br />&quot;Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians exaggerated <br />in praising the son of Maryam (Eesaa alayhis-salaam), for <br />verily, I am only a slave, so say the slave of Allaah and His <br />Messenger.&quot; [Bukhaaree] <br /><br />Misconceptions Cleared <br />Some people might say this is only the belief of the leaders of <br />the Bareilawis and not the beleifs of the followers today. This <br />is false, as is witnessed by anyone who has visited Pakistan, <br />India or Kashmir. They will have witnessed the Shirk that goes <br />on at the graves and the belief these people still hold. They <br />love and revere Ahmad Rida Khaan al-Bareilawi, take from his <br />books and refer to him, indeed they still adhere to his beleifs <br />and practices. <br /><br />Some people might say that you are making takfeer (declaring as <br />non-Muslims) all the Bareilawis. This is not true. We can not <br />say that every single Bareilawi is a Kaafir. Rather we say that <br />these beliefs of theirs are clear Kufr. Whoever adopts these <br />beliefs of kufr, after the proof has been correctly established <br />upon them, then they fall into disbelief. The people of <br />Knowledge can then give a ruling concerning individuals. <br /><br />Conclusion <br />So we have looked at some of the false and wicked beliefs of <br />these people. Their beliefs are closely linked with the Shiah <br />and it is difficult to know who copied whom in their beliefs. <br />Any Muslim who is reading this will realise that these people <br />must be warned against, so we give the following advice: <br /><br />1. To Bareilawis: Leave your innovated beliefs and practices <br />which have no foundation in Islaam and come to that which will <br />give you life, the Qur'aan and Sunnah as understood by the <br />Companions. Accept the truth before death overcomes you. Put <br />your emotions to one side and analyse your beliefs in light of <br />the evidences from authentic sources. <br /><br />2. To the people of 'unity at all costs' who find no problem co- <br />operating with Sufis like the Bareilawis: We advice you to <br />return to the way of the Companions in dealing with people who <br />transgress the limits laid down by Allaah. You claim to be upon <br />the truth yet you do not defend it. You claim to love the truth <br />yet you do not defend its people. You claim to be sincere yet <br />you do not search for the truth. You claim to take from the <br />scholars yet you do not sit with them. You claim to be <br />followers of the Salaf us-Saalih (righteous predecessors) yet <br />you do not pay heed to their advice. <br /><br />We ask Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta'alaa) to guide us all to the <br />truth and to expose the people of falsehood wherever they are. <br />Ameen<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2024">Abu Shaqran Zahiri</a> â Thu Mar 30, 2017 12:00 am</p><hr />
