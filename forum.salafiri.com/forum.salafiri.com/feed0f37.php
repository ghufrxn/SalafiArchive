<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">What to recite on a Sick Person</span></strong><br /><em>Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Seeking refuge in Allaah from Shaaytan<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">a) Reciting Soorah Fatiha and repeating it as much as possible as a form of Ruqqiyah.</span></strong><br /><br />From Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri –Radi Allaahu anhu: ‘A group of the companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of the people of the tribe went to the Companions and said:<br /><br />‘Do you have any medicine with you or someone who can recite upon him?’<br /><br />One of them replied: ‘But you did not receive us as your guests. We will not treat your patient with a Ruqqiyah till you fix for us something as wages.’<br /><br />Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The Companion began reciting Soorah Fatiha and spat spittle on the bite till the patient was healed.<br /><br />When the tribe people gave them sheep.<br /><br />The Companions then said, ‘Let’s not take from these sheep till we ask the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and they asked him, the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- laughed and said:<br /><br />‘How did you know that Soorah Fatiha is a Ruqqiyah? Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.’<br /><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhari from the ‘Chapter: Ruqqiyah with the Qur’aan and the Mu’auwidhat’ &amp; Fath al-Bari volume 10 p.195]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">b) Recite Soorah Falaq Soorah Naas and Soorah Ikhlaas</span></strong><br /><br />c) For an illness and before sleeping the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would cup his hands and recite Soorah Ikhlaas, recite Soorah Falaq and Soorah Naas then wipe his hands on his face and all over his body.<br /><br />From Ayesha –Radi Allaahu anha– that ‘the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, during his fatal ailment used to blow (on his hands and pass them) over his body while reciting the Mu’auwidhat (Soorah an-Nas and Soorah al-Falaq).<br /><br />When his disease became aggravated, I used to recite them for him and blow (on his hands) and let him pass his hands over his body because of its blessing.’<br /><br />Ma’mar asked az-Zuhri: ‘How did he use to do Nafth (blow in his hands)?<br /><br />He said: He used to blow on his hands and then pass them over his face.’<br /><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhari from the ‘Chapter: Ruqqiyah with the Qur’aan and the Mu’auwidhat’ &amp; Fath al-Bari volume 10 p.195]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/what-to-recite-on-a-sick-person/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ck-person/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 02, 2017 9:57 pm</p><hr />
