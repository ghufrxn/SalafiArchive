				<div class="content">From an appendix in the publication “UPRIGHT MORAL CHARACTER: A Concise Guide to Attaining Dignified Islaamic Character” by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have Mercy on him):<br /><br />…The shaykh (may Allaah have Mercy on him) would not be pleased when people gave him special privileges due to his status.<br /><br />Once, he was late for a charity engagement in Buraydah, and his driver was driving fast on the highway to get him there on time. On the way, their car was stopped at a police checkpoint. When the officer saw the shaykh in the car, he told them to proceed.<br /><br />As they moved on, the shaykh asked the driver why they were stopped. The driver explained that he had been driving over the speed limit.<br /><br /><em>“Go back to the checkpoint,”</em> he ordered. When they returned to the checkpoint, the shaykh asked the officer why he had stopped them.<br /><br /><em>“For speeding,”</em> the officer replied.<br /><br /><em>“So then why did you let us go?”</em> the shaykh asked.<br /><br /><em>“You were likely in a hurry and had something important to attend to.”</em><br /><br /><em>“No!”</em> said the shaykh, <em>“How much is a speeding ticket?”</em><br /><br /><em>“Shaykh, there is no need…”</em><br /><br /><em>“How much is a speeding ticket?”</em> the shaykh insisted.<br /><br /><em>“Three hundred.”</em><br /><br />The shaykh then handed the officer 150 riyals, and ordered him to take another 150 from the driver, and said, <em>“Because he broke the law and I did not advise him,”</em> and he insisted that the fine be paid!<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2012/06/23/shaykh-ibn-uthaymeen-and-the-speeding-ticket/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2012/06/23/s ... ng-ticket/</a><!-- m --></div>
