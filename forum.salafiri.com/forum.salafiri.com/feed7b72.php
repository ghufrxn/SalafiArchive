<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Salaam ibn Sulaimaan al-Muzani</span></strong><br /><br />Hammaad ibn Zaid said, “I visited Salaam Abul-Mundhir while he was going through the agonies of death. So someone started to remind him to say, ‘Laa ilaaha illallaah.’ But he didn’t say it and that grieved me. Then themuadhin started to pronounce the call to prayer on the minarets of theJaami’ Mosque, saying, ‘Ashhadu an Laa ilaaha illallaah!’ So Salaam said, ‘I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, nothing except what He wills takes place in the Heavens or the earth!’<br /><br />Then he passed away, may Allaah have mercy on him.”<br />Zuhd of Imaam Ahmad, p. 369.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Aamir ibn Abdullaah ibn az-Zubair</span></strong><br /><br />Az-Zubair said, “My uncle, Mus’ab said, ‘Aamir ibn Abdullaah az-Zubair heard the muadhin [making the call to prayer] whilst he was on his deathbed, and his house was close to the mosque. So he said, ‘Take me by my hand.’ So it was said to him, ‘You are ill.’ So he said, ‘I hear the Caller of Allaah [i.e., the muadhin] and I don’t respond?!’ So they took him by the hand and he entered [the mosque] while they were praying maghrib. He prayed a rak’ah with the Imaam and then passed away. May Allaah have mercy on him.’”<br />At-Tamheed, Ibn Abdul-Barr, (20/93).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ibrahim ibn Haani</span></strong><br /><br />Abu Zakariyyaa ibn Ziyaad said, “I was present at the death of Ibrahim ibn Haani.
