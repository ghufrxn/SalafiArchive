And this is during the greatest intercession when the creation will go to Adam for him to intercede on their behalf, then they will go to Nuh, then to Ibrahim, then to Musa, and then to Jesus. All of them will make an excuse and defer the responsibility. Until they go to the best of mankind for him to intercede on their behalf; in order for Allah to show them mercy and relief from the horrors and terrors of the standing on the Day of Judgment. So he will seek permission to intercede with his Lord and he will be granted permission. And he will assume the station of praise and he will be envied by the first of creation and the last of them. And all of creation will be in gratitude towards him.<br /><br />May the blessings and peace of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad<br /><br /><em>Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/everyone-will-know-muhammad-is-the-best-of-mankind">http://mtws.posthaven.com/everyone-will ... of-mankind</a><!-- m --></div>
