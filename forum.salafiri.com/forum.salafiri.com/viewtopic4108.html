				<div class="content">(10)A Note of Clarity Concerning al-Maghrib, al-Kauthar, Current Day Institutes, Academies, Zaheer Mahmood: as-Suffa and others Who Are Unclear, Who Say “but they have some good points aswell.”<br /><br />Al-’Allāmah Shaykh Sālih al-Fawzān (hafidhahullāh) was asked, after being asked about groups {that oppose the salaf}:”O Shaykh! Shall we warn against them without mentioning their good points for example? or do we mention both their good and bad points?”<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />“If you mention their good points it is as if you are calling to them, so no! Do not mention their good points just mention their mistakes because you have not been entrusted to study their circumstances and support their personalities. You have been entrusted to clarify their errors in order for them to repent and in order to warn against them. As for mentioning their good points then the people will then say “this is what we want to take.” (Extracted from Muqaddimah an-Nasr il-’Azeez, pg.8 transmitted from the cassette of the third lesson of Kitāb ut-Tawhīd which was given by the noble Shaykh in Summer 1413 AH/1992 CE in Tā’if.)<br /><br />The above saying needs no commentary from us and is as clear as the sun for the one who wishes to see.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not-">http://www.salafiri.com/risalah-do-not-</a><!-- m --> ... tafarraqu/</div>
