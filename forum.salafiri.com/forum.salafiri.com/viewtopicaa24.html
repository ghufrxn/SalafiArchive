				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh Dr. Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</span></strong><br /><br /><em>This is how you always find the people of falsehood. You find that even if they are arguing and differing amongst themselves, they are in agreement to fight the Sunnah and the people of the Sunnah. This has been the case in the past, the present, and up until today. You find the people of falsehood differing and arguing. They may even declare each other disbelievers. However, if they find some type of wisdom or some type of general benefit for all of them in agreeing to war with the adherents of the Sunnah, they come together in agreement, and they feign forgetfulness of the enmity between themselves. And [their behavior] today is similar to yesterday.</em><br /><br />__________<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source [Arabic]:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://embodyislam.org/2015/03/20/different-methodologies-amongst-themselves-united-against-ahlus-sunnah/">http://embodyislam.org/2015/03/20/diffe ... us-sunnah/</a><!-- m --></div>
