Furthermore the standard is that there is no harm in abusing or cursing Yazeed all in the name of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and so in this is a definite sign of loving Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) and the Ahlul Bayt is cursing and abusing Yazeed (Rahimahullah).<br /><br />However these Soofee Bareilwee Hanafees doing this on their tv channels, like DM Digital, Ummah, Noor etc on a daily basis is contrary the Sunnah and these soofee bareilwees manifest elements of their shee’ism. These people are unaware of the Sunnah and also ignorant of the position of the Scholars of research and verification who have prohibited and warned from cursing and abusing Yazeed.<br /><br />They also clarified that Yazeed directly himself had no involvement in the unlawful death of Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), nor did he order any such tragedy and nor was he happy with what occurred. We will just present the statements of Imaam Ghazzalee who is well respected and revered amongst the soofees and bareilwee Hanafees, he said,<br /><br />“It is not correct that he (Yazeed) killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu), or gave such an order nor was he happy or in agreement with this so when all of this is not established from him how can one conjecture or assume this about him as assuming (such negative) things about a Muslim are Haraam (unlawful) as Allaah the Most High said, “Oh You who believe beware of a lot of conjecture for verily some conjecture is sin.”  This action does not clarify the actual reality if you do not know and it is obligatory for every muslims to assume good about another Muslim and so it is possible that same should apply to him (ie Yazeed)” (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)<br /><br />Similarly he said in another book,<br /><br />“If you are asked, is it permissible to curse Yazeed because he killed Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu) or he was the one who ordered the killing? Then we will answer, this is not established or proven in reality and up until it is not established or proven it is not permissible to say he killed or gave the order to kill Hussain (RadhiAllaahu Anhu)” (Ihyaa Uloom ud-Deen 3/131)<br /><br />He Imaam Ghazzalee further said,<br /><br />“Supplicating on behalf of Yazeed for Allaah having mercy upon his is not permissible but rather it is recommended and it is constitutes the supplication, “Oh Allaah Forgive all the Believing men and women” because Yazeed was a believer, and Allaah knows best.” (Wafyaat al-A’yyaan 2/450)<br /><br />Imaam Ghazaalee said, <br /><br />“Whoever thinks that Yazeed ordered the death of Hussain or he agreed to it then that person is the worst fool.” (Taareekh Ibn Khalkaan 1/465) <br /><br />Refer to the previous parts for further statements from Imaam Ghazzalee. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/raful-al-laaimah-aanil-aimah-lifting-the-blame-from-the-imams-series-part-20-in-defence-of-yazid-ibn-muawiyyah-part-4/">http://www.salafiri.com/raful-al-laaima ... ah-part-4/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Share this and receive reward.</div>
