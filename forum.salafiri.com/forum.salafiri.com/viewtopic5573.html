So if someone comes and the Imaam is in prostration then make the Takbeer and go into sajdah. This is from the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him),<br /><br />“…The part of the prayer you get (along with the imam) offer it, and the part you miss complete it (afterwards)…” [Abu Dawud and narrated by Abu Hurayrah]<br /><br />The reason being that perhaps this prostration that is caught will be a reason for sins being forgiven. Therefore, do not miss out on it. He should make prostration then stand with the Imaam. However, it is not counted as a rak’ah (unit), because the rak’ah is counted if you caught the rukoo’ (bowing).”<br /><br /><em>By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-’Uthaymeen may Allah have mercy on him.  “Liqaa’atul Baabil Maftooh” 1/408.</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/10/07/what-is-better-entering-salah-while-the-imaam-is-in-prostration-or-wait-until-he-raises-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/">http://daarulhadeeth.org/2014/10/07/wha ... uthaymeen/</a><!-- m --></div>
