<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">If Allaah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Deen ‘Religion’ – Shaykh Ibn Baaz</span></span></strong><br /><br /><em>The following are the excerpts from A speech delivered by His Eminence at Al-Jami` Al-Kabir in Riyadh on 27/4/1400 A.H., published in His Eminence's book &quot;Collection of Miscellaneous Fatwas and Articles&quot;, vol. 9, pp. 128-141.</em> Read the full speech at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alifta.net">http://www.alifta.net</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;If Allaah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Din 'religion'.&quot;</span></em> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim).<br /><br />This important Hadith shows us the excellence of comprehending Deen.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Comprehending religion</span></strong> includes understanding the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and Islam. Islam covers the basics of Shari`ah, Allaah's Ordainment's, His Prohibitions, a servant's duty towards Allaah and other servants and Allaah's fear, glorification, and watchfulness. In fact, the first step towards attaining knowledge is fearing Allaah (Exalted be He), honoring His Sanctities, and watching Him in all deeds.<br /><br />Whoever does not <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">fear or be aware of Allaah</span></strong> (Exalted be He) in their deeds, all their knowledge will be worthless. However, true beneficial knowledge and understanding of Din that leads to happiness is that which instills Allaah's Awe in a Muslim's heart, directs them to honor Allaah's Sanctities, pushes them to obey Allaah's Orders and abstain from His Prohibitions, and urges them to call to Allaah (Exalted be He) and to clarify Shari`ah to people. So, anyone who is granted comprehension in religion in this way, Allah (Exalted be He) has indeed wanted to do them good.<br /><br />On the other hand, anyone deprived of these blessings will be among the ignorant, misguided and negligent who renounce attaining the knowledge that Allaah (Exalted be He) has made obligatory. They will be among those whom Allaah (Exalted be He) has not wanted to do good to them. Further, Allaah (Exalted be He) talks about Kafirs (disbelievers) who turn away from the purpose of their creation, to teach us that it is our duty, as Muslims, to haste to comprehend religion and ask about any unclear matter. Allaah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color: #0000FF">But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned. [Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 3]</span></em> Allaah (Glorified be He) also says: <em><span style="color: #0000FF">And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth. [Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 57]</span></em><br /><br />Consequently, it is the duty of a Muslim to seek for attaining knowledge in religion, to attend to, reflect on, and benefit from the Qur'an and pay great attention to, study, apply, and memorize the Sunnah as much as possible. When a person neglects these two basics, it is an indication that Allaah (Exalted be He) did not will good for him. They are doomed since their heart is corrupt and deviating from the path to guidance. We ask Allaah to protect and keep us away from whatever displeases Him! Dear Muslims, it is incumbent upon us to learn our religion and know its rulings and to attend to, meditate, reflect on, recite, and apply the Qur'an. In addition, we should give great care to, memorize, apply and study the Sunnah along with asking about ambiguous matters. Muslims should ask those who have more knowledge to find out the correct answer. Allaah (Glorified be He) says: <em><span style="color: #0000FF">&quot;So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know.&quot; [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 43]</span></em><br /><br />Moreover, a Muslim can attend knowledge lessons and benefit from them and study with other knowledgeable Muslims to benefit from them and add to himself. In this way, a Muslim can attain comprehension of religion and avoid the characteristics of the negligent and heedless. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &quot;If Allaah wills to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the Din.&quot; [1]<br /><br />[1] Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on knowledge, no. 71; Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1037; Ibn Majah, Sunan, Introduction, no. 221; Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 4, p. 93; Malik, Al-Muwatta*, Book on miscellaneous matters, no. 1667; and Al-Darimy, Sunan, Introduction, no. 226.'<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/12/23/if-allah-wills-to-do-good-to-a-person-he-makes-them-comprehend-deen-religion/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/12/23/i ... -religion/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Sun Dec 11, 2016 11:06 pm</p><hr />
