<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Tableeghee returns from the dead</span></span></span></em></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Reference:</span></strong> Kabar kee Zindagee awr Mawt kee Jund Manaazir Waaqi’aat wa Mushaahadaat, published by Maktabah Khaleel Yoosuf (Market Urdu Bazaar – Lahore, Pakistan)<br /><br />Ahmad Noor says: “Taahir Shaah at-Tableeghee comes to life after death”.<br /><br />“Some years ago Taahir Shaah became ill and was admitted to hospital. When his health deteriorated the souls of [both] his mother and father visited him and informed him that the time had arrived for him to move on to the next world (death), and that they are both waiting for him.<br /><br />Just at that time, two angels came to take him for the meeting with the Lord (Allaah). So the angels took the soul of Taahir Shaah to the heavens, where he met Mawlaana Yoosuf (the leader of the Jamaa’ah at-Tableegh and the son of Muhammad Ilyaas – the founder of the Jamaa’ah at-Tableegh) and Ahmad ‘Alee al-Laahoree.<br /><br />The two Shaykhs were surprised that Allaah had requested (the soul of) Taahir Shaah (be taken), since no-one now remained on earth who would continue the da’wah efforts.<br /><br />[Whilst still in heaven…]<br /><br />So the two Shaykhs complained to Shaykh Ilyaas (the founder of Jamaa’ah at-Tableegh) concerning this issue. So Shaykh Ilyaas went to see the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) and complained to him regarding this issue. So Muhammad Ilyaas requested Taahir Shaah to return [back] to earth.<br /><br />And at that time, Taahir Shaah had just died in hospital, and his body was being carried to his house. Suddenly, Taahir Shaah stood up and walked to his house himself.<br /><br />This story was narrated to me by Taahir Shaah himself, and I am relating it to you just as he had informed me”.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Translator’s note:</span></strong> Taahir Shaah is a doctor at the Faculty of Medicine (Kulliyah Nashtar at-Tibbiyyah) in Multan, Pakistan.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2016 12:12 am</p><hr />
