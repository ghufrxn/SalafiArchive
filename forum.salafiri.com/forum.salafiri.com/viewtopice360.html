				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Fatwa on Islamic/Educational Animated Cartoon Movies</span></strong><br /><em>Shaikh Saleh ibn Abdullah al-Fawzan &amp; Permanent Committee</em><br /><br />This is the Fatwa on educational cartoons. One is by Shaikh Fawzaan and the other by the Lajnah Ad Daaimah.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaikh Salih Al Fawzaan was asked:</span></strong><br /><br />What is the ruling on nurturing children upon Cartoons of which the goal is to benefit them and teach them good manners?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaikh said:</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>Allah made pictures Haraam, and it is Haraam to acquire them so how can we nurture our children upon them?? How can we nurture them upon something that is Haraam, upon pictures that are Haraam and drawings that move and speak and are similar to human beings? This is an evil picture and it is unlawful to nurture children upon it.<br /><br />This is what the Kuffar want. They want us to oppose what the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم prohibited us from.  And the Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم prohibited us from pictures, and using them, and acquiring them. And those who spread it (cartoons) between the youth and the Muslims, claiming that it is from nurturing (the children) then this is immoral nurturing. And the correct nurturing is to teach them what will benefit them in their religion and worldly affairs.</ul><br />Link: ajurry.com/vb/showthread.php?t=12724<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Q:</span></strong> What is the ruling on watching and buying islamic animated-cartoon movies, given that these movies present purposeful and beneficial stories for children which promote good character, dutifulness to parents, honesty, offering Salah (Prayer) regularly and the like. These animated movies are intended as good substitutes for television which has become widespread. However, the problem we face is related to the fact that such movies present hand-drawn pictures of humans and animals. Is it permissible to watch these animated cartoons? Please advise. May Allah reward you with the best!<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">A:</span></strong> It is not permissible to buy, sell or use cartoon movies, because they include Haram pictures. Raising children should be done in ways that are Islamically acceptable with regard to teaching, disciplining, encouraging them to offer Salah and taking good care of them.<br /><br />May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br /><br /><em>Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2010/09/06/fatwa-on-islamic-animated-cartoon-movies/">https://abdurrahman.org/2010/09/06/fatw ... on-movies/</a><!-- m --></div>
