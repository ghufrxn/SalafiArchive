<title type="html"><![CDATA[A Great Advice &amp; Some Compassionate Words Regarding the Differing Between the People of Knowledge]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forum.salafiri.com/viewtopic.php?t=886&amp;p=930#p930"><![CDATA[
<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">From our noble father, Al-Allaamah, Ash-shaykh, Saalih ibn Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan (May Allaah preserve him)</span></strong><br /><br />After the Fajr Salaah at the King Sa'ood Masjid in Jeddah, during the completion of the commentary of the Chapter of Fasting from the book 'Daleel-ut-Taalib Li'Nayl-il-Mutaalib' by Ash-Shaykh Mur'ee ibn Yusuf Al-Maqdisee Al- Hanbalee, in response to a questioner requesting some finishing advice before ending:<br /><br /><em>Wednesday 24th Sha'baan 1434h / Corresponding to 3rd July 2013.</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The questioner said:</span></strong><br /><br />May Allaah treat you well, we shall end with this question; Is there any blessed word which you would like to direct to your sons and your brothers from amongst the students of knowledge in the whole Islamic nation?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">The Shaykh (may Allaah preserve him and keep him safe) replied:</span></strong><br /><br />Yes certainly;<br /><br />We advise you to have taqwa in Allaah, and persistence in seeking knowledge, being assiduous in that, and to act on what Allaah has taught you, to call to Allaah Azza wa Jall, and to teach the people what you have learnt.<br /><br />And (we advise you to) leave disputing, reviling others and unnecessary interfering, so much so that they divide the ummah and divide the students of knowledge, like “be warned of so and so, do not sit with so and so, do not read to so and so!” <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">This is not permissible.</span></strong> If so and so has an error, then advise one another between yourselves.<br /><br />As for you spreading this amongst the people and warning from him, yet he is a scholar, a student of knowledge, or a pious man, but he errs, then this spreading is not obligatory.<br /><br /><em>&quot;Indeed, those who like that wrongdoing should be spread amongst those who believe,<br />for them is a painful punishment in this world and in the hereafter, and Allaah knows<br />whilst you know not.&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 24:19)</em><br /><br />The obligatory thing is advising one another between the Muslims, the obligatory thing is having love between the Muslims, especially between the students of knowledge, and especially between the scholars, honouring the scholars, not offering recommendation for some of them and warning from others – this is a cause of many evils, a cause of disputation and hatred for one another, and a cause of tribulation. Stay away from these matters, may Allaah reward you all with good.<br /><br />Be how Allaah Subhaanah intended:<br /><br /><em>&quot;Indeed this is your nation, one nation...&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 21:92)</em><br /><br /><em>&quot;And do not be like those who became divided and differed after clear proofs came to them, and those, for them is a great punishment.&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 3:105)</em><br /><br />Be fervent in joining together, be fervent in advising between yourselves, be fervent in working together upon piety and taqwa – and be warned about that which divides the Muslims. Especially in this age, the Muslims are in need of coming together, in need of cutting off disputation between themselves, and in need of working together upon piety and taqwa. Do not become a  helper to the enemy of the Muslims in the dispersion of the Muslims and the division of them.<br /><br />If division takes place between the scholars and the students of knowledge then who will remain for the ummah? The calamity is not due to the common folk, it is only upon the students of knowledge who rectify between the people and teach them – so leave these issues, these disputes and polemics, and this unnecessary and reprehensible affair.<br /><br /><em>&quot;And you should not backbite one another, would one of you like to eat the dead flesh of his brother?&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 49:12)</em><br /><br /><em>&quot;And do not obey every offensive opposer, who goes about with gossip, a preventer of good, transgressing and sinful'&quot;(Al-Qur'aan 68:10,11,12)</em><br /><br />So do not obey these ones, lest you become a help to shaytaan in the division of the ummah and its segregation. Whoever you find fault in, then advise him if that thing is confirmed, and do not simply affirm the truth of rumours.<br /><br /><em>&quot;Oh you who believe, if a disobedient one comes to you with some information, then clarify, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and you end up regretful over what you have done&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 49:6)</em><br /><br /><em>&quot;Oh you who believe, when you travel out in the path of Allaah then clarify, and do not say to one who casts the greeting of peace to you 'you are not a believer'.&quot; (Al-Qur'aan 4:94)</em><br /><br />Allaah Jalla wa Alaa has urged the Muslims to unity, to the unifying the word of the Muslims, to working together, and to mutual advice.<br /><br />We do not say 'leave errors', no, rectify the error – We say 'rectify the error, do not just leave it', rather rectify it with the sharee'ah-legislated methods.<br /><br />May Allaah grant everyone the ability to do what He loves and what pleases Him. And may the Salaah and Salaam be upon our prophet Muhammad, and upon all of his family and companions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">(End of the Shaykhs speech)</span></strong><br /><br />The audio recording of this may be accessed here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VIraFVURaA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VIraFVURaA</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Fri Dec 23, 2016 10:45 pm</p><hr />
