<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Praying in Folded Garments</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong> saadburbank</strong><br /><br />Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen rahimahullaah was asked the following question:<br /><br />Q: What is the ruling on a person folding his sleeves during the prayer?<br /><br />A: If he were to fold them because of the prayer then it enters into the saying of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alaihi wa sallam: “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones, and not to fold back clothing nor hair.”<br /><br />[Agreed Upon; from a narration of Ibn Abbaas: Reported by al-Bukhaaree no. 810 &amp; Muslim no. 490]<br /><br />And as for if he had folded (his sleeves) before, due to some work – before he had entered into the prayer, or he folded them because of plentiful perspiration and the like; then that is not disliked.<br /><br />As for if he folded them because they were long, then he should shorten them so that he does not fall into pride.<br /><br />[Source: Majmoo` Fataawaa of Ibn Uthaymeen vol. 13 pge. 308]<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/10/10/praying-in-folded-garments/</strong><br /><br />Share this:<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2016 8:40 am</p><hr />
