As for the Hadith of Muhammad ﷺ said:<br /><br /><em>Every condition that is not in the book of Allaah then it is futile, then this is to be taken to refer to other than prescribed and allowable conditions.</em><br /><br />Sahih Muslim - The Book of Divorce Book no. 009, Hadith no. 3587<br /><br /><br />But with regards to this then the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ criticised Ali RadhiAllahu Anhu: When he wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl and he, the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ then he said:<br /><br /><em>The daughter of Allaah’s Messenger ﷺ and the daughter of Allaah's enemy are not to be united together; i.e. That Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger ﷺ and the daughter of Abu Jahl that they are not to be united together.</em><br /><br />Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 62 (Book of Marriage), Hadith no. 4887<br /><br /><br />So if he agrees to this condition then he must keep to this condition, and Allaah is the One who aids.<br /><br />-<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>Taken from What I Witnessed in Saudi Arabia: Q &amp; A session by Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee Rahimahullaah; see <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.troid.ca/">www.troid.ca</a><!-- w --> for the publication.</strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Transcibed by Umm Safura b.
