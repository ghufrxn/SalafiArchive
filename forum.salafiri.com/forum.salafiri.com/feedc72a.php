<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Some Narrations Regarding Reading The Qur’aan &amp; Reflecting Upon It</span></strong><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />1 – From Anas bin Malik –Radi Allaahu anhu– who said:<br /><br />‘The wife of Uthmaan bin ‘Affan –Radi Allaahu anhu– said when they killed him: ‘You have killed him, while he was spending the night awake with the Qur’aan.’<br /><br /><em>[al-Hileeyah]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />2 – From Nafa’ that it was asked to him: what would Ibn Umar –Radi Allaahu anhu– do in his home?<br /><br />He answered:<br /><br />‘You would not be able to bear what he would do, he would make Wudu for every prayer, and he would read the Qur’aan during the times between the prayers.’<br /><br /><em>[Tabaqaat Ibn Sa’d]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />3 – From Nafa’ who said: When Abdullaah ibn Umar –Radi Allaahu anhu– would recite this Ayaah:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;۞أَلَمۡ يَأۡنِ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓاْ أَن تَخۡشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمۡ لِذِكۡرِ ٱللَّهِ &gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allaah &gt;&gt; he would begin to cry and would be overcome by crying.’<br /><br /><em>[al-Musanaf]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />4 – Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood –Radi Allaahu anhu– said:<br /><br />‘Indeed these hearts are vessels, so busy them with the Qur’aan, and do not busy them with other things.<br /><br /><em>[al-Musanaf]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />5 – From Ibn ‘Abbas –Radi Allaahu anhu:<br /><br />‘Allaah guaranteed for the one who follows the Qur’aan that he will not be misguided in the Dunyaa, nor will he be miserable in the Hereafter, then he would recite:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;فَإِمَّا يَأۡتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدٗى فَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشۡقَىٰ&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt; whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter]. &gt;&gt;<br /><br /><em>[al-Musanaf]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />6 – From Nafa’ who said:<br /><br />Ibn Umar –Radi Allaahu anhu– used to recite in his prayer and if he passed an Ayaah which mentioned Paradise he would stop and ask Allaah for Paradise and he would supplicate and cry. And if he passed by an Ayaah which mention the Hell-Fire he would stop, supplicate and seek Allaah’s forgiveness.’<br /><br /><em>[‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />7 – From Nafa’ who said:<br /><br />‘Ibn Umar never ever read these two Ayaat from the last part of Soorah Baqarah except that he would cry:<br /><br />&lt;&lt;وَإِن تُبۡدُواْ مَا فِيٓ أَنفُسِكُمۡ أَوۡ تُخۡفُوهُ يُحَاسِبۡكُم بِهِ ٱللَّهُۖ&gt;&gt;<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. &gt;&gt; then he would say: ‘Indeed this is a severe level of accountability.’<br /><br /><em>[al-Hileeyah]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />8 – From Ibn Mas’ood –Radi Allaahu anhu– who said:<br /><br />‘Be continuous in looking into the Mus’haf (the Qur’aan).’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /> <br /><br />9 – From Yunus bin Jubayr who said:<br /><br />‘Jundub accompanied us until we reached the edge of the town and we said, advise us.’<br /><br />He said:<br /><br />‘I advise you to have fear of Allaah and I advise you with the Qur’aan, since it is light on a dark night, and the brightness of the day.’<br /><br /><em>[Shua’b al-Eemaan]</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Taken From: ‘Min Ahkbar as-Salaf’ p.100]</span></strong><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/some-narrations-regarding-reading-the-quraan-reflecting-upon-it/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... g-upon-it/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Mon Mar 06, 2017 11:55 pm</p><hr />
