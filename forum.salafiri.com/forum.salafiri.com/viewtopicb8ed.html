				<div class="content">The Respect and Status of the ʿUlamāʾ According to the ʿUlamāʾ<br />Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsari (d.1367/1948), Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn Shāh al-Rāshidi al-Sindhī (d.1416/1996) and Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hadī al-Madkhalī<br /><br />Around 20 years or so ago, some burnt mujrim liars from Birmingham said: “[1] Who is Badīʿ al-Dīn, [2] where are his chains [3] who from the ʿUlamāʾ recommended him.”<br /><br />I have answered [1] by compiling a biography of him at the turn of the century. I answered [2] by showing Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn has over 140 direct chains back to the Messenger of Allāh Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam, in terms of his knowledge, his study of the sacred sciences and Ḥadīth, and they were impeccable and pristine as they come, Wa Lillahil Ḥamd. Here is the answer to [3], and let’s see if you can get your head around this.<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ bin Hadī al-Madkhalī was a student of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī, and Shaykh Badīʿ was in turn the student of Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī.<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ bin Hadī al-Madkhalī refers to Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī as, “al-Muḥaddith Abuʾl Wafāʾ ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī.” (Tadhkīr al-Nābihīn Bisīr Aslāfahum Ḥufāẓ al-Ḥadīth al-Sābiqīn waʾl Lāḥiqīn, p.293.)<br /><br />Shaykh Rabīʿ also said about him: “Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī was from the scholars of India, He resembled Ibn Taymiyyah in terms of this strong memory and firm comprehension and no one was able to debate with him. Many people were guided through him, Hindus Christians, deviant grave worshippers and others…” (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=62086">http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=62086</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br />Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī, the teacher of Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī, was a formidable and fervent defender of the Madhhab of Ahl a-Ḥadīth. Shaykh ThanāʾAllāh Amritsarī (d.1367/1948) said about Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī in 1945ce during a conference in India, while introducing him to the conference: “Today the keynote speaker of this conference is a young scholar hailing from Sindh who is a specialist in Asmāʾ al-Rijāl.”<br /><br />And then Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hadī al-Madkhalī himself said about Shaykh Badīʿ al-Dīn al-Sindhī: “Al-Shaykh al-ʿAllāmah al-Muḥaddith al-Faqīh, the one with deep comprehension, beneficial to the students and of great stature.” (Tadhkīr al-Nābihīn Bisīr Aslāfahum Ḥufāẓ al-Ḥadīth al-Sābiqīn waʾl Lāḥiqīn, p.292).<br /><br />Allāh raised the rank of these righteous and virtuous scholars, they were blessed with immense honour and respect. The ignorant ruwaybidah, will not take their place no matter how much they shout and scream.</div>
