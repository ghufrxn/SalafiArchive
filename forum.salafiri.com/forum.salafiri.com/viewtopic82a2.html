				<div class="content">From the worst of habits that many have adopted within our societies, is the swearing and cursing of another person's parent/s. Profanity in speech is bad enough, but cursing someone's parents is much worse. When it comes to using foul language and swearing, The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Allah hates the one who uses foul language.”<br /><strong>• [Riyaḍ as-Saliḥīn Book. 1, No. 626]</strong><br /><br />As for swearing a person's parents:<br />Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them both):<br />Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. &quot;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&quot; It was asked (by the people), &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! How does a man curse his parents?&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;'A man reviles the father of another man, the latter then reviles the former's father and mother.&quot;<br /><strong>• [Saḥiḥ al-Bukhari: 5973]</strong><br /><br />The narration in Abu Dawud (5141) reads:<br />‘Abd Allah b. ‘Amr (b. al-As) reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:<br />A man’s cursing of his parents is one of the grave sins. He was asked : Messenger of Allah! How does a man curse his parents? He replied: He curses the father of a man who then curses his father, and he curses a man’s mother who then (in turn) curses his.<br /><strong>• [Authenticated by al-Albani (رحمه الله)]</strong><br /><br />ibn 'Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them both) narrates that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: &quot;Cursed is the one who reviles his father, cursed is the one who reviles his mother, and cursed is the one who slaughters for other than the sake of Allah (type of major shirk)...&quot;<br /><strong>• [Musnad of Aḥmad: 1875 - Authenticated by Shu'aib al-Arna`oot, See also Saḥiḥ al-Jaami': 5891]</strong><br /><br />As we see have seen from the above mentioned ḥadeeth, one of the ways of reviling your own parents, is to curse/swear/revile another person's parents, who then in turn says the same or worse about your parents.<br /><br />May Allah rectify our affairs, purify our hearts and keep us steadfast upon goodness, Ameen.<br /><br /><strong>• Abu Sarah Imraan Mollagee</strong><br /><br />Source: <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=485036851700099&amp;id=440944716109313&amp;ref=m_notif&amp;notif_t=like&amp;actorid=100007107840510" class="postlink">Abu Sarah Imraan Mollagee</a></div>
