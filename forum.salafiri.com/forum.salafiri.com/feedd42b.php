Ibn Qudamah, Ibn al-Jawzi and the Hadith Corpus<br /><br />Hafiz Ibn Hajr in his al-Durrar al-Kaminah &amp; Imam al-Dhahabi in his Tarikh mention numerous examples of people who used Hadith in a negative way, mostly for gaining wealth and status and they were not from it's people. <br /><br />For example They would dictate Hadith for money and didn't know the science but had the chains. Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi alludes to this in his Talbis Iblis and Sayyid al-Khatir. So, this is the group of people who were known as scholars of Hadith or the people of Hadith who are being Referred to. It was not the Ahl al-Hadith who knew Hadith, their rulings, it's science and how to act upon them.<br /><br />2. People now rely on these statement of Hafiz Ibn al-Jawzi, and lately his statement on al-Ghazali as his books like Daf Shubhah al-Tashbih and Kitab Akhbar Sifat Hafiz Ibn Rajab quotes Imam Ibn Qudamah (d.620H), who was from Ibn Jawzi (d.597H) era,<br /><br />&quot;Ibn al-Jawzi was the leading authority of the method of preaching in his era. He also authored excellent works in various sciences, and his efforts were generally accepted. He would teach Fiqh &amp; authored works in this regard, just as he had memorised Hadith &amp; also authored books. However, we are not pleased with his writings &amp; respect to the Sunnah (Aqidah) not his approach (Manhaj)&quot; (Ibn Rajab, al-Dhayl Ala Tabaqat al-Hanabillah 3:446+, Dar al-Uthaymin, 2005)<br /><br />Al-Ghazali, despite being praised by Ibn al-Jawzi was also heavily reprimanded by him for the latter's lack of skill in Hadith sciences and his usage of weak Hadith. <br /><br />Al-Ghazali himself alludes to his contemporaries, those from his own school of Ash'arism who refuted him For his lack of skill and weakness in Hadith sciences. This is what led al-Ghazali to revisit Hadith sciences. (Refer to Munqidh Min al-Dalal, where he expressed his spat with his contemporaries) <br /><br />The point is, to understand differences within a framework which are acceptable And which can be resolved within Ahl al-Sunnah and to make a distinction between the erroneous ways who fall outside of this framework.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Mon Jun 22, 2020 1:49 am</p><hr />

Imām Bukhārī, the esteemed teacher of Imām Tirmidhī establishes the same chapter heading, <br /><br />باب وَضْعِ الْيُمْنَى عَلَى الْيُسْرَى<br /><br />“Chapter To place the right hand on the left”<br /><br />حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ مَسْلَمَةَ، عَنْ مَالِكٍ، عَنْ أَبِي حَازِمٍ، عَنْ سَهْلِ بْنِ سَعْدٍ، قَالَ كَانَ النَّاسُ يُؤْمَرُونَ أَنْ يَضَعَ الرَّجُلُ الْيَدَ الْيُمْنَى عَلَى ذِرَاعِهِ الْيُسْرَى فِي الصَّلاَةِ‏<br /><br />Abd Allah bin Maslamah narrated to us on the authority of Malik on the authority of Abi Hazim on the authority of Sahl bin Sa’d (RadhiAllahu Anhu) who said “The people were ordered that a person should place the right hand on the left forearm in the prayer.” (Bukhari no.740)<br /><br />Bukhari establishes the following chapter heading<br /><br />بَابُ مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ فِي الْجَنَابَةِ ثُمَّ غَسَلَ سَائِرَ جَسَدِهِ، وَلَمْ يُعِدْ، غَسْلَ مَوَاضِعِ الْوُضُوءِ مَرَّةً أُخْرَى<br /><br /><br />حَدَّثَنَا يُوسُفُ بْنُ عِيسَى، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا الْفَضْلُ بْنُ مُوسَى، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا الأَعْمَشُ، عَنْ سَالِمٍ، عَنْ كُرَيْبٍ، مَوْلَى ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، عَنْ مَيْمُونَةَ، قَالَتْ وَضَعَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَضُوءًا لِجَنَابَةٍ فَأَكْفَأَ بِيَمِينِهِ عَلَى شِمَالِهِ مَرَّتَيْنِ، أَوْ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ فَرْجَهُ، ثُمَّ ضَرَبَ يَدَهُ بِالأَرْضِ ـ أَوِ الْحَائِطِ ـ مَرَّتَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلاَثًا، ثُمَّ مَضْمَضَ وَاسْتَنْشَقَ، وَغَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ وَذِرَاعَيْهِ، ثُمَّ أَفَاضَ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ الْمَاءَ، ثُمَّ غَسَلَ جَسَدَهُ، ثُمَّ تَنَحَّى فَغَسَلَ رِجْلَيْهِ‏.‏ قَالَتْ فَأَتَيْتُهُ بِخِرْقَةٍ، فَلَمْ يُرِدْهَا، فَجَعَلَ يَنْفُضُ بِيَدِهِ‏.‏<br /><br /><br />It was narrated to us by Yusuf bin Isa who said al-Fadal bin Musa informed us who said al-A’mash informed us on the authority of Salim on the authority of Kuraib, the servant of Ibn Abbas on the authority of Ibn Abbas on the authority of Maimunah who said Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out and then washed his face and forearms and poured water over his head and washed his body. Then he shifted from that place and washed his feet. I brought a piece of cloth, but he did not take it and removed the traces of water from his body with his hand.&quot; (Bukhari no.274)<br /><br />The claim that 13 narrators who eventually narrate from Wa’il Ibn Hujr do not transmit narrations which are all agreement in wording, they differ themselves in what they narrate with some omitting certain aspects whilst others are detailed and other brief. Some of these narrations are weak in themselves, therefore to single out the narration of Mu’ammal from Sufyan is incorrect. Furthermore, Mu’ammal is below the chain compared to 8 who narrate directly from Asim bin Kulaib and some of them have narrated words to the affect that establish placing the hands on the chest for example Za’idah. <br /><br />Sometimes the claim is that Kulaib bin Shihab is alone in reporting these words while other do not report these from from Wa’il. At times all those who narrate from Wa’il do not even mention the fastening of the hands eg Abd al-Rahman bin al-Yahsabi (Musnad Ahmad 4:316), Hujr Abil al-Anbas al-Hadrami from Wail directly mentions nothing of the placing of the hands. (Abu Dawud 1:264), Alqamah from Wail where he mentions placing of the hands on each other, this is a very lengthy hadith with additional information (Muslim 2:301).<br /><br />Baihaqi (al-Khilafiyat (2:252) says Mu’ammal is alone in reporting from al-Thawri but he himself puts a chapter in his al-Sunan al-Kubra (2:30-31) on placing the hands on the chest and cites this very hadith of Mu’ammal <br /><br />Then people claim that Sufyan was alone in reporting it and the list of the claims is endless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Tue Aug 08, 2017 2:16 pm</p><hr />

<strong>Al-Hadith Hazro Magazine No.5 <br /><br />Article no.3<br /><br />Muhadith Zubair Ali Zai<br /><br />Translated Abu Ubaydah</strong><br /><br /> <br /><br /><strong>15th Night Of Sha'ban And Special Acts Of Worship</strong><br /><br />There are some ahadith that are mentioned which talk about the virtue of the 15th night of Sha’ban. The meaning of those ahadith are that, Allah descends to the lowest heaven and forgives the sins of people in such a great amount that it is more in number than the hair's of the goats from the Kalb tribe.<br /><br />Due to these ahadith many people carry out extra amounts of worship during this night. An overview of these narrations are as follows:<br /><br /><em>&quot;On the 15th night of Sha’ban Allah specifically looks at the creation and forgives the sins of all the Muslim creation, except for the Mushriks and those Muslims who keep grudges of their Muslim brethren.&quot; </em><br /><br />(As-Silsilah as-Sahiha 3/135 Hadith no.1144)<br /><br />An overview of the Takhrij for the narrations which Shaikh mentioned are below:<br /><br /><strong>1. Hadith of Mu'adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br /><br />Imam Makhul narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>from Malik ibn Yukhamir from Mu’adh Ibn Jabal (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES] </strong><br />This hadith is present with the same above chain of narration in the following books:<br /><br />Kitab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (hadith no.512, other manuscript no.524), Sahih Ibn Hibban (Mawarid adh-Dhaman no.1980, al-Ihsan no.5636), Amali of Abil Hasan al-Qazuni (4/2), al-Majlis as-Sabi’ of Abi Muhamad al-Jawhari (3/2), Juz min hadith Muhamad Ibn Sulaiman ar-Rabi’i (217/1 and 218/1), al-Amali of Abil Qasim al-Husaini (Qaf 12/1), Shu’bul Iman of al-Bayhaqi (3/382 hadith no.3833,5 / hadith no.6628), Tarikh Dimishq of Ibn Asakir (40/172, 57/75), ath-Thalith Watis’in of al-Hafidh Abdil Ghani al-Maqdisi (Qaf 44/2), Sifat Rabul ‘Alamin of Ibn A’jab, 7/2, 129/2), al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (20/108,109 hadit no.215), and al-Awsat of at-Tabarani (7/397 hadith no.6772), Hilyatul Awliya of Abi Nu’aim al-Isbahani (5/191)<br /><br />Dhahabi said, <em>“Makhul did not meet Malik Ibn Yukhamir”</em> (as-Sahihah 135/3) meaning this narration is [Munqati’].<br /><br /><strong>Outcome: </strong>This chain is [Da’if] weak. It is mentioned in the book of Usul ul-Hadith 'Taysir Mustalah al-Hadith' that:<br /><br /><em>“The Scholars (Muhadithin) are in unanimous agreement that the [Munqati’] (narration) is weak. This is because the omitted narrator is classed as being unknown (for us).”</em> (pg no.78)<br /><br /><strong>2. Hadith of Abi Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Ahwas Ibn Hakim narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>from Muhasir Ibn Habib from Abi Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong><br />Kitab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (hadith no.511, other manuscript hadith no.523), Kitab ul-Arsh of Muhamad Ibn Uthman Ibn Abi Shaybah (hadith no.87 and in it: Bishr ibn Omarah from al-Ahwas Ibn Hakim from al-Mahasir ibn Habib from Makhul from Abi Tha’labah to the end of the hadith), Hadith Abil Qasim al-Azji (67/1), Sharh Usul I’tiqad Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama’ah book of al-Lalika’i (3/445 hadith no.760), al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (22/224 hadith no.593)<br /><br />The main narrator Ahwas Ibn Hakim is [Da’if] weak according to the majority of the Muhadithin.<br /><br />Ibn Hajr said, <em>“Weak memory [Da’if ul-Hifdh]”</em> (Taqrib no.290)<br /><br />It is not established that Muhasir (Muhajir) Ibn Habib met Abu Tha’labah (Radi Allahu Anhu).<br /><br />Note: In Kitab ul-Arsh the chain contains Makhul in between Muhasir and Abu Tha’labah. In this chain there is Bishr Ibn Omarah who is [Da’if] weak. (Taqrib no.897)<br /><br />In al-Mu’jam al-Kabir of at-Tabarani (22/223 hadith no.590) al-Maharabi does [Mutabi’] of him. However two narrators from this chain, Ahmad Ibn an-Nadr al-Askari and Muhamad Ibn Adam al-Masisi are unknown. Abdurahman Ibn Muhamad al-Maharabi is a Mudalis. (Tabaqat al-Mudalisin 80/3)<br /><br />Bayhaqi narrated it through a different chain of narration:<br /><br /><em>al-Maharabi from al-Ahwas Ibn Hakim from al-Muhajir Ibn Habib from Makhul from Abi Tha’labah al-Khushani</em><br />(Shu’bul Iman no.3832)<br /><br /><strong>3. Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-‘As (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Hasan Ibn Musa narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>Ibn Lahi’a narrated to us, Huyay Ibn Abdullah narrated to us, from Abi Abdirahman al-Habali from Abdullah Ibn Amr</em><br />(Musnad Ahmad 2/176 hadith no.6642)<br /><br />This hadith is [Da’if] weak due to the [Ikhtilat] of Abdullah Ibn Lahi’a. To see the [Ikhtilat] of Ibn Lahi’a see Taqrib at-Tahdhib. (no.3563)<br /><br />There is no evidence to establish that Hasan Ibn Musa heard this hadith from Ibn Lahi’a before he committed [Ikhtilat]<br /><br />Ibn Mundhiri said,<br /><em>&quot;Ahmad narrated it from a [Layin] weak chain.&quot; </em>(at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib 3/460 hadith no.4080, also see 2/119 hadith no.1519)<br /><br />Al-Albani said,<br /><em>&quot;Rashdayn Ibn Sa’d did mutaba’at of Ibn Lahi’a.&quot;</em> (Hadith Ibn Haywiyah 3/10/1 and Silsilah as-Sahihah 3/136)<br />Also Rashdayn Ibn Sa’d Ibn Muflih al-Mihri himself is [Da’if] weak. See Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.1942)<br /><br />Therefore this narration is [Da’if] weak from two angles, it is not Hasan.<br /><br /><strong>4. Abu Musa (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Ibn Lahi’a narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>From az-Zubair Ibn Salim from adh-Dhahak Ibn Abdurahman from his father he said, I heard Abu Musa – till the end of the hadith.</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong><br />Ibn Majah (1390/2), as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (no.510, other manuscript no.522), as-Sunnah of al-Lalika’i (3/447 hadith no.763)In this chain there is Abdurahman Ibn Arzab who is [Majhul] unknown. (Taqrib no.3950). Similarly Zubair Ibn Salim is also [Majhul] unknown. (Taqrib no.1996)<br />In some books it has mistakenly been published with the name Rabi’ Ibn Sulaiman and in others it is Zubair Ibn Sulaiman.<br /><br />Outcome: This chain is [Da’if] weak<br />Note: In the other chain of Ibn Majah (1390/1) instead of Ibn Lahi’a there is Walid Ibn Muslim, who is a Mudalis and Dhahak Ibn Ayman, who is [Majhul] unknown. (Taqrib no.2965). This chain is also [Munqati’], therefore this chain is also [Da’if] weak.<br /><br /><strong>5. Hadith of Abu Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Hisham Ibn Abdurahman narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>Al-‘Amash from Abi Salih from Abi Hurairah (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]<br /></strong>Kashful Astar An Zawa’id ul-Bazar (2/436 hadith no.2046) and al-Ilal al-Mutanahiya of Ibn al-Jawzi (2/70 hadith no.921)<br />The narrator Hisham Ibn Abdurahman has an unknown status meaning he is [Majhul] unknown.<br /><br />Haythami wrote that, <em>&quot;And I do not know him.&quot;</em> (Majma az-Zawa’id 8/65)<br /><br />Outcome: this chain is [Da’if] weak<br /><br /><strong>6. Hadith of Abu Bakr as-Sidiq (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Abdul Malik Ibn Abdul Malik narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>From Mus’ab Ibn Abi Dhi’b from al-qasim Ibn Muhamad from his father or his paternal uncle from Abu Bakr as-Sidiq (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong><br />Kashful Astar (2/435 hadith no.2045), Kitab at-Tawhid of Ibn Khuzaimah (pg no.136 hadith no.200), as-Sunnah of Ibn Abi Asim (no.509, other manuscript&#058; no.521), as-Sunnah of al-Lalika’i (3/438, 439 hadith no.750), Akhbar Asbahan of Ibi Nu’aim (2/2), and al-Bayhaqi (in Shu’bul Iman no.3827)<br />In this chain the majority of the Muhadithin have done [Jarh] criticized Abdul Malik Ibn Abdul Malik.<br /><br />Ibn Hibban said, <em>&quot;He narrated severely rejected ahadith.&quot; </em>(Kitabul Majruhin 2/136)<br /><br />Imam Bukhari said, &quot;He is [Matruk] abandoned and [Mut-ham] accused.&quot; (at-Tarikh ul-Kabir 5/424)<br /><br />Imam Daraqutni said, <em>&quot;[Matruk] abandoned.&quot;</em> (Su’alat al-Birqani no.304)<br /><br />Mus’ab Ibn Abi Dhi’b is also not [Mu'athaq] credible and not known, See Kitab al-Jarh wa Ta’dil (8/307 tarajim no.1418)<br /><br />Outcome: This chain is [Da’if] weak<br /><br /><strong>7. Hadith Of Awf Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br /><br />Ibn Lahi’a narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br />From Abdurahman Ibn An’am from Ubadah Ibn Nusay from Kathir Ibn Mura from Awf Ibn Malik (Radi Allahu Anhu)<br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]<br /></strong>Kashful Astar (2/436 hadith no.2048) (2/436 hadith no.2048), and al-Majlis as-Sabi’ of abi Muhamad al-Jawhari (as-Sahihah 3/137)<br />In this narration there is Abdurahman Ibn Ziyad Ibn An’am who is [Da’if] according to the majority of the Muhadithin. Ibn Hajr said, &quot;He has a weak memory…and he was a righteous man.&quot; (Taqrib no.3862)<br /><br /><strong>8. Hadith of ‘Aisha (Radi Allahu Anha)</strong><br />Hajaj Ibn Artah narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>From Yahya Ibn Abi Kathir from Urwah from ‘Aisha (Radi Allahu Anha)</em><br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]</strong><br />Sunan at-Tirmidhi (1/106 hadith no.739), Ibn Majah (no.1389), Ahmad (6238 hadith no.26546), Ibn Abi Shaybah (al-Musanaf 10/438 hadith no.29849), Abd Ibn Humayd (no.1508), al-Bayhaqi in Shu’bul Iman (no.3824), and al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/66 hadith no.915)<br />Imam Tirmidhi said that, &quot;I heard Imam Bukhari say that this hadith is [Da’if] weak. Yahya (Ibn Abi Kathir) did not hear it from Urwah and Hajaj Ibn Artah did not hear it from Yahya (Ibn Abi Kathir).&quot; (at-Tirmidhi no.739)<br />Hajaj Ibn Artah is a [Da’if] weak narrator according to the majority of the Muhadithin and he is also a Mudalis. Yahya Ibn Abi Kathir is also a Mudalis.<br /><br />Outcome: This chain is [Da’if] weak. There are also 3 [Da’if] weak witnessing reports for this narration:<br />1. al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/67,68 hadith no.917)<br />This contains Sulayman Ibn Abi Karimah who is [Da’if] weak and he narrated [Munkar] rejected narrations. See Lisan ul-Mizan (3/102)<br /><br />2. al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/68, 69 hadith no.918)<br />This contains Sa’id Ibn Abdulkarim al-Wasiti whose credibility is unknown. See Lisan ul-Mizan (3/36)<br /><br />3. al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/69 hadith no.919)<br />This contains Ata ibn Ajlan who is a [Kathab] liar and he is [Matruk] abandoned. See al-Kashf ul-Hatith Aman Rami bi Wada ul-Hadith (pg no.289), Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.4594).<br /><br />The summary is that these 3 witnessing reports are also rejected.<br /><br /><strong>9. Hadith Of Ali (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Ibn Abi Sabrah narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br />From Ibrahim Ibn Muhamad from u’awiyah from Abdullah Ibn Ja’far from his father from Ali Ibn Abi Talib (Radi Allahu Anhu)<br /><br /><strong>[REFERENCES]<br /></strong>Ibn Majah (no.1388), al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/71 hadith no.923)<br />This contains Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Sabrah who was a [Kathab] liar. See Taqrib at-Tahdhib (no.7973)<br /><br />Outcome: This narration is [Mawdu’] fabricated<br />Note: There are other narrations with the same meaning from Ali (Radi Allahu Anhu) that are [Mawdu’] fabricated and rejected. See al-Mawdu’at of Ibn ul-Jawzi (2/127), Mizan ul-‘Itidal (3/120), al-La’a’li al-Masnuah (2/60)<br /><br /><strong>10. Hadith Of Kirdaws (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Isa Ibn Ibrahim al-Qurashi narrated it though the chain of:<br /><br />From Salamah Ibn Sulayman al-Jazari from Marwan Ibn Salim from Ibn Kirdaws from his father<br />(Kitab al-Ilal wal-Mutanahiyah (2/71, 72 hadith no.924)<br /><br />This contains Isa Ibn Ibrahim who is [Munkar al-Hadith] rejected in hadith and [Matruk] abandoned. Marwan Ibn Salim is [Matruk] abandoned and [Mut-ham] accused and the credibility of Salamah is unknown.<br /><br />Outcome: This chain is [Mawdu’] fabricated<br /><br /><strong>11. Hadith Of Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Salih ash-Shamumi narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>From Abdullah Ibn Dharar from Yazid Ibn Muhamad from his father from Muhamad Ibn Marwan from Ibn Umar (Radi Allahu Anhu)</em><br /><br />(al-Mawdu’at of Ibn al-Jawzi 2/128)<br /><br />In this chain the reliability of Salih, Abdullah Ibn Dharar, Yaid and Muhamad Ibn Marwan is unknown i.e. they are [Majhul] unknown. Ibn al-Jawzi said that, &quot;We have no doubt at all that this hadith is [MAwdu’] fabricated.&quot; (al-Mawdu’at 2/129)<br /><br /><strong>12: Hadith Of Muhamad Ibn Ali al-Baqir</strong><br />Ali Ibn Asim ([Da’if]) narrated it through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>Amr Ibn Miqdam from Ja’far Ibn Muhamad from his father</em><br />(al-Mawdu’at 2/128,129)<br /><br />Amr Ibn Abil Miqdam Rafidhi is a [Matruk] abandoned narrator. Suyuti said that, this chain is [Mawdu’] fabricated. (al-La’a’li al-Masnuah (2/59)<br /><br />The chain below Ali Ibn Asim has [Nadhar] it is highly unreliable<br /><br /><strong>13. Hadith Of Ubay Ibn Ka’b (Radi Allahu Anhu)</strong><br />Ibn Asakir narrated it with unknown narrators through the chain of:<br /><br /><em>Muhamad Ibn Hazim from adh-Dhahak Ibn Mizahim from Ubay Ibn Ka’b.</em><br /><br />See Dhayl al-La’a’li al-Masnuah (pg no. 112, 113). This narration is [Munqati’] disconnected as well as being [Mawdu’] fabricated.<br /><br /><strong>14. The Saying Of Makhul The Tabi’i</strong><br />Imam Makhul said that, <br /><em>&quot;On the 15th night of Sha’ban Allah specially looks at the people of the Earth and forgives the sins of all the people, except for the Kafir and those who keep a grudge against one another.&quot;</em> (Shu’bul Iman of al-Bayhaqi 3/381 hadith no.3830)<br /><br />This chain is [Hasan] however it is not a hadith rather it is the saying of Imam Makhul. It is known from this that [Da’if] weak and [Majhul] unknown narrators raised the saying of Makhul to the level of a [Marfu’] hadith and narrated it. It is not correct to raise the saying of Makhul to the level of a [Marfu’] hadith and even if that is done then it is [Da’if] weak because it becomes [Mursal]<br /><br /><strong>A Summary Of The Tahqiq</strong><br />The narration about the 15th night of Sha’ban is not established from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) or any of the noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum)<br /><br /><strong>The Decision Of The Muhaqiq</strong><br />Abu Bakr Ibn ul-Arabi wrote that,<br /><em>&quot;There are no reliable or credible hadith about the virtues of the 15th night of Sha’ban at all. There are also no reliable or credible hadith about the decision on people’s deaths (i.e. the time of an individual’s death) being abrogated on this night. Therefore do not pay any attention at all to these unreliable ahadith.&quot; </em>(Ahkam ul-Qur’an 4/1690)<br /><br />Ibn ul-Qayim wrote that,<br /><em>&quot;There are no established narrations about making a special salah on the 15th night of Sha’ban.&quot; </em>(al-Munar al-Munif pg no.98, 99)<br /><br />Ibn ul-Qayim also goes on to say that,<br /><em>&quot;It is enormously strange that a person who has the understanding of the Sunnah performs an absolutely bizarre type of salah after listening to these fictions. (i.e. performing 100 rak’at by reciting surah ikhlas 1000 times).&quot;</em> (al-Munar al-Munif pg no.99)<br /><br /><strong>Hasan Li-Ghayrihi!?<br /></strong>The great muhadith Shaikh Albani declared the narration about the 15th of Sha’ban as being [Sahih] due to it having many routes of transmission. However this narration does not reach the level of [Sahih Li-ghayrihi]. Not one chain is [Sahih] or [Hasan Li-Thatihi] so how has it reached to the level of [Sahih Li-Ghayrihi]? Some people have said that this narration is [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi].<br /><br />There are two types of [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi]:<br />1. A narration with a [Da’if] weak chain which is in and of itself [Da’if] weak, whilst another narration is [Hasan Li-Thatihi]. This ([Da’if] weak) chain becomes [Hasan] when it is placed with the [Hasan Li-Thatihi] (narration).<br />2. A narration with a [Da’if] weak chain which is in and of itself [Da’if] weak and there are other [Da’if] weak and rejected narrations present with the same meaning. Some scholars understand these to be [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi] whilst this is a type of [Da’if] weak hadith.<br /><br /><strong>[b]Evidence No.1</strong>[/b]<br />It is absolutely not established from the Qur’an, hadith and Ijma’ that [Da’if] weak + [Da’if] weak + [Da’if] weak = [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi] is established as being a proof.<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.2</strong><br />Narrations like this are not established as being proof from the noble companions (Radi Allahu Anhum)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.3</strong><br />Narrations like this are not established as being proof from the noble Tabi’in<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.4</strong><br />Narrations like this are not established as being proof from Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim and other than them<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.5</strong><br />Apart from Imam Tirmidhi, [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi] narrations like this are not established as being proof by the general Muhadithin. For e.g.<br />Muhamad Ibn Abi Layla ([Da’if]) narrated a hadith with the chain of:<br /><br />From his brother Isa from al-Hakam from Abdurahman Ibn Abi Layla from al-Bara Ibn Azib<br /><br />which negates Rafyul Yadayn (Sunan Abi Dawud no.752). It’s chain is [Da’if] weak.<br />There are numerous [Da’if] witnessing reports of this. For e.g. See Sunan Abi Dawud (no.749, no.748). Despite all these witnessing reports Imam Abu Dawud said, <em>&quot;This hadith is not [Sahih].&quot;</em> (Abu Dawud no.752)<br /><br />There are several narrations about performing the salah in one direction during a general salah. See as-Sahihah of Shaikh al-Albani (1/564-566 hadith no.316). Not one of these are [Sahih] or [Hasan Li-Thatihi].<br /><br />Ibn Abdul Bar says about these narrations that, <em>&quot;However all these narrations are [Ma’lul] weak. The scholars of hadith do not declare them to be [Sahih].&quot;</em> (Zadul Ma’ad vol no.1 pg no.259)<br /><br />Ibn ul-Qayim also says that, <em>&quot;However it is not established from a [Sahih] chain from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam).&quot;</em> (Zadul Ma’ad vol no.1 pg no.259)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No. 6</strong><br />Ibn Kathir wrote that, &quot;It is enough (to succeed) in a debate that one establishes the opposition’s chain to be [Da’if]. This will make him unable to answer because the foundation is that all the other narrations are [Ma’dum] void (and false) except and until another (authentic) chain is established. And Allah knows best.&quot;<br />(Ikhtisar Ulum ul-Hadith pg no.85, subject no.22, other manuscript 1/274, 275, and as-Sakhawi narrated it from him in Fathul Mugith 1/287 in knowing to accept his narration and of those who respond)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.7</strong><br />Ibn ul-Qatan al-Fasi clarified about [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi] that, &quot;This does not constitute to being an evidence rather this is acted upon in the [Fadha’il A’mal] virtuous actions.&quot; (an-Nukt ala Kitab ibn us-Salah 1/402)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.8</strong><br />Ibn Hajr has declared the saying of Ibn ul-Qatan as being [Hasan Quwi]. (an-Nukt 1/402)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.9</strong><br />When the Hanafis and Shafi’is and other than them refute each other they do not use [Hasan Li-ghayrihi] type of narrations as a proof. For e.g. a (weak) narration which has the same meaning of another narration that has several [Da’if] weak chains has been declared as being [Da’if] weak by Imam Nawawi. (Khilasatul Ahkam vol no.1 pg no.377 hadith no.1173, chapter of weak)<br /><br />The narration about the Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam which has many chains of narration has been declared as being [Ma’lul] etc. by Naymawi Hanafi. See Athar as-Sunan (hadith no.353, 354, 355, 356)<br /><br /><strong>Evidence No.10</strong><br />In the modern day era there are a lot of scholars who perform [Jarh] criticise and declare narrations which have numerous chains, and do not have an excessive weakness, as being [Da’if] weak and rejected.<br /><br />For e.g the narration of:<br /><em>Muhamad Ibn Ishaq from Makhul from Mahmud Ibn ar-Rabi’ from Ubadah Ibn Samit</em><br /><br />which contains evidence about the Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam, has been said to be [Da’if] weak by the Muhadith al-Albani. (Tahqiq Sunan Abi Dawud no.823, published by Maktabutul Ma’arif, ar-Riyadh)<br /><br />However there are many witnessing reports for this narration. See Kitab ul-Qira’at of al-Bayhaqi and al-Kawakib ad-Duriyah fi Wujub al-Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam fil Jahriyah of the author. Shaikh al-Albani does not recognise it to be [Hasan Li-Ghayrihi] even though it has numerous chains and witnessing reports. (Whilst the narration of Fatiha Khalf ul-Imam is [Hasan Lithatihi] and [Sahih Li-Ghayrihi] wal-hamdullilah)<br /><br />In summary the narration about the 15th of Sha’ban is [Da’if] weak.<br /><br /><strong>Acting On [Da’if] Weak Hadith In Matters Pertaining To [Fadha'il] Virtues </strong><br />Some people recognise the [Da’if] weak narrations, which mention [Fadha'il] virtues, as proof (when it coincides with their desires) and they call towards acting upon them. However there is a group of Muhaqiqin who say that an invidual cannot act upon [Da’if] weak hadith [Mutlaqan]. Meaning according to them one cannot act upon [Da’if] weak hadith which are to do with Ahkam and [Fadha'il] virtues.<br /><br />Jamaludin Qasimi (Shami) mentioned about this methodology on [Da’if] weak hadith that, <em>&quot;Whether it is Ahkam or [Fadha'il] virtues, one should not act upon them. Ibn Sayid un-Nas mentioned it from Ibn Ma’in in Uyun al-Athar. Sakhawi attributed it to Abu Bakr Ibn ul-Arabi in Fath ul-Mugith. And it is apparent that this is the methodology of Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim, the conditions of Sahih Bukhari bear witness to it. Imam Muslim has severely criticised the narrators of [Da’if] weak hadith, as I mentioned previously. Both the Imams did not narrate a single [Da’if] weak narration to do with [Fadha'il] virtues in their respective books.&quot;</em> (Qawaid ut-Tahdith pg no.113, al-Hadith Hazro no.4 pg no.7)<br /><br />Abdullah Ibn Abbas (Radi Allahu Anhuma) was not of the view to listen to [Mursal] narrations. (See Muqadimah Sahih Muslim hadith no.21, and Nukt ala Kitab ibn us-Salah 2/553)<br /><br />It is known from this that Ibn Abbas (Radi Allahu Anhuma) did not recognise [Da’if] weak hadith about [Fadha'il] virtues as being a proof.<br /><br />Ibn Hibban said, <em>&quot;Therefore whatever hadith the [Da’if] weak individual narrates, and the narration which does not exist, both have the same ruling.&quot;</em> (Kitab al-Majruhin 1/328 biography of Sa’id Ibn Ziyad Ibn Qa’id)<br /><br />Marwan (Ibn Muhamad at-Tatari) said that, &quot;I said to Imam Layth Ibn Sa’d al-Misri:<br /><br />Why do you sleep after Asr whilst Ibn Lahi’a narrated a hadith through the chain of<br /><br />From Aqil from Makhul from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Sallam) that<br />Whosoever sleeps after Asr and his intellects disappears then he should only blame himself.<br /><br />Layth Ibn Sa’d responded:<br />I cannot leave that thing which gives me benefit because of a hadith by Ibn Lahi’a from Aqil. (al-Kamil of Ibn Adi 4/1463 and it’s chain is [Sahih])<br /><br />It is known from this that Imam Layth Ibn Sa’d also did not act upon [Da’if] weak hadith which were to do with [Fadha’il] virtues.<br /><br />Note: Ibn Lahi’a is [Da’if] weak and did [Ikhtilat] later, and is a [Mudalis]. And this chain is [Mursal] therefore it is [Da’if] weak.<br /><br />Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said that, <em>&quot;There is no difference on acting upon [Da’if] weak hadith which are Ahkam or Fadha’il because these are all actions to do with the Shar’iah.</em>&quot; (Tabayin ul-Ajab bima ward fi fadha’il rajab pg no.73)<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to mention that there is not even a [Da’if] weak narration about performing a special salah that has 100 rak’at with reciting surah ikhlas 1000 times specifically on the 15th of Sha’ban. These type of narrations are all [Mawdu’] fabricated.<br /><br />Note: Allah the Most High descends to the lowest heaven in the last part of every night just as it is established from mutawatir ahadith in the Sahihayn (Bukhari no.1145 and no.7494, and Muslim no.758) etc. We believe in this and entrust how it happens to Allah, He knows best.<br /><br />And it is not upon me except to advise<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=59">Abu Ubaydah</a> — Sun May 07, 2017 8:42 pm</p><hr />

<strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Relooking at: “Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel: A look at the research of Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai regarding him”</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Compiled, Translated &amp; Annotated<br />Abu Hibban &amp; Abu Khuzaimah Ans</strong>ari<br /><br /> <br /><br />Some brother, Muhmmad Moin has compiled a response to an article of Shaikh Zubair Ali Zai’ Rahimahullah on the narrator Mu’mall bin Isma’il. The article is titled ‘Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel: A look at the research of Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai regarding him,’<br /><br />Without going into the polemics of this ‘looking’ nor trying to address each and every point, I thought it would be somewhat beneficial to shed some light into this looking and the research presented. I do not have much time as I would have liked to address each and every point however this being said, in Sha Allah each and every point has been already addressed in other research, which will, by the permission of Allah be presented in the future.<br /><br />The brother begins by saying<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">“Some brother Raza Hassan has translated an urdu article by Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai proving Tawtheeq of Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel. I had read it in the book ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (1/417) by the author. After comparing the translation and the article present in Ilmi Maqalaat, it is clear to me that the brother has quoted it from the urdu Islamic magazine Al-Hadeeth vol.21. This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing). The title of the article is “Ithbat at-Ta’deel fi tautheeq Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel”<br /><br />Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.<br /><br />Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.<br /><br />There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-</span><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Let us examine some of these points. The reader should be aware that author or writer will always amend and change his works due to new information or understanding, this is well known amongst those who write, especially those who write and research issues pertaining to rijal and Jarh wa’t Ta’dil etc.<br /><br />When this is the case Shaikh Zubair published the said article in his monthly journal, al-Hadith in February 2006 (issue no.21) and we also know the Tahqiqi Ilmi Maqalat volume 1 was printed in 2010, where the treatise is in (1:417-438), giving the Shaikh a total of 4 years to make any necessary changes, retractions and or clarifications if needed and this is not something which is defective, but rather something praiseworthy and highly encouraged as the truth is always beloved to us.<br /><br />Shaikh Zubair Ali also dates the article in the Ilmi Maqalat (1:438) as 14th Sha’ban 1427H which corresponds to September 2006, which therefore shows amendment after approximately 8 months and it appears this is the amended version that was included in the Ilmi Maqalat. Point being there were amendments in a period of 8 months where as 4 years is a very long time and highly likely and very plausible that contents of any article or book can change.<br /><br />Furthermore, in our rebuttal of Abul Hasan Hussain Ahmad’s critique of Shaikh al-Albani’s research on the hadith related to placing hands of the chest in his Sifah Salah, we compiled a response titled, ‘Answering the Lies on Imam al-Albani -The Issue of placing the hands on the Chest – al-Jawab ar-Rabbani Raf al-Kadhibah Anil Imam al-Albani’ which can be accessed here<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-lies-on-imam-al-albani-the-issue-of-placing-the-hands-on-the-chest-al-jawab-ar-rabbani-raf-al-kadhibah-anil-imam-al-albani/">http://www.salafiri.com/answering-the-l ... al-albani/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In it, on p.19 we cite this research of Shaikh Zubair as,<br /><br />“Based upon and abridged from the treatise, ‘Ithbaat ut-Ta’deel Fee Tahqeeq Mu’ammal ibn Ismaa’eel’ (manuscript form) of Shaikh Zubair Alee Za’ee.”<br /><br />Our rebuttal was published in January 2004, ie 2 years before it appeared in the al-Hadith monthly journal, Shaikh Zubair Rahimahullah provided this paper prior to 2006, which was in manuscript form. It was years later when it was finally published in the magazine and much later in the Ilmi Maqalat.<br /><br />The point here is to illustrate the period when this treatise of Shaikh Zubair was first written to the time it was last published with any amendments. We have shown this period at the very least exceeds 6-7 years and also that it is very common and that any individual can appreciate the possibility and need for correction due to a plethora of reasons.<br /><br />Therefore, the authors words, <span style="color: #0000FF">“This same article was later published in ‘Ilmi Maqalaat (collection of Shaykh Zai’s articles) where he retracted a lot of things he claimed previously (this will be notified during the course of this writing)”</span> have no relevance and should not be given any importance except but to understand the norm of changes over a period of time particularly when it is concerning such intricate sciences of hadith and mustalah.<br /><br /> We know as Muslims arrogance and pride are destructive traits which have been severely censured in the Prophetic Ahadith. Shaykh Zubair through his works has shown his retractions and clarifications on possible mistakes or errors he may have made and this is the true sign of scholarship, integrity and trustworthiness. This is not an ayb ie something bad or defective but rather something which should be respected, appreciated and praised.<br /><br />The author, Muhammad Moin, should have noticed on the very last page of the al-Hadith monthly journal (Issue no.21, p.25) and no doubt he would have observed this due to his admittance of referring back to the journal, that Shaykh Zubair has a subheading titled, “Announcing a Retraction” where the Shaykh mentions one of his books was composed for publication and after revising the book he graded a narration to be weak after having graded it Hasan in an earlier issue of the al-Hadith journal (Issue no.4 p.40). Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i said,<br /><br />“Therefore, I retract from my previous research and grading and May Allah forgive (me)” (13-12-2005) (al-Hadith; Issue no.21, p.25).<br /><br />This therefore, shows the Shaykhs methodology in referring and retracting back to the truth and this is the Asal of the Sunni, Salafi and Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />The author goes onto say,<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />“Some people may think why Mu’ammal bin Isma’eel is so much discussed among hardcore muqallids and hardcore ghair-muqallid. There are two reasons for it, Muqallids call him Munkar ul-Hadith because (1) he is the narrator of the tradition which mentions that the Musalli should place his hands over his chest, (2) and he is the narrator of some criticisms of Sufyan Thauri against Abu Hanifa. These are the same two reasons why some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars made Tautheeq of Mu’ammal.”<br /></div></blockquote></span><br /><br />The terminology used is crass. obtuse and well lets just say following bandwagon trends, with the least of the issue being deplorable, grossly incorrect and outrageously divergent from the truth. It is enough to satisfy any reader that Mu’mmal bin Isma’il is a narrator of other ahadith in the various books of the Sunnah. In fact, Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i cites every hadith Mu’mmal narrates which shows the reality is totally different from the two reasons inappropriately cited above.<br /><br />Mu’ammal is a narrator of hadith and reports just as equal as other narrators and the Ahl al-Hadith Scholars most certainly do not have tahazzub or ta’assub for particular issues as the author asserts. The truth of the matter is that the very same scholars have defiantly repelled the staunch and bigoted blind imitation ie taqlid prevalent in common society and popular culture. There are a catalogue of incorrect notions and assertions juxtaposed in the authors words, one example being. “some harsh Ahle Hadith scholars…”<br /><br />Shaykh Zubayr also mentions the other books of hadith and their respective authors who used Mu’ammal ibn Isma’il as a narrator, like Bukhari no.2700, 7083, Tirmidhi no. 415, 672, 1822, 1948, 2145, 3266, 3525, 3906, 3949, Nasai in al-Sughra no.4097, 4589 and Ibn Majah no.2013, 2919, 3017. Bukhari using Mu’ammal holds great value and importance which is perhaps beyond the scope of this reply but in sha Allah it can be expounded upon later.<br /><br />The author continues and says,<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />“Shaykh Zubair Ali Zai has special methodology of analyzing conflicting statements of Jarh and Ta’deel. He counts the number of criticism and praise, and rejects the minority based on majority. This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.<br /><br />There are several problems with his methodology, and we shall see them during the course of this refutation, Insha Allah. After this brief introduction, let us proceed with the article by Shaykh Zai.-“<br /></div></blockquote></span><br /><br />It is well known to the beginner student of knowledge that an author is likely at times to use general or mujmal phrases with the mindset the reader is perhaps familiar with the sciences of hadith since he is reading such issues which revolve around these detailed sciences. It is also known to such elementary students that an author will also sometimes explain his general statements with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation whereas sometimes he will leave his statement general. So for a third party to clutch onto the general statements of an author and ignore his multitude of detailed statements, is in serious need of improvement to present such research.<br /><br />It will also be very lengthy to present all of the detailed statements of Shaykh Zubair in this regard who emphatically holds on to and utilizes the methodology of the Scholars of Hadith in investigating, verifying and grading ahadith and he most certainly did not employ a new or special methodology as the author asserts.<br /><br />Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i says answering a question,<br /><br />“Authentic and weak narrations are of two types. The first type; narrations which are unanimously agreed upon in being authentic or weak.  Hafiz Abu Hatim al-Razi (d.277H) said, “And the agreement of the Ahl al-Hadith on something constitutes evidence.” (Kitab al-marasil p.192 no.703, under the entry of Muhammad bin Muslim al-Zuhri)<br /><br />Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani (d.728H) said, “So when the people of jurisprudence unanimously agree on a statement then is not except but considered the truth and if the Ahl al-Hadith unanimously agree in the authentication of hadith then it is not considered except but the truth.” (Majmu’a Fatawa 1:9-10).<br /><br />So we find accepting a hadith unanimously agreed upon is not an issue of ijtihad but rather the ijma is to be followed.<br /><br />The Second type: The ahadith which are differed over, whether they are authentic or weak, then in such affairs giving precedence to the view of the majority is an issue of ijtihad. One must remember is incumbent to act upon whatever principle is adopted otherwise contradiction in statement and action is hypocritical.<br /><br />Note Well (1): Taj al-Din Abdul Wahhab bin Ali al-Subki (d.771H) wrote, “So if the number of disparagers/criticisers are greater in number, the criticism is given precedence.” (Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil p.50)<br /><br />so we find the narrator who is considered to be disparaged by the majority of the scholars of hadith is also considered to be disparaged according to the later scholars. The authentication and weakening of hadith is an issue of ijtihad. However, this does not mean hanafi’s grade hadith they require to be authentic and render other hadith to be weak. Therefore, it is preferable to give precedence to the position and view of the majority of the scholar of hadith (al-Hadith Issue no.10, Muharram 1426H/March 2005, p.18-19, Fatawa ilmiyyah al-ma’ruf tawdih al-ahkam 2:293-295) End of Shaykh Zubair’s words.<br /><br />My edition of the ‘Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil’ contains the addition of ‘the ones who praise’ “So if the number of criticisers is greater in number than those who praise, then the criticism is given precedence.” (Taj al-Din al-Subki, Qa’idah fi jarh wa’t ta’dil, ed. Abdul-Fattah Abu Guddah, 3rd ed. (Beirut: Dar al-Quran al-Karim, 1400H/1980c) 50)<br /><br />This book is very beneficial and filled with principles pertaining to the science of Jarh wa’t ta’dil and thus the avid reader is recommended to refer to it. So we find some of the scholars from the mutaqadimin generally used the idea of majority for either praise or agreement and even criticism and Shaykh Zubair was not the only one and there are many example of this in the books on the science of hadith and narrators.<br /><br />Some of the earlier scholars like Imam Yahya ibn Ma’in (d.233H) used majority and minority to determine the Dhabt ie precision of narrators and the mistakes of Hammad ibn Salamah, who was a great Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah. Imam Ibn Ma’in rejected the minority of the students of Hammad ibn Salamah over the majority who narrated from him, which was based approximately on 18 narrators. (Ibn Hibban, Kitab al-majruhin minal muhadithin, ed. Hamdi Abdul Majid al-Salafi. (Riyadh: Dar al-Sami’i, 1420H/2000) 1:34-35)<br /><br />The brother went onto say,<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />This seems good, but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.<br /></div></blockquote></span><br /><br />Again this is poor understanding of Shaykh Zubair’s methodology and highly incorrect to present it in this way. Everyone is agreed on the principle of detailed criticism takes precedence over general praise and no one differs with this especially Shaykh Zubair as we will show. Shaikh Zubair’s presented this approach only when there were statements of praise and criticism and neither were detailed or specific and it was thus difficult to ascertain the reliability of the narrator.<br /><br />For example, Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr had a unique methodology in that anyone who is well known to possess knowledge of such affairs (ie hadith) was considered to be upright unless criticised. (al-Tamhid, (Morocco: 1378H) 1:28), Cf. Ibn Kathir, Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith explanation of Dr Abdul Aziz al-Saghir Dukhan as al-Sai’ al-hathith, 2nd ed. (San’a: Maktabah al-jil al-jadid:1421H/2001) 304, Ibn Kathir, Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, explanation Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, al-Ba’ith al-hathith (Alexandria: Maktaba Dar al-Aqidah 1428H/2007) 77)<br /><br />Although this has no relevance to majority of minority point, it does however show the uniqueness of every scholar. Naturally Hafiz ibn Salah answered Hafiz ibn Abdul Barr and said this approach was rudimentary and substandard. (Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddimah, ed. A’ishah Abdur Rahman (Cairo, 1990) 288), Cf. E’la al-Din Maglatai, Islah kitab ibn salah, (Cairo Maktaba Islamiyyah, 1428H/2007) no.90, 149)<br /><br />Moreover, Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi was of the view only one critic is required to disparage a narrator. (Khatib al-Baghdadi, al-Kifayah fi ilm al-riwayah (Cairo, 1988) 84).<br /><br />Again the intent here it so the unique and exclusive views of some of the scholars of hadith of the past ie the mutaqaddimin and therefore singling out Shaykh Zubair for having lone methods needs to be looked at, despite this not being the case as we shall mention. Hafiz Ibn Kathir presents his arguments and puts forth the view that statements of criticisms from these Imams who are experts in this field should be accepted without the reasons for the criticism. He also clarifies if criticism and praise conflict each other, then the criticism has to be detailed. (Ibn Kathir, Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith with al-Sai’i al-hathith, 304-305, al-Ba’ith al-hathith, 78)<br /><br />This is incorrect and the scholars of hadith were not of this view, in fact this view is very unique and exclusive to the one who said it. So the authors statement, <span style="color: #0000FF">“but this was not the methodology of scholars of hadith, not even single of them. Rather they would prefer explained Jarh over general Tautheeq, and reject unexplained Jarh against established Ta’deel.”</span> Should also be applied to Hafiz Ibn Abdul Barr, Imam Ibn Kathir and others and we are sure such examples clearly illustrate our point.<br /><br />Shaikh Hafiz Ibn Ahmad al-Hakami (d.1377H) mentions if there is conflict between criticism and praise, the former is given precedence and this is the preferred view according to the majority of the scholars of research and there is no difference in this whether those who praise and validate number many or a little. Some have argued if the number of scholars praising and validating are greater in number then their praise is to be taken. However, this is incorrect as the one invalidating or criticizing is aware of the hidden defect in the narrator. It should be clear, this applies and refers to detailed criticism. (Hafiz al-Hakami, Dalil arbab al-falah li-tahqiq fan al-istilah, ed. Khalid bin Qasim al-Raddadi (Madinah: Maktabah al-Ghuraba al-Athariyyah, 1414H/1993) 204-205)<br /><br />Hafiz Suyuti, Shaikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Shaikh Adam Eithiopi have also mentioned something similar, even if the ones praising are greater in number. He also cites Imam Khatib al-Baghdadi who mentioned this to be the view of the majority of the scholars. Again, this refers to detailed criticism not if the jarh is mubham. (Asa’afu dhul al-watir bi-sharh nazam al-durrar fil ilm al-athar – Sharh al-fiyyah al-suyuti fi ilm al-hadith (Cairo: Dar ul-Athar lil Nashr wal-Tawdih, 1429H/2008) 1:338-339)<br /><br />Shaikh Adam Ethiopi also said when there is conflict between jarh wa’t ta’dil the criticism takes precedence when it is detailed and praise takes precedence over vague criticism and then he goes into detail regarding the types of critics. (Adam Ethiopi, Aydah al-sabil fi sharh ittihaf al-nabil bi-muhammat ilm al-jarh wa’t ta’dil (Riyadh: Dar ibn al-Jawzi, 1429H) 49+)<br /><br />Shaykh Zubair adds a note to the aforementioned statement of Imam Ibn Kathir and said,<br /><br />“In criticism and praise, the detailed and specific positions are given given precedence over the vague and general positions…” (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, with verification and notes, fn.1, 60)<br /><br />He went onto say, clarifying his position which is in line and in accordance with the methodology of the scholars of hadith, he said,<br /><br />“Benefit (1): – when both criticism and praise are ambiguous or they are both detailed and reconciliation is not possible then the view of the majority of the Muhaddithin is given precedence.” (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, fn.1, 60)<br /><br />Ibn Kathir goes onto ask a rhetorical question, is this (detailed criticism) given precedence?  Or alternatively is the majority view given precedence (over the minority view) or those who are specialists and experts in this field? He answers it himself and says that there is a well known difference of opinion in Usul al-fiqh, issues of fiqh and in the science of hadith and Allah knows best. Then he says, “The statement of a single person whether criticism or praise is sufficient.” (Ibn Kathir, Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith with al-Sai’i al-hathith, 305).<br /><br />Shaykh Zubair also added a note here and said in response to the rhetorical question posed by Hafiz Ibn Kathir that,<br /><br />“The correct view is that if the criticism is detailed it will always be given precedence.” (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, 61)<br /><br />The Shaykh then adds a note further explaining what he means by detailed criticism and when the view of the majority of the scholars of hadith and experts is given precedence. (Zubair Ali Za’i, urdu trans. Ikhtisar ulum al-hadith, fn.1, 61)<br /><br />Shaikh Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami discusses this issue whilst citing the chapter heading, “If a person has criticism and praise, which one is given precedence.” He then goes onto cite three main views. (1) criticism takes precedence over praise, (2) Praise takes precedence over criticism and (3) To give precedence to the position that achieves greater clarity. Then he goes onto cite the statements of the early pious ancestors explaining and evidencing each view.<br /><br />He then brings another chapter titled, “Not every criticism takes precedence over praise.” And then the Shaykh evidences this. Such discussions and points add further information and clarity on these issues, especially for the avid reader and student of the discipline. (Muhammad Dhiya al-Rehman al-A’zami, Darasat fi jarh wa’t ta’dil (Varansi: Jamia Salafiyyah, 1403H/1983) 203-207).<br /><br />The preceding discussion absolves any alleged allegations and or incorrect notions of understanding any reader may have had regarding the precedence of criticism over praise and that Shaykh Zubair Ali Za’i did not have a new methodology in scrutinizing ahadith. Furthermore, that he was upon the methodology of the Ahl al-Hadith in verifying and authenticating hadith<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Apr 20, 2017 11:02 pm</p><hr />

اللهُـمِّ اغْفِـرْ لِحَيِّـنا وَمَيِّتِـنا وَشـاهِدِنا ، وَغائِبِـنا ، وَصَغيـرِنا وَكَبيـرِنا ، وَذَكَـرِنا وَأُنْثـانا. اللهُـمِّ مَنْ أَحْيَيْـتَهُ مِنّا فَأَحْيِـهِ عَلى الإِسْلام ،وَمَنْ تَوَفَّـيْتَهُ مِنّا فَتَوَفَّـهُ عَلى الإِيـمان ، اللهُـمِّ لا تَحْـرِمْنـا أَجْـرَه ، وَلا تُضِـلَّنا بَعْـدَه<br /><br />O' Allāh forgive our living and our dead, those who are with us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our menfolk and our womenfolk. O' Allāh, whomever you give life from among us give him life in Islām, and whomever you take way from us take him away in Faith. O Allāh, do not deprive us their reward and do not send us astray after them.<br /><br />Sahīh ibn Mājah 1/251.

Shaykh Muhammad Sālih al-Uthaymeen said:<br /><br />I do not know of there being anything wrong with a shoe being upside down. But this is a very serious matter for some people.
