<strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Traveling With The Tablighis: Shaykh Salih Al Fawzan</span></strong><br /><br />بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Q: Here there are some brothers who affiliate with Jamaa’at-ut-Tabligh, and quite often they invite us to go out with them. They use as a proof  to claim that they are upon the truth (the fact that) an abundance of people, whether they be non Muslim or otherwise from all over the world, have been guided as a result of them. So how do we respond to this?</span></strong><br /><br />A: We say in response to them; who is it that has been guided to tawheed as a result of them? Is it an individual from the disbelievers, an innovator, or a grave worshiper who consequently abandoned polytheism and repented to Allah (he who now knows tawheed) as a result of them? They only encourage people to repent from sins but they do not stand (clearly and openly) against polytheism ever, nor do they warn against it. Consequently grave worship in their countries is plentiful yet they do not oppose it. So what does this mean? What dawah is this? In addition, they encourage people to repent from sins, yet they introduce them to innovations that they themselves practice.<br /><br />Translated by Najeeb Al Anjelesi<br /><br />Source:  شرح الأصول الستَّة<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source:</span></strong> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pureislaam.com/2015/11/15/traveling-with-the-tablighis-shaykh-salih-al-fawzan/">http://pureislaam.com/2015/11/15/travel ... al-fawzan/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2017 9:59 am</p><hr />
