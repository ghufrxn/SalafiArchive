But only the saying of: Salaam!, Salaam! (greetings of peace)! [56:25-26]<br /><br />And His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">سَلَامٌ قَوْلًا مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ</span></strong><br /><br />It will be said to them: Peace be upon you, a Word from The Lord, Most Merciful. [36:58]<br /><br />And His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُم</span></strong><br /><br />And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, saying: “Peace be upon you.” [13:23-24]<br /><br />As for His Saying:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﻭَﺁﺧِﺮُ ﺩَﻋْﻮَﺍﻫُﻢْ ﺃَﻥِ ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺭَﺏِّ ﺍﻟْﻌَﺎﻟَﻤِﻴﻦ</span></strong><br /><br />And the last of their call will be, “All Praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds!”<br /><br />In it is a proof that Allaah the Most High is the One Who is forever praised, and forever worshiped, and due to that He praised Himself for initiating the creation and for maintaining it, just as He praised Himself at the start of His book, and at the beginning of its revelation, when He – the Most High – said:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺍﻟَّﺬِﻱ ﺃَﻧﺰَﻝَ ﻋَﻠَﻰٰ ﻋَﺒْﺪِﻩِ ﺍﻟْﻜِﺘَﺎﺏَ</span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allah, Who sent down upon His Servant the Book. [18:1]<br /><br />And:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ﺍﻟْﺤَﻤْﺪُ ﻟِﻠَّﻪِ ﺍﻟَّﺬِﻱ ﺧَﻠَﻖَ ﺍﻟﺴَّﻤَﺎﻭَﺍﺕِ ﻭَﺍﻟْﺄَﺭْﺽَ</span></strong><br /><br />All praise is due to Allaah, Who created the Heavens and the Earth. [6:1]<br /><br />And other than that from the verses – mention of which would be lengthy – so He is praised in the beginning and at the end, in this life, and in the Hereafter; in every circumstance.<br /><br />Due to this is has been narrated: “Indeed the people of Paradise will be caused to make tasbeeh (say “subhaanAllaah”, Exalted is Allaah) and tahmeed (say “Alhamdulillaah”, all praise is for Allaah) just as they will be caused to breathe.” [Muslim no. 2835]<br /><br />They will be like this due to what they see from Allaah’s multiplied blessings upon them, these blessings will be repeated for them, and returned to them again and again, increasing limitlessly. They will never come to an end, nor have a fixed duration.<br /><br />So there is no diety that has the right to be worshiped except Him, and no Lord other than Him.<br /><br /><strong>https://saadburbank.com/2014/08/22/99/</strong><br /><br />Share this:</div>
