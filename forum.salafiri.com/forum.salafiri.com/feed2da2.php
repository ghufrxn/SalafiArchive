<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The Abundance of Numbers Is Not Used As a Proof</span></strong><br /><br />Allah The Most High stated:<br /><br />And if you were to obey the majority of those in the Earth, they would lead you astray from the path of Allah. (Al-An’aam:116)<br /><br />The Noble Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy upon him) stated:<br /><br />This verse indicates that the abundance of people (being together) is not to be used as a proof against the truth, nor is the small number of those traversing upon a matter from the affairs a proof that it is other than truth. Rather the reality is opposite of that. Indeed the people of the truth are fewer in number but greater with Allah in status and reward. Rather that which is obligatory (upon the people) is to use the paths which lead to it, (truth or falsehood) as a proof for what is the truth and what is falsehood.<br /><br />Source: Al-Kanz Ath-Thameen Fee Tafseer Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 6/210<br /><br />Translated by Abu Yusuf Khaleefah<br />21st of Rajab, 1436 H (06-10-2015)<br />Masjid Nur Allah, Queens, NYC<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://masjidnurallah.com/2015/07/03/the-abundance-of-numbers-is-not-used-as-a-proof/">http://masjidnurallah.com/2015/07/03/th ... s-a-proof/</a><!-- m --><br />Share this and receive reward.<br /><br /><strong>http://www.salafiri.com/the-abundance-of-numbers-is-not-used-as-a-proof/</strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=61">ابو عبدالرحمز</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2016 11:16 pm</p><hr />
