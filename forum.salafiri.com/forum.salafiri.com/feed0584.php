So if he catches the third Takbeer then he says the Takbeer and recites Al-Faatihah, and when the Imaam says the fourth Takbeer, then he says the Takbeer and sends prayers upon the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). When the Imaam says the Tasleem then he makes the Takbeer and says: ‘O Allaah, forgive him and have mercy on him,’ then he says the Takbeer and says the Tasleem.<br /><br />Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts<br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/14073">http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/14073</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/where-does-one-look-in-the-funeral-prayer-since-there-is-no-prostration-and-how-to-make-up-what-one-misses">http://mtws.posthaven.com/where-does-on ... one-misses</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Watch Video @ <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yA">http://wp.me/p4dlgt-3yA</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Thu Mar 30, 2017 4:03 pm</p><hr />
