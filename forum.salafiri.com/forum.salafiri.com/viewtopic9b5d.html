				<div class="content">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee -rahimahullaah -was asked:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question:</span></strong> “Is it permissible for one who has missed something from the Prayer to stand up to complete what he has missed before the imaam completes the Salutation (tasleem)?”<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Answer:</span></strong> “That is not permissible for him. It is upon him to remain until the imaam has completed the second Salutation. If he gets up before he has completed his Salutation, and he does not go back, then his Prayer becomes a Supererogatory (nafl) [Prayer], and it is upon him to repeat it; because it is obligatory upon one praying behind an imaam to remain along with his imaam until the Prayer of the imaam is completed.”<br /><br /><em>['al-Majmoo`atul-Kaamilah li Mu'allafaatish-Shaikh `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee' (16/125).]</em><br /><br />[Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah]<br /><br />Source: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com/">www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a><!-- w --></div>
