				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">What is Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat?</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong><br /><br />What is Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong><br /><br />It is to have imaan in the Most Perfect Names and Lofty Attributes that Allaah described Himself with in His Book and that which His Messenger (sallallaahualaihi wasallam) described him with, and conveying them as they have been reported without asking how. And Allaah, the Most High, has mentioned affirmation of His Names and Attributes along with negation of asking how they are in many places in His Book.<br /><br />Such as His, the Most High, saying, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“He (Allaah) knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them (in the Hereafter) but they will never compass anything of His knowledge.”</span></strong> (Ta-Ha: 110)<br /><br />He, the Most High, said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</span></strong> (ash-Shuraa: 11)<br /><br />He, the Most High, said, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision. He is al-Latif (the Most Kind), well acquainted with all things.”</span></strong> (al-An’aam: 103)<br /><br />And at-Tirmidhee reported from Ubay ibn Ka’ab that the mushrikeen said to the Messenger of Allaah, when he spoke about their deities, “Tell us about the ancestors of your Lord.” So Allaah, the Most High, revealed, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Say, “He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need.”</span></strong> (al-Ikhlaas: 1-2) The One who, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“Begets not, nor was He begotten.”</span></strong> (al-Ikhlaas: 3) This is because nothing is born except that it dies and nothing dies except that it is inherited, and verily Allaah, the Most High, does not die and is not inherited, <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">“And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.”</span></strong> (al-Ikhlaas: 4) He mentioned that there is no one like or similar to Him.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">al-Haafidh al-Hakamee</span></strong><br /><em>A’laam as-Sunnah al-Manshoorah li I’tiqaad at-Taaifah an-Naajiyah al-Mansoorah</em><br /><br />Translated by Abul Irbaad Abid Zargar<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=301">http://www.fatwaislam.com/fis/index.cfm?scn=fd&amp;ID=301</a><!-- m --></div>
