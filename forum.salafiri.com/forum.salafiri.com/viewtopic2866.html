Don’t bring them into your homes.  Don’t leave them with your children and your wives because they are what hinder from the religion and from the path of Allah, and divert them from being upright and cause them to fall into deviation and misguidance.<br /><br />How numerous are the ones who were misguided and deviated. They deviated and their features changed. Their ways changed and this is evident through their conduct, their sayings and their actions.<br /><br />They are stuck to these means day and night. Their eyes are fixed to these things in these wicked devices. What came?  What happened?<br /><br />All the time… until they have become afflicted by using them all the time… they have become afflicted with addiction…<br /><br />It is mentioned by the experts that those that have fallen into this, becoming afflicted with addiction, they cannot bear to be without it, and this is something apparent.<br /><br />You see them staring at these devices all the time… in his pocket… in his car… all the time… to the extent that he doesn’t talk to the one next to him, or his family or to his children in his house.<br /><br />He’s always with these sites.  Even to the extent that he doesn’t pray – he doesn’t get up to pray!  He’s afraid he’s going to miss something.<br /><br />He doesn’t sleep because he’s afraid to miss something or to present something.<br /><br />This is because he has been afflicted with addiction so he cannot bear to be without it.<br /><br />If only he had avoided it from the beginning, he would have been safe from it.<br /><br />So, have fear of Allah, O slaves of Allah. Protect your religion from these distractions, trials and evils.<br /><br />Know that the best of speech is the book of Allah and the finest of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and the worst of affairs are the newly invented ones and every innovation is misguidance.<br /><br />Stay with the body of Muslims upon the truth because Allah’s hand is upon the Jamaa’ah, and whoever deviated then he deviated in the hellfire.<br /><br />Translated by Abu `Abdullah Naasir Hussain حفظه الله<br /><br />Watch Video @ <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wp.me/p2sNCV-3lZ">http://wp.me/p2sNCV-3lZ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2013/11/03/the-dangers-of-smart-phones-and-social-networking-shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan/">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2013/11/03/t ... l-fawzaan/</a><!-- m --></div>
