<strong><em>Ruling of the woman who wants to remain unmarried</em></strong><br /><br />Ash-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan حفظه الله تعالى  was asked this question:<br /> <br /><strong><em>Q</em></strong>: Is it permissible for a woman to remain unmarried if a man who already has a wife and children seeks her hand in marriage due to the excuse that she wants an individual who is a virgin?<br /> <br /><strong><em>A</em></strong>: It is not permissible for a woman to remain unmarried, this is haraam upon her except if she has a legislated excuse because this (act, not getting married causes the following):<br /> <br />1: It makes her lose out from (one of the biggest) opportunities of life (marriage).<br /> <br />2: Prevents her from having offspring.<br /> <br />3: This (reason) is the worse of (the reasons) which is this (act) exposes her to Fitnah and exposes her to fall into Faahishah, Fornication, because a woman is in need of a man no matter who she may be and no matter how she guards herself (from zinaa). So she is in need of a man due to what Allah has given her of shawah (sexual desires), so this act exposes her to fitnah.<br /> <br />So if it is easy for her to get married to who she likes of a man who does not have (another) wife then it is okay. As for it is not easy then her getting married to a man who has a wife is a thousand times better then her remaining single where she is prevented from being married while it is not known that perhaps there is good in this (man) as a husband even though he has three wives, she can be the fourth. So the fact that she lives with women under the protection of a man who can keep her chaste, and causes her to give birth from him, while him being there for her assistance is better then her remaining single…<br /> <br /><strong><em>Reference: Ahkaam takhusul Marah, page:41-42</em></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Shehzad Sattar</a> — Wed Aug 31, 2016 10:29 pm</p><hr />
