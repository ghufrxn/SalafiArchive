				<h3>The Solution For This Ummah Is Not By Simply Changing The Rulers</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Solution For This Ummah Is Not By Simply Changing The Rulers</span></strong><br /><br />We have an example in Barak Obama, the president of United States of America. The guy who received the Noble peace prize in the very first year of his being elected but could not do anything about gun control and violence in his own country. The guy who is himself a black, but could not do much to remove the racial hatred towards the blacks and other races in his own country. The guy whose party slogan was “Yes we can” (bring about the changes), but what happened? The only change we see is towards the worse as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:<br /><br /><em><ul>❝No time will come upon you but the time following it will be worse than it.❞</ul></em><br /><br />When people went to Anas رضي الله عنه complaining about the wrong they were suffering at the hands of al-Hajjaaj, this when Anas رضي الله عنه narrated to them that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ❝Be patient…❞ (and the rest of the Hadeeth is as mentioned above) [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (7068)]<br /><br />Change does not come by changing the rulers. Change comes when we change ourselves for the better, as Allaah تعالى said:<br /><br /><em><ul>إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ ۗ وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّـهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَالٍ<br /><br />❝{Verily! Allaah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allaah wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector}❞ [Surah al-Ra`d (13): 11]</ul></em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">What we learn here is:</span></strong><br /><br /><ul>1) The good state of the people will not change as long as they are righteous and pious.<br /><br />2) When they turn towards the evil and disobedience, their state changes towards the worse and the blessings of Allaah is taken from them.<br /><br />3) Our sins are our own worst enemies.<br /><br />4) We cannot expect the rulers to be pious while we are ourselves sinning.<br /><br />5) When Allaah decrees His punishment, then there is no turning it back.<br /><br />6) None can benefit us against Allaah, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had said: ❝And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allaah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allaah had already prescribed against you.❞<br /><br />7) Don’t rely on your strength for the desired change, become righteous and ask Allaah for it, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ❝If you ask, then ask Allaah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allaah [alone].❞<br /><br />8) If there is something in the rulers which is not to our likings, then we should be patient and supplicate to Allaah that He guides them or deals with them.</ul><br />Ibn Khaldoon (d. 808 H) mentioned in his Taareekh: “The first one to pray for the Khaleefah on the Minbar was Ibn `Abbaas رضي الله عنهما; he prayed for `Alee رضي الله عنه in his Khutbah while he was in Basrah working as a dignitary for `Alee. He said: “O Allaah! Assist `Alee to be firm upon the truth and make his actions based upon that.” [Taareekh Ibn Khaldoon (1/332)]]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Through your prayers Allaah تعالى will bring about the changes which your swords cannot accomplish.</span></strong><br /><br />- Mu'adh Bin Farooq</div>
