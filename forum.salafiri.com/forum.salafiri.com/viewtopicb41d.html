So much so that blood is spilt and peoples’ wealth &amp; chastity is regarded lawful for taking and evil and corruption is prevalent.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from: ‘Fath al-Bari’ by Ibn Hajr 13/135]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">2 – Rebellions Begin by Criticizing the Rulers</span></strong><br /><br />It is mentioned in ‘Tareekh At-Tabari’ (4/341) that the Jew Abdullaah ibn Saba used to say:<br /><br />‘Begin by criticizing and attacking your leaders. And appear to enjoin the good and forbid evil so the people incline towards you.’<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">3 – The First Type of Nifaaq</span></strong><br /><br />From Abu Darda -radhiallaahu anhu- who said:<br /><br />‘The first Nifaaq (hypocrisy) a person commits is when he criticizes and attacks his leader.’<br /><br /><em>[Collected by al-Bayhaqi in ‘Shu’ab al-Emaan’ 7/48]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">4 – Everyone Participating in Politics</span></strong><br /><br />Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen said:<br /><br />‘Whoever wants the general public to participate in the politics of the leaders of the Muslims, in their opinions, their ideas, then he is far, far, astray. He has left the guidance of the Companions, the guidance of the rightly guided Khulafa and the guidance of the Salaf of the Ummah.’<br /><br /><em>[From ‘The Explanation of Riyadh as-Saliheen’ 6/225]</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">5 – The Way to Free Oneself from the Oppression of the Rulers</span></strong><br /><br />Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani said:<br /><br />‘The way to free oneself from the oppression of the rulers is that the Muslims repent to Allah and correct their ‘Aqeedah, and to train themselves and their families upon the correct Islaam.<br />And the way to be free from their oppression is not like some people have presumed which is armed revolutions against the rulers by way of military coups.<br /><br />Since indeed it is a Bida’ of our current time along with it opposing many texts of the Sharia’ in which there is a command to change themselves and it is necessary to correct the principle to build the foundation of the building upon it.’<br /><br /><em>[Taken from ‘Qamoos al-Bida’ p. 767]</em><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/advice-about-rulers-ruling/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... rs-ruling/</a><!-- m --></div>
