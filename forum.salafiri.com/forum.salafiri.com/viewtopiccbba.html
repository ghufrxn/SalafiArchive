[Tahdheeb At-Tahdheeb 5/439-440/ 7758]<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">SECOND PROOF</span></strong><br /><br />Narrates Anas ibn Maalik That the Messenger of Allaah (Sallalahu Alayhee Was-Sallam) said,  “Every Friday the deeds of my Umaah are presented to me, and the Wrath of Allaah is upon the fornicators severely” [Hilyatal- Auliya (6/79), Kunzul A’amaal 5/318]<br /><br /> This narration is very Weak (Daeef), two Narrators are Majrooh, Ahmad ibn Eesaa ibn Maahaan Ar-Raazee would narrate, fabricated narrations on the virtue of Alee ibn Abee Taalib and Odd (Ghareeb) narrations, the Muhadditheen have made Kalaam on him. [Meezaan al-Ei’tidaal (1/128) and Leesaan al-Meezaan (1/244]<br /><br /> Two more narrations from Anas are brought one about whom Imaam Adiyy mentioned in al-Kaamil [2/124] in its chain is Faraash ibn Abdullah who lost his reliability<br /><br /> And the second narration contains Muhammad ibn Abdul Maalik ibn Ziyaat Abu Salamah Ansaari who would narrate fabricated and forged narrations, Imaam Ibn Taahir called him a Kadhaab.<br /><br /> For details see Silsilah Ahadeeth Ad-Da’eefah of Imaam Al-Albaanee (Rahimahullah) [(no. 975) 2/404-406]<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salafiri.com/are-our-deeds-presented-to-our-dead-relatives/">http://www.salafiri.com/are-our-deeds-p ... relatives/</a><!-- m --></div>
