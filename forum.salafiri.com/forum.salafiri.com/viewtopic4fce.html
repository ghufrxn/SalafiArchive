				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Did The Prophet Mention A Virtue In The Day Of ‘Arafat Falling On A Friday?</span></strong><br /><em>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-Uthaymeen</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> Has anything come from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) regarding the virtue of Hajj being on Friday?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Answer:</span></strong> No. There has not come anything from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) regarding the virtue of Friday coinciding with the Day of ‘Arafat. However, the scholars say that if it coincides with Friday then it contains goodness:<br /><br /><ul><span style="text-decoration: underline">Firstly</span>: The Hajj will be like the Hajj of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam); because the Messenger’s standing at Arafat coincided with Friday.</ul><br /><ul><span style="text-decoration: underline">Secondly</span>: On Friday there is an hour wherein no Muslim slave catches it whilst standing in prayer and asking Allaah for anything except that He will give it to him. Therefore, this is better in terms of being responded to.</ul><br /><ul><span style="text-decoration: underline">Thirdly</span>: The Day of Arafat is an ‘Eid and Friday is an ‘Eid. So if two ‘Eids coincide then this contains goodness.</ul><br />As for that which is widespread from the Hajj on Friday equaling seventy pilgrimages this is not authentic.<br /><br />Translated by Raha ibn Donald Batts<br /><br />Source: <em>Silsilah Al-Liqaa’ Ash-Shahree (no. 34)</em><br /><br />Source/Audio: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mtws.posthaven.com/tag/Arafat">https://mtws.posthaven.com/tag/Arafat</a><!-- m --></div>

				<h3>Fasting On Arafat If It Coincides With Friday Explained by Shaykh ibn Baz [1420H]</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">Fasting on Arafat if it coincides with Friday Explained by Shaykh ibn Baz [1420H]</span></strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> The day of Arafat came on Friday, and I fasted on Friday which was the day of Arafat, but I did not fast on Thursday; so is there any sin upon me?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Shaykh bin Baz:</span></strong> We hope there is no sin upon you. This is because you did not intend to single out this day for fasting; rather you only fasted this day because it was the day of Arafat. But if you would have fasted Thursday along with it, it would have been safer and less doubtful.<br /><br />This is because the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم prohibited singling out Friday for fasting as it relates to the one observing and optional fast. And you were observing an optional fast. Therefore, if you would have fasted Thursday along with it, with would have been safer and less doubtful even if your intention was to fast because it was Arafat. But for the believer to investigate so he can be in agreement with the commands of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is safer and less doubtful. As for fasting (Friday) intending to do so because it is a virtuous day, then this is not permissible because the Messenger prohibited that. But if you fast this day because it is the day of Arafat then we hope there will be nothing upon you. But if the person takes precaution and fast on Thursday along with Friday, this will be safer.<br /><br /><em>Translated by Rasheed ibn Estes Barbee</em><br /><br />Source/Audio: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mtws.posthaven.com/tag/Arafat">https://mtws.posthaven.com/tag/Arafat</a><!-- m --></div>
