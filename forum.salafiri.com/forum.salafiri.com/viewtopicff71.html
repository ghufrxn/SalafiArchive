				<div class="content"><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Question:</span></strong> There is a person who possesses both lawful and unlawful wealth [i.e. his wealth has been acquired by a mixture of Haraam &amp; Halaal methods], is it permissible to eat [take] from his livelihood or not?<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Response:</span></strong> If the source of this person’s wealth is not known then it is not forbidden to eat [take] from him. However, if it is known that this person’s wealth has been acquired unlawfully then it must not be accepted and it must be avoided. If on the other hand it is known that he has a mixture of lawfully and unlawfully acquired wealth and the unlawful amount exceeds that of the lawful amount then you must abstain from eating [taking] from this person, and this is more God [Allah] fearing. And Allah knows best.<br /><br /><em>Reference: Jamiul-Masa’il of Ibn Taymiyah, The Fourth Series – Page 333</em><br /><br /><em>Shaykhul Islaam Taqee ad-Deen ibn Taymiyyah</em></div>
