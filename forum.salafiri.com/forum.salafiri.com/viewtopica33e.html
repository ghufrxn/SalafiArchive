Take your leather socks off and carry them on your shoulder, and take the reins of your she-camel and walk her through the wet ditch?! It does not please me that the people of this country see you like this?”<br /><br />Umar said: “Oh! If only someone other than you Abu Ubaida had said this, I would have made an example of him for the <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Ummah</span></strong> of Muhammad –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam!<br /><br />Indeed, we were the most insignificant of people and Allaah honoured us with Islaam.  No matter how much we seek honour with other than what Allaah has honoured us with, then Allaah will make us the most insignificant of people.”<br /><br />And Hakim said about this hadeeth: “It is <strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Saheeh</span></strong> according to the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim.” And ad-Dhaahbi agreed with him, and the hadeeth is like they have said.<br /><br />In another narration he said: “<strong><span style="color: #0000FF">O Ameer –ul-Mumineen</span></strong>, you will meet the soldiers and the generals of Shaam, and this is your condition?”<br /><br />Umar said: “Indeed we are a people, whom Allaah has honoured with Islaam, so we will never seek honour with other than Islaam.”<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/ahadeeth-regarding-tawheed/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... g-tawheed/</a><!-- m --></div>
