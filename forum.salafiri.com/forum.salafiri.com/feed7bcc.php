And abandoning looking into their innovations. And holding onto the MADHAB of AHL AL-ATHAR from the likes of Abi Abdullah Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, Abi Ubaid al-Qasim bin Salam and al-Shafi’i.

There being a madhab of the people of narration and reports, Athar, which are the narrations and hadith therefore the Madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />4. The aforementioned scholars were upon this way, on the madhab of Ahl al-Hadith.<br /><br />5. In every affair the reports from the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the companions and successors are looked at.</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forum.salafiri.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">AbuKhuzaimahAnsari</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2016 12:34 am</p><hr />
