Imam Ahmad said : “ The one who has memorized the Qur`an (is more befitting as it was the hadeeth of the prophet that the Imam should be the one who knew and understood Qur`an the most)and he should do raf `al yadain because it is the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam).<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">[Ref: Masail Imam Ahmad.
