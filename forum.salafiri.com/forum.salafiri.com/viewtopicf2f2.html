				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">The Language of the People of Paradise</span></strong><br /><em>By Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</em><br /><br /><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em><br /><br />Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- was asked:<br /><br />‘In what language will the people be spoken to on the Day of Resurrection? Will Allaah Ta’ala speak to the people in Arabic? Is it true that the language of the people of Hell-fire will be Persian and the language of the people of Paradise will be Arabic?’<br /><br />He -<em>Rahimullaah</em>- answered:<br /><br />‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the worlds, it is not known in what language the people will be spoken to on that day, nor in which language they will hear the address of the Lord –Jala wa Ula’- because Allaah Ta’ala did not inform us of anything about this, nor did His Messenger-<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.<br /><br />It is not authentic that Persian is the language of the people of the Hell-fire <strong><span style="color: #0000FF"><em>or</em></span></strong> that Arabic is the language of the people who will be in eternal blessing.<br /><br />We do not know of a dispute between the Companions –Radi Allaahu anhum–, rather all of them refrained from this, because speaking about these types of things is from futile speech . . . However, there occurred a dispute between the people who came later so some of them said that: the people will converse in Arabic. Others said: ‘No, the people of Hell-fire will reply in Persian and it is their language in Hell-fire.’<br /><br />Others said: ‘They will converse with Syriac (an Eastern Aramaic language) because it is the language of Adam and from it all other languages branched off.’<br /><br />Others said: ‘No, the people of Paradise will speak Arabic.’<br /><br />There is no basis any of these opinions by those who hold them, neither intellectual nor transmitted, rather it is a claim devoid of evidence and Allaah – <em>Subhana wa Ta’ala</em> – is most Knowledgeable and most Just.’<br /><br /><em>Taken from ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 4/300-301</em><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0000FF">Source</span></strong>: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/the-language-of-the-people-of-paradise/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... -paradise/</a><!-- m --></div>
