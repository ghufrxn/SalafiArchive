Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of the people of the tribe went to the Companions and said:<br /><br />‘Do you have any medicine with you or someone who can recite upon him?’<br /><br />One of them replied: ‘But you did not receive us as your guests. We will not treat your patient with a Ruqqiyah till you fix for us something as wages.’<br /><br />Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The Companion began reciting Soorah Fatiha and spat spittle on the bite till the patient was healed.<br /><br />When the tribe people gave them sheep.<br /><br />The Companions then said, ‘Let’s not take from these sheep till we ask the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and they asked him, the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- laughed and said:<br /><br />‘How did you know that Soorah Fatiha is a Ruqqiyah? Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.’<br /><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhari from the ‘Chapter: Ruqqiyah with the Qur’aan and the Mu’auwidhat’ &amp; Fath al-Bari volume 10 p.195]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">b) Recite Soorah Falaq Soorah Naas and Soorah Ikhlaas</span></strong><br /><br />c) For an illness and before sleeping the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would cup his hands and recite Soorah Ikhlaas, recite Soorah Falaq and Soorah Naas then wipe his hands on his face and all over his body.<br /><br />From Ayesha –Radi Allaahu anha– that ‘the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, during his fatal ailment used to blow (on his hands and pass them) over his body while reciting the Mu’auwidhat (Soorah an-Nas and Soorah al-Falaq).<br /><br />When his disease became aggravated, I used to recite them for him and blow (on his hands) and let him pass his hands over his body because of its blessing.’<br /><br />Ma’mar asked az-Zuhri: ‘How did he use to do Nafth (blow in his hands)?<br /><br />He said: He used to blow on his hands and then pass them over his face.’<br /><br />[Saheeh al-Bukhari from the ‘Chapter: Ruqqiyah with the Qur’aan and the Mu’auwidhat’ &amp; Fath al-Bari volume 10 p.195]<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/what-to-recite-on-a-sick-person/">https://followingthesunnah.wordpress.co ... ck-person/</a><!-- m --></div>
