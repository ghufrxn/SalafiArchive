				<div class="content"><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">My wife or my mother, which one should I take for Hajj?</span></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong><br /><br />I intended to make Hajj this year, me and my wife; and my mother tried to go with us. But I refused because I am not able to help my mother and my wife at the same time. Am I sinning by refusing her request?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />It is befitting that you make Hajj with your mother and delay the Hajj with your wife because kindness to your mother is obligatory upon you; the only exception is if your mother allows you to leave her and to make Hajj with your wife, if so there is no problem with this.<br /><br /><em><strong>Fatwa by Sheikh Fawzan</strong></em><br /><br />Translated by Rasheed Barbee<br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mtws.posthaven.com/">http://mtws.posthaven.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
