Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeeelaanee (d. 561H) said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He said, "<b>Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish.   And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever</b>." (Ar-Rahman 55:26-27). <u>And He is in the direction of above (al-uluww), ascended over His Throne</u>, possessing the dominion, His knowledge encompassing [all] the things. "<b>To Him ascends the goodly word and the righteous action raises it (the goodly word)</b>." [Faatir 35:10]. "<b>He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning</b>." [Sajdah 32:5]</div>    <P>
<b>Source:</b> Ghunyat ut-Taalibeen of Shaykh <a href='tags/abdul-qaadir-al-jeelaanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee</font></a> (1/146).    <P>
<u>Note:</u> It is not from the way of the Salaf to utilize the word "jihah" in the subject of Allaah's uluww, rather they only expressed the words found in the revelation, and when the Jahmiyyah and Mu'tazilah began to deny there is a Lord above the Heaven, above the Throne, the Imaams of the Salaf began to add words of clarification such as "baa'inun min khalqihi" (separate from His creation) and "bi dhaatihi" (with His Essence) because the situation needed such a clarification on account of the doubts being spread by the deviants. And as for the word "jihah" then it is an ambiguous word by which both a true and false meaning could be in intended - thus it is best to avoid such words and stick only to the words found in the revelation which are that Allaah is above the heaven, above His Throne, ascended over it in a manner that befits His Majesty. <P>
