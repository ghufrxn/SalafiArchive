Shaykh Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeeelaanee (d. 561H) said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And from their saying [the Saalimiyyah] is that Allaah is in every place and [that] there is no difference between the Throne and [what] is other than it of the [various] places. And in the Qur'an is rejection of them [them being declared liars]. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic said: "<b>Ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne</b>." And it was not said, "...ascended above the earth..." and nor upon the interiors of mountains. And mountains and other than them are from the places (amkinah).    <P>
And this is the end of what is associated with [the affair of] i'tiqaad (belief) and usool (foundations) from the aspect of (mere) indication and conciseness.</div>    <P>
