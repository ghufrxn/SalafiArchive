<b>Ishaaq bin Raahawaih, the Scholar of Khurasaan (d. 237H)</b>    <P>
Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee (d. 280H) said: I said to <a href='tags/ishaaq-bin-raahawaih.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ishaaq bin Raahawaih</font></a>, "His, the Most High's saying, 'There is no secret gathering of three, except that He is the fourth...', how do we speak regarding it? He said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Wherever you may be, He is closer to you than your jugular vein, but He is separate and distinct from His creation (<u>baa'inun min khalqihi</u>)</div>    <P>
Then he (Ishaaq) mentioned from [Abdullaah] Ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181H), his saying:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He is over His Throne, separate and distinct from His creation (<u>baa'inun min khalqihi</u>).</div>    <P>
Then he (Ishaaq) said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The most apparent and manifest thing in that regard is His, the Most High's saying:    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> ar-Rahmaan ascended above the Throne (Taha 20:5). </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>  </div>    <P>
It was reported by al-Khallaal in "as-Sunnah" from Harb.    <P>
<b>Source:</b> "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" of adh-Dhahabee, (p. 191).    <P>
Note: Harb bin Ismaa'eel al-Kirmaanee is from the associates of Imaam <a href='tags/ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a>. <P>
