The hadeeth of <a href='tags/muqaatil-bin-hayyaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muqaatil bin Hayyaan</font></a> from <a href='tags/ad-dahhaak.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>ad-Dahhaak</font></a> (d. 105H) regarding His, the Most High's saying, "<b>There is no secret counsel of three except that He is the fourth of them</b>..." that he [ad-Dahhaak] said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He is above the Throne, and His knowledge is with them.</div>    <P>
And in a wording:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He is above the Throne, and His knowledge is with them.</div>    <P>
And in a wording:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He is above the Throne and His knowledge is with them wherever they may be.</div>    <P>
It was related by Abu Ahmad al-Assaal, and Abu Abdullaah bin Battah, and Abu Umar bin Abdul-Barr with good chains of narration. And Muqaatil is thiqah (trustworthy) an Imaam.    <P>
<b>Source:</b> "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" of Imaam adh-Dhahabi, (p. 133)    <P>
<b>Note:</b> Today's Asha'ris are the followers of the later Ash'aris who are those from al-Juwaynee (d. 478H) onwards - and they are upon the creed of the Philosphers like Ibn Sina the kafir, (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>), the Jahmiyyah and the Mu'tazilah who say     <P>
<div class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Allaah is neither within the creation nor outside of it</i></div>    <P>
And they are not able to bring authentically transmitted statements from any of the Salaf prior to 300H to argue for and justify their Jahmite belief of negating there is a Lord above the heaven. <P>
