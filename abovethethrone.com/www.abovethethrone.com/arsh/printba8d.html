<p>And Abul-Qasim Sulayman bin Ahmad at-Tabarani brings in "Kitaab us-Sunnah", as does adh-Dhahabi in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p.132-133) from al-Abbaas bin Fudayl al-Asfaatee from Sulayman bin Harb who said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/uluww-131h-p132-no112-ayyub-sakhtiyaani.gif border=0>    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I heard <a href='tags/hammaad-bin-zayd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hammaad bin Zayd</font></a> (b. 98H, d. 179H) (saying): I heard Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H), the Mu'tazilah were mentioned, so he said: "The central axis of the Mu'tazilah is that they want to say there is nothing above the heaven".</div>    <P>
And adh-Dhahabi, in his "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" commented on this saying:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This isnaad is like the sun in its clarity and like a pillar in its affirmation from the head and scholar of the people of Basrah (i.e. Hammaad bin Zayd).</div>    <P>
<b>Source:</b> Adh-Dhahabi in "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" (p.132-133)    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> And the Mu'tazilah were upon the deen of the Jahmiyyah in negating there is a Lord above the heaven, and we have documented elsewhere that the Mu'tazilah were also heavily involved in debating with the Indian Materialist Philosophers during the time of Haroon ar-Rasheed - <a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?dhpom>see here</a>. And they took up the form of argument of Jahm bin Safwaan against the Indian Materialist Philosophers (of hudooth ul-ajsaam) but they refined it further, by adopting the "atomism" of some of the Greek Philosophers, so they adopted the notions of "al-jawhar al-fard" (the individual particle" and "al-juz alladhee laa yatajazza'" (the indivisible particle) into their creed in order to refine and strengthen that same proof - and then the Ash'ariyyah simply adopted that from Mu'tazilah thereafter. And all of this was the "ilm ul-kalaam" that the Salaf condemned and rebuked.    <P>
But this saying of Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani was said before or around 131H which is when Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani died, and this is because the Mu'tazilah adopted the deen of the Jahmiyyah of ta'teel of Allaah's uluww and Allaah's sifaat, on account of that intellectual proof of <a href='tags/hudooth-ul-ajsaam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hudooth ul-Ajsaam</font></a>.    <P>
And reflect upon what Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani, that great and pious scholar, said about the Mu'tazilah in his time, and <a href='tags/hammaad-bin-zayd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hammaad bin Zayd</font></a> who narrated this from Ayyub, and he was no more than 30 years of age, he knew this for a whole fifty years, and he knew what the Jahmites and the Mu'tazilah were intending.     <P>
And we see that <a href='tags/hammaad-bin-zayd.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hammaad bin Zayd</font></a> (d. 179H) used to say what he had heard from Ayyub as-Sakhtiyaani (d. 131H) as is reported by Imaam ad-Dhahabee, in Mukhtasar al-uluww (p.146):    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Sulayman bin Harb said: I heard Hammad bin Zayd (d. 179H) saying: "They are circulating around [the issue of] of wanting to say that there is no deity above the heaven". He means the Jahmiyyah.</div>    <P>
So the Salaf walillaahil-hamd were wise to these Jahmites and Mu'tazilites, and all praise is due to Allaah who has preserved His deen through the speech of the pious Salaf.    <P>
