<b>Abu Amr Abdur-Rahmaan bin Amr al-Awzaa'ee, The Scholar of ash-Shaam in his time (d. 157H)</b>    <P>
Abu Abdullaah al-Haakim reported from al-Awzaa'ee:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We - whilst the Taabi'oon (Successors) were widespread - used to say, "Indeed, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, is <u>above His Throne</u>, and we believe in whatever has been mentioned in the Sunnah of His Attributes.</div>    <P>
Al-Bayhaqi related it in his book, "al-Asmaa was-Sifaat" (p. 408).    <P>
And Abu Ishaaq ath-Tha'labee, the Mufassir (Exegete) said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Al-Awzaa'ee was asked regarding His, the Most High's saying: "<b>Then He ascended over the Throne</b>", so he said: "He is <u>over His Throne</u>, just as He described Himself."</div>    <P>
And al-Waleed bin Muslim asked the Imaam, Abu Amr al-Awzaa'ee about the ahaadeeth of the Attributes and he said:     <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>"Pass them on just as they have come".</div>    <P>
And also from the speech of this Imaam [is]:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Upon you is [to follow] the tracks of those (Salaf) who have preceded, even if the people reject you, and beware of the opinions of men even if they beautify it for you with speech.</div>    <P>
