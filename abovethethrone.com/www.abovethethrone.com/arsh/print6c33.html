<b>Abu Ma'mar al-Qatee'ee al-Haafidh (d. 236H)</b>    <P>
Ibn Abee Haatim quotes in his work from Yahyaa bin Zakariyyaa bin 'Eeesaa from Abu Shu'ayb Saalih al-Harawee from Abu Ma'mar Ismaa'eel bin Ibraaheem that he said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The final (end-result) of the saying of the Jahmiyyah is: That there is no deity <u>above the heaven</u>.</div>    <P>
Abu Ma'mar is from the Shaykhs of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. And al-Bukhaaree has also narrated, through him, from another man. He died in the year 236 and he was from the Imaams of the Sunnah.    <P>
