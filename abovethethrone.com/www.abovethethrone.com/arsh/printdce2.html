<b>Sunayd bin Daawood al-Maseesee, the Haafidh (d. 226H)</b>    <P>
Abu Haatim ar-Raazee said: Abu Imraan at-Tarsoosee narrated to us, saying:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I said to Sunayd bin Daawood, "Is He, the Mighty and Majestic, <u>above His Throne</u>, separate and distinct from His creation (<u>baa'inun min khalqihi</u>)? He said, "Yes."</div>    <P>
I (adh-Dhahabee) say: Sunayd has a large tafseer and I have seen all of it with the asaaneed (chains of narration). And his madhhab in the Attributes (of Allaah) is the madhhab of the Salaf. He died in 226H.    <P>
