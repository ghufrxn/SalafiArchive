<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>From <a href='tags/abu-hurairah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Hurairah</font></a> (radiyallaahu anhu) from the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), who said: "Whoever believes in Allah and His Messenger, establishes the prayer and fasts the month of Ramadan will rightfully be granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah's cause or remains in the land where he is born." The people said, "O Allah's Messenger! Shall we inform the people with this good news?" He said, "Paradise has one-hundred levels which Allah has reserved for the Mujaahideen who fight in His cause, and the distance between each of two levels is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask Allah (for something), ask for Al-Firdaws which is the middle-most and highest part of Paradise. Above it is the Throne of ar-Rahmaan, and from it originate the rivers of Paradise.</div>    <P>
Al-Bukhaaree said towards the end of his Saheeh:     <P>
