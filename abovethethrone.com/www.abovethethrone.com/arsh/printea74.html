Imaam Ibn Baz was asked the following question (<a href="../../abovethethrone.com/arsh/assets/audios/bin-baz-jahmee.mp3">mp3</a>):    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This questioner says: What is your opinion regarding the one who says that investigating into the essence of Allaah is shirk and is from philosophical knowledge and says that if you have not seen Allaah then how you can specify his direction. So what is your advice to him and to me because I am a student and I study with him and I have advised him and he said: I believe in my speech and I am not a doubter.</div>    <P>
To which Imaam Ibn Baz replied:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Do not study with him, my advice is that you do not study with this hardcore Jahmite, this Jahmite, do not study with him. All&#257;h, it is known, he is above the heaven, in &#703;uluww, above the Throne. The one who rejects this is a k&#257;fir, we ask All&#257;h for safety. And as for investigating into the attributes, then Allaah has explained His attributes, as for this being prohibited, this has no basis. </div>    <P>
Then when asked what is to be done with such a person, the Shaykh explains that his affair should be referred to the responsible parties in the University, to the mudeer or whoever is in charge.    <P>
