<b>Al-Qa'nabee, that Imaam (d. 221H)</b>    <P>
Banaan bin Ahmad said:     <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We were with <a href='tags/al-qanabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Qa'nabee</font></a> (rahimahullaah) and he heard a man amongst the Jahmiyyah saying: "ar-Rahmaan 'alal Arsh istawlaa" (ar-Rahmaan conquered the Throne). So <a href='tags/al-qanabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Qa'nabee</font></a> said:     <P>
<blockquote>Whoever does not hold with certain belief that ar-Rahmaan indeed ascended over the Throne as it occurs and is settled in the hearts of the generality (of the people) is a Jahmee.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Abdul-Azeez al-Qaheetee related them both in his works.    <P>
And the intent behind the "generality (of the people)", is the generality of the people of knowledge, as we explained in the biography of <a href='tags/yazeed-bin-haaroon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yazeed bin Haaroon</font></a>, the Imaam of the people of Waasit. And <a href='tags/al-qanabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Qa'nabee</font></a> was from the Imaams of guidance, until some of the Huffaadh exaggerated in him and made him superior to Maalik [bin Anas], the Imaam. He (<a href='tags/al-qanabee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Al-Qa'nabee</font></a>) died in 221H at some eighty odd years of age, and he is the greatest of the Shaykhs of Muslim [the compiler of hadeeth], absolutely.    <P>
