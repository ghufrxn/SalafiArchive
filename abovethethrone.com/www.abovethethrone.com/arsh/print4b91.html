<div class="articleContent">
<p>He is Abu Ibraaheem, Ismaa'eel bin Yahyaa, bin Ismaa'eel bin Amr bin Muslim <a href='tags/al-muzanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muzanee</font></a> al-Misree and he is the student of Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee. He was born in 175H and died in 264H. His shaykhs include Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee, Nu'aym bin Hammaad, Alee bin Ma'bad and Asbagh bin Naafi'. His students include Abu Bakr bin Khuzaimah  (d. 311H), Abu Ja'far <a href='tags/at-tahawi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-<a href="tags/tahawi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Tahawi</font></a></font></a> (d. 321), Zakariyyaa bin Yahyaa as-Saajee (d. 307H).    <P>
This creed of <a href='tags/al-muzanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muzanee</font></a> is taken from the printed edition of his risaalah "Sharh us-Sunnah" (tahqeeq Jamaal Azzoon, 1st edition, 1995CE) and it is taken from three manuscripts:    <P>
<ul><li>From a collection of manuscripts  from the Maktabah of Shaheed Alee Pasha in Turkey, photos of which are amongst the manuscripts of the Islamic University of Madinah, no. 1694, and it has its full chain of narrators to <a href='tags/al-muzanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muzanee</font></a>.    <P>
<li> That which is included by Ibn al-Qayyim in "Ijtimaa' Juyoosh al-Islaamiyyah" and adh-Dhahabee in "al-Uluww"    <P>
<li>That which is found in the library of Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree consisting of four pages and 29 lines, and it has its full chain of narrators to <a href='tags/al-muzanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muzanee</font></a>.  </ul>    <P>
This is photo of the first manuscript:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/muzanee-e.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
And this is of the third manuscript:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/muzanee-b.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Al-Muzanee on al-Uluww and <a href='tags/al-istiwaa.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Istiwaa</font></a> and a Refutation of the Jahmiyyah, Mu'tazilah and Later [Jahmite] Asha'ris</font>    <P>
Al-Muzanee said at the opening of his treatise:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/muzanee-c.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>High, over His Throne [in His Majesty, with His Essence], and He is close to His creation with His knowledge. His knowledge has encompassed (all) the affairs, and the preceding decree (maqdoor) has He enforced. [And He is the Generous, the Forgiving], [and] "<b>He knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal</b>." (Ghafir 40:19)</div>    <P>
And further into the treatise he said:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/muzanee-d.gif border=1 border=0>    <P>
Which translates as:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>High over His Throne, separate and distinct from His creation, existent, not non-existent or absent.</div>    <P>
So this is the aqeedah of <a href='tags/al-muzanee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muzanee</font></a> (rahimahullaah) regarding al-Uluww and it is the unanimously agreed upon aqeedah of the entirety of the Salaf and it is not possible for anyone to bring an aqeedah that opposes this prior to 400H except from the Jahmite Atheists and misguided Mu'tazilah and the likes of Ibn Sina (d. 429H) the Kafir who said, "<i>Allaah is neither within the universe nor outside of it</i>" (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/?mrsit>see here</a>), or from those later Ash'arites who abandoned the Kullaabi creed of affirming Allaah is above His Throne, with His Essence, which is what the early Kullaabi Ash'arites were upon (<a href=http://www.asharis.com/creed/series/the-creed-of-the-early-ashari-scholars-differs-from-the-later-jahmite-ashari-scholars.cfm>see here</a>).    <P>
