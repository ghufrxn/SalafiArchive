Al-Hasan bin Uthmaan informed us, saying: Alee bin Muhammad bin az-Zubayr informed us, saying: Ibraaheem bin Abil-Anbas narrated to us, saying: Ya'laa bin Ubayd narrated to us from Sufyaan from Abu Haashim from Mujaahid, who said: It was said to <a href='tags/ibn-abbaas.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Abbaas</font></a>, "There are some people who speak with [the rejection] of al-Qadr!". So he said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>They reject the Book. If I was to grab the hair of one of them, I would cut it off. Indeed Allaah the Mighty and Majestic was <u>above His Throne</u> before He created anything, then He created the creation. So He wrote whatever would happen until the Day of Judgement and indeed the people proceed upon an affair that has already been concluded.</div>    <P>
