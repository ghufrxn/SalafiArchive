The Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah: That the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The Angels take successions regarding you, the angels through the night and the angels through the day. They gather [at the time of] the Fajr prayr and the Asr prayer, then those who remained with you through the night <u>ascend up to Him</u> and He asks them - and He is most-knowledgeable of them (his servants) - "How have you left my servants?" And they (the angels) say, "We came to them and they were praying, and we left them and they were praying".</div>    <P>
The hadeeth is agreed upon (by both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim).    <P>
<b>Source:</b> "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" of Imaam adh-Dhahabee, p. 83.    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> This hadeeth is also a proof for the attribute of "kalaam" (speech) for Allaah, the Most High, since Allaah says to the Angels, "How have you left my servants?"   <P>
