From <a href='tags/masrooq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Masrooq</font></a>, that whenever he narrated from <a href='tags/aaishah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Aa'ishah</font></a>, would say:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>As-Siddeeqah [Aa'ishah] Bint as-Siddeeq [Abu Bakr] narrated to me, the beloved [Aa'ishah] of the beloved [the Prophet] of Allaah, the one who was declared innocent from above the seven heavens.</div>    <P>
Its isnaad is saheeh.    <P>
<b>Source:</b> "Mukhtasar al-Uluww" of Imaam adh-Dhahabi, (p. 128)    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The Jahmiyyah make ta'weel of the likes of these types of narrations and they say that it does not mean Allaah is above the Throne, but that it is where rulings come from, and this is similar to when they claim about the ahaadeeth of Allaah's descent (in a manner that befits Him), and they say it is His knowledge or His mercy that descends, and as is mentioned by some of the Scholars, if you ask them "From whom does it descend?" They have no answer. <P>
