So Yoosuf bin Moosaa al-Qattaan, the Shaykh of Abu Bakr al-Khallaal, said: It was said to Abu Abdullah (<a href='tags/ahmad-bin-hanbal.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ahmad bin Hanbal</font></a>): "Allaah is above the seventh heaven, over His Throne, separate and distinct (baa'in) from His creation, and His power and knowledge are in every place?" He said:    <P>
<div class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Yes, He is over His Throne, and nothing escapes His knowledge.</div>    <P>
<u>Note:</u> This al-Qattaan is thiqah (trustworthy) from the Shaykhs of al-Bukhaaree. He died in 253H, al-Khallaal heard from him, and the isnaad is saheeh.    <P>
