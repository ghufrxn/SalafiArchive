<p><blockquote>Ignorant journalists are <b>a dime a dozen</b> these days where telling lies (whether in ignorance or deliberately) in the course of writing about national security, geopolitics,  <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> and <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> has become an easy art to develop. The offspring of Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab, such as Abd al-Lateef bin Abd al-Rahmaan bin Hasan refuted and stood up against <b>the Kharijite movements</b> which appeared during their time from amongst the Persians or Arab tribes and made clear their departure from the foundations of Islam and its <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/shariah-bj.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shariah</font></a></font></a>, exposed their ignorance and exonerated Shaykh Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab from these matters.  More information on this to follow inshaa'Allaah. In the 20th century, the writings of Sufi, Ash'ari, Maturidi thinkers such as <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/abu-ala-mawdudi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu A'la Mawdudi</font></a></b> and <b><a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a></b> gave rise to the extremist ideology of the Kharijite terrorists and this influence spread to other Muslim lands. Again, this has been oppressively ascribed to Ibn Abd al-Wahhaab and also <a href='tags/ibn-taymiyyah-ik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-taymiyyah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Taymiyyah</font></a></font></a>. There are many cheap "Walmart" journalists out there who believe its not necessary to read credible, unbiased and factual academic publications first so as to avoid spouting lies and misinforming millions.    <P>
Also refer to the following articles:  <ul>  <li> <b>Eight Arrested as Kingdom Busts 'IS Terror' Cell</b> - (<a href=index2a31.html?tvtcgir>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Salafi Scholar Abdullah Al-Najmi on <a href='tags/isis-mt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a> and Al-Nusrah:</b> Misguided Groups of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> Supported by External Foes to Disfigure Islam - (<a href=index2377.html?sxepqhc>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Salafi Scholar Shaykh Abdul-Muhsin  Al-Abbaad:</b> On the Alleged Khilafah of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi (<a href='tags/isis-mt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a>) - (<a href=indexd355.html?onqhyqq>see here</a>)  <li> <b>Shaykh Salih Al-Suhaymee on <a href='tags/isis-mt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a> (Daish) and the Alleged Khilafah:</b> Treacherous <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-bk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> - (<a href=indexc8ab.html?nycmqzd>see here</a>)  </ul>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Saudi Arabia had not and would not support or fund criminals who have unleashed a reign of terror in many areas of the region, said Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf, the Saudi ambassador to the United Kingdom.    <P>
Responding to an article by David Gardner in The Financial Times of London, entitled, "Look beyond Saudi Arabia for Sunni leadership," Prince Mohammed said: "The writer?s extraordinary claim that Saudi Arabia is 'exporting tanker-loads of quasi-totalitarian religious dogma and pipelines of <a href='tags/jihadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadi</font></a> volunteers' is wrong."    <P>
He said Saudi Arabia had not and did not support or fund the murderers who have formed under the banner of the Islamic State.  "We do not and have not supported or funded 'militant jihadism' of any kind," he said. "Indeed, we have stood firmly against it and urged the international community to stand with us."    <P>
Gardner wrote in his article that "Jihadi <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> does present a threat to the Kingdom, but in doctrinal terms it is hard to see in what way it deviates from <a href='tags/wahhabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Wahhabi</font></a> orthodoxy, with its literalist and exclusivist rendering of Sunni Islam."    <P>
Prince Mohammed responded by asking what "Wahhabi orthodoxy" was.  "We are not <a href='tags/wahhabis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>wahhabis</font></a>, we are <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>," he explained. "Wahhabism is a convenient label dreamt up by the media to describe extremist movements ranging from the Taleban in Afghanistan to the <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a> network and now the terrorist <a href='tags/isis-mt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a> in <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a>."    <P>
These movements did not even faintly correspond to the teachings of Sheikh Muhammad Abdul Wahab, who was a well-traveled, scholarly jurist of the 18th century, said the prince. He insisted that <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> adhere to the values of the Holy <a href='tags/quran.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qur'an</font></a> and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which includes the maximum preservation of human life.    <P>
The ambassador reminded Saudi-bashers that the UN Counterterrorism Center was established in Riyadh with the financial support of $100 million from the Saudi government and that this year, the support had been increased by a further $100 million.    <P>
"We have been, and are, fighting <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> within our own borders daily, indeed hourly. Any and all Saudis found to be supporting or funding these murderous evil groups, which are outlawed in Saudi Arabia will be arrested," he said.  Prince Mohammed said it was worth mentioning in the light of the current crisis that in 2003, before the war in <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a>, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal warned: "If change of regime comes with the destruction of <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a>, then you are solving one problem and creating five more problems."    <P>
Saudi nationals shared the ambassador's response on the social media and condemned the campaign of calumny against their country.  "There is a vicious campaign against Saudi Arabia by the ill-informed Western media," said Seif M. Al-Qahtani, a blogger.    <P>
"It seems the Westerners are not reading what is appearing in our media and what is being said from the pulpits of our mosques. These <a href='tags/isis-mt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a> terrorists are being disparaged by one and all for bringing a bad name to our pristine religion," Al-Qahtani added.</blockquote>    <P>
