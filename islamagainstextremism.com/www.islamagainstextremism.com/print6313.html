<p><div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The September 9/11 attacks on the World Trade towers were of no real strategic benefit to the evil <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a> claimed to have been behind them such as <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> and his followers - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx>see here first</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?owscq>then here second</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss>then here third</a>, in that order, for undeniable proof that their likes have been spoken of very severely in the Prophetic texts and in some instances declared "<b>dogs of hellfire</b>" despite their appearance of piety). Nor were these attacks of any strategic benefit to the generality of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and their lands. Much has come to light over the past ten years leading to the majority of well-informed people in all nations across the world questioning and no longer having faith in the official story, despite incessant attempts by the corporate media machine to protect it by airing regular hit-pieces. Here we reproduce some of the statements issued by Muslim Scholars following the events, or in relation to the events, outlining the Islamic position on such terrorist activities.</blockquote></div> <P>




<p>Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Aal ash-Shaikh made an official statement on the events in New York, USA, of September 11, 2001, shortly after their occurrence:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>All praise is due to the Lord of the Worlds, the successful end is for the pious, and prayers and peace be upon the noblest of Prophets and Messengers, and upon his family, and his companions.   To proceed:     <P>
Due to abundant questions and enquiries that have been brought to us concerning what has happened in the United States of America a few days ago, and concerning the Sharee'ah position towards it, and whether the religion of Islaam affirms the likes of these actions or not, I say, seeking aid and assistance from Allaah, the Unique, the Overpowerer, that Allaah, free is He from all imperfection, has bestowed upon us the favour of this Islamic religion and has made it a complete legislation, a perfect and all-inclusive one which is beneficial for all times, and places and all situations, for all individuals and groups of individuals. It invites towards rectification and uprightness and justice and goodness, and also the removal of polytheism, and [removal of] evil, oppression, injustice and deceit.     <P>
And it is from the greatest of favours of Allaah upon us, we the Muslims, that He has guided us to this religion, and has made us its followers and helpers. Hence, a Muslim is cultivated by the legislation of Allaah, a follower of the Sunnah (the way) of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), and one who remains upright and steadfast upon this religion - he is the one who will be the saved Muslim in this life and the Hereafter.     <P>
As for what has happened in the United States of America of very dangerous occurrences, on account of which thousands of souls have passed away, on account of actions that the Islamic Sharee'ah (legislation) does not sanction, and which are not from this religion, and these actions do not agree with the spirit and foundations of the legislation from numerous angles:     <P>
<u>The first:</u> Verily, Allaah, free is He from all imperfections, has commanded justice, and is based upon justice that the Heavens and the Earth stand (i.e. operate, exist), and it is on account of this justice that the Messengers were sent and the Books were revealed. Allaah the free from all imperfections, said, "<b>Verily, Allaah commands with justice and benevolence, and the giving of near relatives (in charity) and He forbids from obscene and evil deeds, and oppression. He cautions you, that perchance you may remember</b>." And He also says, "<b>We have indeed sent Messengers with clear proofs and we have revealed with them, the Book and the Balance, so that the people may abide by justice</b>". And Allaah has judged and decreed that one soul cannot bear the burden of another soul, this due to the perfection of Allaah's justice, free is he from imperfection. He said, "<b>And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another</b>".     <P>
Indeed, Allaah, free is He from all imperfections has forbidden oppression on His own self, and He has also declared it forbidden for his servants, as he has said in the Hadeeth Qudsee, "<i>O My servants, indeed I have forbidden oppression upon Myself and I have also made it forbidden amongst yourselves, hence to not oppress each other</i>". And this is general for all of the servants of Allaah, both the Muslims amongst them and the Non-Muslim, and it is not permissible for any one of them to be unjust to another, and nor for him to oppress him, even if it is in the presence of hate and dislike. Allaah, free is He from all imperfections says, "<b>O you who believe. Be of those who stand up to Allaah, as witnesses of justice. And let not the hatred of a people make you swerve away from justice towards them. Verily, be just and that is closer to piety</b>." Hence, even hatred and dislike do not permit the commission of injustice and oppression, from a legislative point of view.     <P>
Based upon what has preceded, it is obligatory for all of us to know - both states and societies, Muslims and Non-Muslims, a number of important matters:     <P>
<div style="margin-right:25px;"><ol><li>  That these matters that have taken place in the United States and whatever else is of their nature of plane hijackings and taking people hostage or killing innocent people, without a just cause, this is nothing but a manifestation of injustice, oppression and <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a>, which the Islamic Sharee'ah does not sanction or accept, rather it is expressly forbidden and it is amongst the greatest of sins.     <P>
<li> That the Muslim who learns the details of his religion, and who acts upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) does not allow himself to fall into the likes of these actions, due to what they contain of exposing oneself to the wrath of Allaah, and then what results from them of harms and corruption (upon the earth).     <P>
<li> It is obligatory upon the Scolars of the Muslim Ummah that they explain the truth concerning the likes of these affairs (i.e. terrorist attacks) and that they make clear to the world at large that the Sharee'ah of Allaah and the religion of Islaam does not sanction these types of actions, ever.     <P>
<li> It is upon the media outlets and whoever is behind them, from amongst those who make accusations against the Muslims and who strive to revile this noble and upright religion, and describe it with that which it is free from, all in order to kindle tribulation and to harm the reputation of Islaam and the Muslims and to separate the hearts and constrict the chests - it is obligatory upon them to restrain from this misguidance and to realise that every sane and just person knows of the details of Islaam, and knows that it is not possible for him to describe it with these descriptions, and that he cannot make these types of accusations against it, this is because on account of the passing of history, the nations have not known the followers of this religion, and its adherents except to be those who fulfil their rights (due to others) and their absence of injustice and oppression.</ol> </div>    <P>
And what has preceded is in explanation of the truth and to remove any confusion, and I ask Allaah that he inspires us with that which contains our guidance, that he guides us to the ways of Islaam, and that He strengthens His religion and makes high His word, indeed He is the Most Kind, the Most Generous, and prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and all his companions.     <P>
