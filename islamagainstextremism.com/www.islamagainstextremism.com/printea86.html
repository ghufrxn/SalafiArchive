<p><b>Update to article:</b> Original reports suggested a total of 92 were killed in these terrorist attacks. Afterwards the figure was revised to around 77.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Whilst speaking out against the extremist doctrines of 20th century Kharijite Extremists who were spawned from the books and writings of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> in the 1960s and left a trail of destruction in the Middle East (Egypt, <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a>, Algeria) before they even put a footstep into the Western lands, it is important to realise that <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> is not a monopoly or an exclusive right for the people of one group, race or religion. <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Extremism</font></a> is <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> no matter who it comes from. <img src=assets/images/iae-norway--boikott-israel.gif align=right hspace=6 vspace=8 border=1 border=0>Here we have in <a href='tags/anders-breivik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anders Breivik</font></a> the perfect example. It is established that Breivik was a writer for numerous rabid anti-Muslim pro-Zionist blogs. It is apparent that Breivik is a fervent supporter of rabid anti-Muslim fanatics such as Spencer, Pipes, Geller, Wilders, Schlussel and Gabriel (all surnames) indicating the source of his influence. The youth gathering on the island where the massacre took place consisted of large numbers of future political leaders of Norway, from the <b>Labour Party Youth Movement (AUF)</b>. They harbour a very anti-Israeli stance and have in the past called for criminal proceedings against Israeli leaders (like Sharon). Norway has also been in favour of and supportive of boycotting Israeli goods, Norway's national oil company has boycotted Israel because of settlements in Gaza (it was Norway's Oil and Energy Department building that was bombed and the the building housing the prime minister's office, which are next to each other). Just as a proposal was made in Norway, earlier this year, which allowed for military action against Israel. The picture (at the very youth camp where 600 gathered), is from one day before the massacre. These youth were likely to be in prominent positions in the politics of Norway in the future (most were around 20 years old), and this probably meant an unfavourable political stance towards Israel from a European nation, and once free-thinking people (at the ground and street-level) are able to push their views and moral, ethical positions strongly into the political arena with national policy in their sights, that "disease" might just catch on to other nations. <img src=assets/images/iae-murdoch-sun-oslo.gif align=right hspace=6 vspace=6 border=1 border=0>An attempt was made by privately-owned corporate media outlets to frame the attackers as <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, but as the perpetrator(s) were caught [many witnesses report more than one gunman and a second man was arrested], this quickly lost all of its steam (except in Rupert Murdoch's quarters where cows are employed to maintain a constant, fresh supply - see pic to the right). Why would Breivik leave attacking those huge congregations of Muslim immigrants that are supposedly overtaking Norway and "degrading the country" and instead kill 80 odd politically-charged (mostly) white (Norwegian) kids at a youth camp. Who knows, this could have been a failed attempt by the perpetrator(s) to commit an atrocity (as a lesson to a free-thinking nation) and subsequently blame it on <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> (to tell Norwegians <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are their enemies). Only the facts will tell but so far it is clear that Breivik is a fanatical Christian Zionist influenced by many of the fanatical rabid  anti-Muslim bigots such as those named earlier who foster hatred of Islam and <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. Notice how the word "<b>terrorist</b>" is nowhere to be seen in media reporting...</blockquote> </div>    <P>

A far-right Norwegian nationalist with ardent anti-Muslim views levelled savage blows at the mainstream political culture of his countrywith massive attacks on the government building housing the prime minister's office and a summer camp at which young followers of the ruling Labor Party played.  He killed 80 people.  There are many questions raised by the savagery of this attack.  How could Norwegian security allow such a thing to happen in the heart of Oslo, in a government facility housing the nation's leader and political heart?  How do we apprehend the enormity of the devastation and the fact that it was wrought by a far-right terrorist targeting the country's liberal political leadership?  But for me, another important question which no one, so far is asking is why did most of the world first think the terrorist/s responsible were Muslim, when the actual killer hates <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>? In fact, this is what the New York Times wrote in its story which did report the political affiliation of the killer:    <P>
<blockquote>    Initial reports focused on the possibility of Islamic militants, in particular Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami, or Helpers of the Global <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a>, cited by some analysts as claiming responsibility for the attacks. American officials said the group was previously unknown and might not even exist.    <P>
There was ample reason for concern that terrorists might be responsible.  </blockquote>    <P>
How's that again?  Are the only terrorists in the world Muslim?    If so, what do we call a right-wing nationalist capable of planting major bombs and mowing down scores of people for the sake of the greater glory of his cause?  If even a liberal newspaper like the Times can't call this guy a terrorist, what does that say about the mindset of the western world?    <P>
It's absolutely imperative for the world to face the fact that for every Islamist willing to resort to violence there is a right-wing nationalist willing to do the same.  We can see that in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Equally important to note that while there may be some on the left who have resorted to violence (in thisongress.    <P>
<b>UPDATE:</b> Pam Geller is denying the statement below that Fjordman and Breivik are the same.  And readers have noted that Breivik refers in his own name online favorably to Fjordman in the third person.  Which either means that they are two separate individuals, or else Breivik is playing a double game.  But even if Geller is right, country in the 1960s for example), the overwhelming share of mayhem comes from the political right.  We can see that in Israel, where the extreme settler movement assassinated a prime minister and murdered fellow Israeli Jews.  The same holds true here in the U.S., where a white supremacist, Jared Loughner, recently murdered a federal judge and several others in addition to nearly assassinating Gabrielle Giffords, a Jewish member of C Breivik clearly admires the work of Fjordman, Geller, Spencer and the other anti-jihadi bloggers and says so in his own name.  If there are any Norwegian speakers who can help research Breivik's writings and translate selected ones, please contact me.    <P>
Norwegian bloggers are reporting that Breivik is the author of a blog called Fjordman and that he's guest blogged for Atlas Shrugs, <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> Watch and Gates of Vienna "for years."  As Breivik, he publicly praised one of her posts.  Elise Hendrick has translated a passage from Realisten which confirms that Fjordman and Breivik are one and the same:    <P>
<blockquote>According to his own statements, Anders Behring Breivik previously operated the blog 'Fjordman', and later wrote for many years under the pseudonym Fjordman for the anti-Muslim and Zionist blogs Gates of Vienna and <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> Watch.</blockquote>    <P>
In fact, an intrepid friend of Elise's has created a web page with the "collected works" of the miraculous Fjordman.  Pretty soon there'll be a Festschrift in his honor.  And did you know he's written a book (of course he has, he's an articulate mass-murderer), Defeating Eurabia.  It'll only set you back 50 bucks to get a glimpse into the mind of an anti-jihadi terrorist.  Here's a favorable review of Geert Wilders magnum opus, Fitna penned by Fjordman.  And don't ya know that feminism leads to the oppression of women, natch.  And Caucasophobia is racism, of course.    <P>
I was curious about the views of such an individual would be regarding Israel.  And lo and behold, the educated terrorist doesn't disappoint.  Here is his Why Europeans Should Support Israel.  With friends like this does Israel need enemies?    <P>
There may be people out there more knowledgeable about the minds of assassins, but I've rarely heard of articulate mass murderers.  The most recent one that comes to mind is the Unabomber who wrote long treatises which were published unwillingly by several major newspapers.  Perhaps readers can think of others.  But generally, it appears that our man Breivik is a paragon of the pathological literary mindset.  </blockquote> <P>
