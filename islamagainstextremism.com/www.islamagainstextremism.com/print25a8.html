<p>As we have covered extensively on this site -- extremists and terrorists, as characterised through <a href=index6140.html?nercnev>the Prophetic traditions</a> and throughout the history of Islam fit a certain profile -- they are young, foolish, ignorant and tend to come from troubled or criminal backgrounds. They are easily recruited by the extremist leaders who are in reality motivated by worldly grievances related to wealth and authority but cloak this with the cover of religion to recruit foot-soldiers for their cause.    <P>
In this case, there is speculation whether it was <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> related and it is very easy to sensationalise and claim that it was, but the evidence is not actually clear at this point in time. In any case, we have another example of an ignorant, criminal and violent thug committing these terrible crimes.     <P>
Here are some reports about the perpetrator:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Liege, Belgium (CNN)A man who killed two policewomen and a bystander in the eastern Belgian city of Liege on Tuesday is suspected of killing someone the day before, according to the country's federal prosecutor's office.    <P>
The perpetrator -- named as 31-year-old Belgian national Benjamin H. -- was serving a jail term for theft, violence, drug abuse and insubordination to police, the spokesperson for the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, Eric Van Der Sypt, said Wednesday. <a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/30/europe/belgium-attack-latest-intl/index.html>Source</a></blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>According to state broadcaster RTBF Herman, who was born in 1982, had a criminal record that included a number of convictions for theft, assault and drugs offences. <a href=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/belgium-shooting-gunman-benjamin-herman-was-a-serial-convict-and-appeared-in-government-terrorism-a3850526.html>Source</a></blockquote>    <P>
