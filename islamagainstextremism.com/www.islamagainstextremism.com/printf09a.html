The survey, the first of its kind in Africa, profiled nearly 500 voluntary recruits to militant groups including <a href='tags/al-shabab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shabab</font></a> and <a href='tags/boko-haram.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Boko Haram</font></a>.</div>    <P>

The survey, the first of its kind in Africa, profiled nearly 500 voluntary recruits to militant groups including <a href='tags/al-shabab.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Shabab</font></a> and <a href='tags/boko-haram.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Boko Haram</font></a>.    <P>
Finding a job is "the most acute need at the time of joining a group," the report finds.  It also points to government action as a "tipping point".    <P>
Most of those surveyed reported unhappy childhoods and a lack of parental supervision.    <P>
Researchers from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) spoke to recruits in Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Cameroon and Niger to compile the report.    <P>
Al-Shabab is based in Somalia but often stages attacks in Kenya, while Nigeria's <a href='tags/boko-haram.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Boko Haram</font></a> group has also spread to neighbouring Niger and Cameroon.    <P>
The researchers also interviewed people of similar backgrounds to those recruited, but who did not become radicalised.    <P>
Based on these sample groups, they say that receiving "at least six years of religious schooling [is] shown to reduce the likelihood of joining an extremist group by as much as 32%".    <P>
Recruitment is "predominantly face-to-face" rather than online as outside Africa, and the report says that many recruits come from borderland areas that have "suffered generations of marginalisation".    <P>
The killing or arrest of a family member or friend is a key trigger, according to the report, with over 70% of interviewees saying this or another form of government action was the "tipping point" before the final decision to join a militant group.    <P>
Intervention at a local level is the best way to prevent young people from being radicalised, the UNDP report authors say.    <P>
They suggest "community-led initiatives aimed at social cohesion" and "amplifying the voices of local religious leaders who advocate tolerance".    <P>
"The messenger... is as important as the message," says UNDP Africa Director Abdoulaye Mar Dieye.    <P>
"That trusted local voice is also essential to reducing the sense of marginalisation that can increase vulnerability to recruitment," he adds.</blockquote> <P>
