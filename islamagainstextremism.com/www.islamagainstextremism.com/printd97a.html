<p><div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The September 9/11 attacks on the World Trade towers were of no real strategic benefit to the evil <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a> claimed to have been behind them such as <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> and his followers - (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?eoizx>see here first</a>, <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?owscq>then here second</a> and <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?srjss>then here third</a>, in that order, for undeniable proof that their likes have been spoken of very severely in the Prophetic texts and in some instances declared "<b>dogs of hellfire</b>" despite their appearance of piety). Nor were these attacks of any strategic benefit to the generality of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and their lands. Much has come to light over the past ten years leading to the majority of well-informed people in all nations across the world questioning and no longer having faith in the official story, despite incessant attempts by the corporate media machine to protect it by airing regular hit-pieces. Here we reproduce some of the statements issued by Muslim Scholars following the events, or in relation to the events, outlining the Islamic position on such terrorist activities.</blockquote></div> <P>




<p>This is a transcript of a recorded Tele-link done by Shaykh Salih al-Suhaymee of al-Madinah al-Nabawiyyah, Saudi Arabia, some time after the September 11 event. After praising and thanking Allaah and sending prayers and peace upon the Messenger, Shaykh Salih as-Suhaymee said:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The correct and upright Islaam is a religion which has finalised all other religions (i.e. is the seal of all other religions) and it is a complete religion for all affairs of life. Allaah has decreed happiness and success for the one who abides by and applies it, in this life and next.    <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Thus We have made you [true Muslims] a <i>wasat</i> (just and balanced) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you. (Baqarah 2:143) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Hence, Islaam is a balanced and moderate way, and it does not enter into negligence on the one hand and nor exaggeration or <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> on the other. It is balanced in between and the Muslim nation is also balanced and upon a middle course. Thus, Islaam is balanced in everything, in its creed, in its worship, and it is far removed from both shortcoming and exaggeration. Likewise, in its economy it is also balanced in between those who wish to confiscate money by every right and between those who wish excessive liberalism and encourage it to be given in abundance (above and beyond what is appropriate). In addition, Islaam encourages equity and justice amidst both Muslims and non-Muslims.     <P>
<blockquote class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'><b> Verily, Allah enjoins justice (adl) and good conduct (ihsaan), and giving (help) to kith and kin: and forbids all shameful deeds (fahshaa) and all that is evil (munkar) and oppression (baghy), He admonishes you, that you may take heed. (Nahl 16:90) </b><img src='images/qnend.gif'></blockquote>    <P>
Further, Allaah has also prohibited oppression for himself, and has likewise prohibited His servants from oppression, [saying, as quoted by the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) in the Hadeeth Qudsi], "<b>O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another</b>." (Reported in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Dharr al-Ghifari).    <P>
He has also forbidden transgression and aggression and enmity and harm against others, whatever form this may take. He has also ordered the fulfilment of agreements and obligations and has also forbade the killing of those non-Muslims which Muslim countries have agreements with. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, "<b>Allaah has forbidden the smell of Paradise for the one who kills a Mu'aahad (one with whom there is a pact or agreement)</b>". And He also forbade the Mujahideen from killing women, children, the elderly, and the ascetics who are devoted to worship, as well as forbidding the cutting down of trees and so on - despite the fact that the associates of these categories of people may be involved in fighting with the Muslims.    <P>
Based upon what has preceded, then we say that that which we believe and hold as our religion concerning what happened to the World Trade Centre in America - and in Allaah lies success - that the terrorist attacks that took place and what occurred of general (mass) killing, then it is not permissible and Islam does not allow it in any form whatsoever. Islaam frees itself from this action, regardless of whether those responsible for it were Muslims or non-Muslims. And none of the scholars who are upon the correct form of Islaam, affirm the likes of these actions. The likes of these actions, in any place or time, which happen here and there, were never known in Islaam, ever. In fact, never since Allaah sent the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) till this time of ours. These actions were never known amongst Islaam and the Muslims - assassination of innocent people and bombings and widespread murder.    <P>
So Islaam does not allow them and nor do Muslims perform them, and the true followers of Islaam - which is balanced and moderate - then they free themselves from these actions and from those who performed them, regardless of whether they were Muslims or non-Muslims. This is oppression and Islaam forbids it.    <P>
In this centre there were none but innocent non-Muslims and Muslims, from all the various parts of the world, of different races. They had material possessions and assets in these buildings, and so all of this is impermissible and this is oppression upon both Muslims and non-Muslims. Even if people (who were responsible) claim that they had valid reasons for perpetrating this, then this is not the correct way.    <P>
It is obligatory upon the Muslims in this country and elsewhere and upon the students of knowledge to explain that this action is free from Islaam, and that Islaam is free from these actions. I request them to make clear this issue, with certainty and to be truthful when they explain this issue, without compromising the religion of Islaam, and without giving a bad impression of Islaam.    <P>
And we say, to whomever has justice and fairness amongst the non-Muslims, that they should reflect upon this matter, and not take it out on innocent Muslims and Arabs, for there are millions of them in the United States. They should also not take anything from the media without question. It is desirable for the American people to understand that Islam does not support these affairs, and that they should not use the media in order to ascribe these actions to Islaam. And the Muslims in those areas should participate in explaining that these affairs are not from Islaam.    <P>
In ending, I hope from the students of knowledge specifically and the Muslims generally that they return to the scholars in the likes of these affairs, and that they should return to the Muftee of our country, and to what they have explained of the freedom of Islaam from the likes of these affairs. It is obligatory upon the world to listen to the word of the Muslims, and to the correct Islaam, just like it is upon the students of knowledge in the West that they strive to explain the correct Islaam, balanced between neglect and exaggeration - the Islaam that calls to justice and which calls for the removal of oppression.    <P>
May Allaah guide us to what He loves and is pleased with. Prayers and peace upon the Prophet, his family and companions.</blockquote>   <P>
