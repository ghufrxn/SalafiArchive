<p><div class='sidebar'>Muslims are and have always been the primary targets of the extremist ideology of the Kharijite terrorists whose manifestation in this era is in the form of <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a> and <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis-ll.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a>, and before them in the form of the Egyptian Takfiri-Jihadist groups of the 1970s that were spawned by Sayyid Qutb's doctrines. The terrorist attacks in the West are only minor spillover activities and are not primarily intended in the doctrine of the Kharijite terrorists. The overwhelming majority of the attacks of the terrorists--which never received sustained media coverage, if any--take place in Muslim lands and have much more casualties than spillover <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> in the West (<a href=indexa64a.html?sonsrub>see this article</a>).  </div>    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>This week's terrorist attack targeting people leaving a London mosque after Ramadan prayers is part of a wider phenomenon, in which <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are the most affected by <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> around the world, researchers told ABC News.    <P>
While attacks by <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> against non-Muslims in Europe have dominated headlines recently, researchers from the National Consortium for the Study of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> and Responses to <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> (START), a research and education center at the University of Maryland, believe that <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are in fact the most likely victims of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> worldwide.c    <P>
START Executive Director William Braniff and his team studied the causes and human consequences of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>, compiling details about attacks like the one that took place in London on Monday. What they found is that ? although they did not always have information about the religious beliefs of the victims ? <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> were the most affected overall.    <P>
"In the Middle East, <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are the most likely victims of both <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> and counterterrorism efforts," Braniff told ABC News.    <P>
His point of view may come as a surprise to Westerners who think about <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> only as high-profile attacks carried out in the U.S. and Europe, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year. But when he and his team looked at <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> more comprehensively, including regions like the Middle East and Africa, it became clear that <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are most frequently targeted, he said.    <P>
On May 30, for example, <a href='tags/isis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis-ll.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a> killed 31 people in <a href='tags/iraq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq-mo.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a> in dual <a href='tags/bombings.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bombings</font></a>. One attack used a car bomb, and the other targeted a popular ice cream shop in central Baghdad, according to The Associated Press. But those <a href='tags/bombings.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>bombings</font></a> drew significantly less attention from Western media than the <a href='tags/suicide.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>suicide</font></a> bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that took place May 22. In the Manchester attack, Salman Ramadan Abedi killed more than 20 people and left dozens of others injured, according to authorities.    <P>
But Braniff stressed that <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> face threats from <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> outside the Middle East as well. He said that START researchers found an increase over the past several years in terrorism-related violence against <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in the 35 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organization that includes the U.S. and much of Europe.    <P>
"Here, we've seen an increase in attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists but also terrorist attacks targeted against <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>," he said...  </blockquote>    <P>
