<img src=assets/images/stan-grant-muslims-speak-terrorism.png width="100%" border=0>  Original report on <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-09/muslims-speak-out-against-terrorism/8606296>ABC Australia</a> Friday, 9 June 2017    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>I have had many such conversations over two decades of reporting around the world; ordinary <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> locked in a battle for the soul of their faith.    <P>
Too often these conversations took place after a terrorist attack had killed <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. They are at the frontline of this battle. It comes out of their mosques and explodes in their streets.    <P>
According to the US National Counterterrorism Centre, up to 97 per cent of fatalities in the past five years have been <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>.    <P>
Muslims are seven times more likely than non-Muslims to be the victims of terror.    <P>
It is so commonplace that it often barely makes the headlines of our media. It is a reality that we do not feel the pain of those lost lives as deeply as we do the lives lost in the West.    <P>
It is worth remembering that as we sift through the column inches of commentary and listen to our politicians accusing <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of not speaking out loudly enough against Islamic inspired <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>.    <P>
These critics are either wilfully ignorant, deliberately misleading or malicious. They are certainly selective in their facts.    <P>
<b>Public condemnation</b>    <P>
The vast majority of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> reject <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 until 2007, Pew Research conducted extensive worldwide studies of attitudes towards <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>.    <P>
The research polled thousands of people representing up to 90 per cent of the world's Islamic populations and found that 93 per cent condemned the 9/11 attacks as unjustified.    <P>
In 2015, Pew released another study showing overwhelming negative views of <a href='tags/islamic-state.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islamic State</font></a> among <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>.    <P>
Why wouldn't they? They are the people targeted by these extremist groups. It is their children that IS seeks to pervert and recruit.    <P>
The civilian <a href='tags/death.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>death</font></a> toll alone in <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a> since the rise of IS, according to the group <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a> Body Count, is more than 170,000.    <P>
Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, more than a quarter of a million people have been killed.    <P>
Georgetown University Professor and <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> expert, Tamara Sonn, asks hard questions about the role of Islam in <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> in her recent book, Is Islam an Enemy of the West?    <P>
Professor Sonn makes it clear that <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> is a crime against Islamic law. She says there is a word for it - hirabah - which describes actions of terror and violence against random victims. She says it is the very opposite of the word for peace.    <P>
Professor Sonn writes that Muslim authorities of every variety - diverse Sunnis and Shia - have repeatedly and publicly condemned <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> as crimes both against Islam and humanity at large.    <P>
She cites the September 12, 2001 press release by the organisation representing the 57 Muslim majority countries, the Organisation of the Islamic Co-operation, that condemned the 9/11 attacks as "criminal and brutal acts ... counter to all covenants, humanitarian values and divine religions, foremost among which is Islam".    <P>
After the 2004 attacks in Madrid that killed nearly 200 people, the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia issued a public statement describing the assault as "pernicious and shameless evils which are not justified by any sane logic, nor by the religion of Islam".    <P>
In 2004, King Abdullah of Jordan issued a comprehensive condemnation of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> signed by 200 Muslim authorities from 50 countries.    <P>
In part it read: "Assault upon the life of a human being, be it murder, injury or threat, is an assault upon the right to life among all human beings."    <P>
In 2014 ,dozens of Sunni Muslim religious authorities issued an open letter to <a href='tags/islamic-state.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islamic State</font></a> leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. Line by line they refuted the IS doctrine.    <P>
The leaders said he had no legitimacy.    <P>
None of this is hard to find. All the research is available online. All the public statements are on the official record.    <P>
Professor Sonn's book can be found easily in our stores.    <P>
<b>At best a distortion, at worst an outright lie</b>    <P>
No-one need be ignorant, yet again this week we are seeing politicians and pundits doubling down on the Muslim community - the people who pay more than anyone with their own blood in the fight against <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> - saying they don't do enough to condemn Islamic <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a>...    <P>
Accusing <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> of not strongly condemning <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> is at best a distortion, at worst an outright lie.    <P>
The other claim is that Islam is at the core of the wave of violent <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a>, as though somehow the religion is to blame.    <P>
These arguments are often built around selective quotes from the Koran with little nuance.    <P>
The Koran was delivered over a 20-year period covering times of war and peace.    <P>
Its verses address justice and conflict. Koranic scholars are careful to locate the teachings within their correct context.    <P>
Extremist groups like IS hijack the teachings to deliver a twisted version of the religion.    <P>
As Professor Sonn points out, this is precisely why learned Islamic leaders have denounced the group as illegitimate.    <P>
What we are seeing is an extremist group using religion to pursue a political purpose.    <P>
Political scientist Richard English places the rise of Islamic violent <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> within a global history of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> in his book, Does <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> Work?    <P>
Terrorism he says, is rooted in the idea that at certain times it is considered the most effective way of achieving necessary goals.    <P>
It is, he says, a "violent form of politics".    <P>
This violent form has operated under many guises.    <P>
Between 1868-1871 alone, white-hooded bible-wielding terrorists killed 20,000 African Americans. They were called the Ku Klux Klan.    <P>
Between 1931 and 1948 the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary organisation, operated in Mandate Palestine. Its campaign of insurgent violence expedited British withdrawal from the region.    <P>
Spear of the Nation, an armed wing of the African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela pursued majority black rights in South Africa.    <P>
A group of Welsh separatists, the Free Wales Army, used violence in a failed attempt to achieve independent statehood.    <P>
From Sri Lanka to Ireland to Greece, militant groups have used ideology and violent tactics to achieve their aims.    <P>
As England points out, ultimately most fail and progress, when it does come, follows an end of hostilities.</blockquote>    <P>
