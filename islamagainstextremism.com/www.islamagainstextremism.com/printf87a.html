<p><blockquote>Numerous reports can be found on the topic of <a href='tags/entrapment.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Entrapment</font></a> and sting operations. Refer to "<b>The Informants</b>" by Trevor Aaronson in the September 2011 issue of Mother Jones magazine (available online). There is also Stephen Down and Kathy Manley's detailed 178-page academic study titled, "<b>Inventing Terrorists: The Lawfare of Preemptive Prosecution</b>" and a search for "<i>Muslim entrapment</i>" will return many examples of media coverage on this subject.     <P>
It is important to distinguish between a number of things. There is <b>a)</b> the extremist, terrorist ideology, <b>b)</b> extremists and terrorists and <b>c)</b> <a href='tags/terrorist-plots.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Terrorist Plots</font></a>. As for the first, the extremist, terrorist ideology, or what has been known to the scholars of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> for 1400 years as the Kharijite ideology - a renegade sect prophesized by the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to appear recurringly, putting the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> to trial. They excommunicate Muslim <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>, governments and societies and unleash murder and terror upon them. This is the ideology of <a href='tags/al-qaidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaidah</font></a>, <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a> and groups like them. <b>This ideology is NOT created by any foreign policy</b>. It is a crooked, twisted, anti-Islamic, evil ideology. As for extremists, terrorists, then the right circumstances and factors can lead to radicalization and <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> of individuals but only in the presence of ignorance about Islam or a distortion of Islamic teachings. In other words, the unislamic extremist ideology itself still remains the crucial factor in the synthesis of a terrorist mindset. As for <a href='tags/terrorist-plots.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Terrorist Plots</font></a>, whether failed or executed, then not all <a href='tags/terrorist-plots.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Terrorist Plots</font></a> - particularly in the Western countries - are genuine. In fact, genuine acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> are far more abundant in the lands of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> than anywhere else and the ideology of <a href='tags/al-qaidah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaidah</font></a>, <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a>, Boko Haram and groups like them kill more <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> than non-Muslims, since the ideology, <i>in its foundation</i>, is directed at <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and not non-Muslims. Terrorist acts against non-Muslims are only the branch, not the foundation.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>  A report titled "<b>The New Jihadism</b>" which was published by the Department of War Studies at King's College London indicates that during the month of November 2014, chosen as a sample month for the study, a total of 664 attacks led to the deaths of 5042 people, the overwhelming majority of which were in Ir&#257;q (1770), Nigeria (786), Afgh&#257;nistan (782), <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> (693), Yemen (410), Somalia (216) and Pakistan (212).  Peter Neumann, the author of the report states, "This report, therefore, tells the story of a movement in the middle of a transformation - one whose final outcome is impossible to predict. The immediate focus, however, is jihadism's human cost: with, on average, more than 20 attacks and nearly 170 deaths per day, jihadist groups destroy countless lives - most of them Muslim - in the name of an ideology that the vast majority of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> reject." And he notes in the conclusion, "In just one month, jihadist groups killed 5,042 people - the equivalent of three attacks on the scale of the London bombings in July 2005 each day. Contrary to the often articulated complaint that jihadism is over-reported and that groups like the Islamic State get too much coverage, our survey seems to suggest that most of the victims receive practically no attention. Hardly any of the attacks that formed the basis for our analysis were reported in the Western media. Indeed, even the <a href='tags/suicide-bombings.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>suicide bombings</font></a> - of which there were 38 - made virtually no headlines except in the countries in which they took place. Yet most of the victims of jihadist violence continue to be non-combatants, and the vast majority is Muslim."   </blockquote></div>    <P>
An <a href=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/16/howthefbicreatedaterrorist/>excellent article</a> by Aaron Stevenson shows how mentally unstable, disillusioned <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> or even new <a href='tags/converts.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Converts</font></a> are targeted and  preyed upon by undercover agents, brainwashed, directed and then supported, financially and with materials, to organize acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>. Leaked transcripts and video footage are provided showing how agents joke about the victim and his manipulation. The following video sheds some light on the matter.    <P>
<div align=center><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/122198605" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>    <P>
Here is an excerpt from Aaronson's article:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>IN THE VIDEO, Sami Osmakac is tall and gaunt, with jutting cheekbones and a scraggly beard. He sits cross-legged on the maroon carpet of the hotel room, wearing white cotton socks and pants that rise up his legs to reveal his thin, pale ankles. An AK-47 leans against the closet door behind him. What appears to be a <a href='tags/suicide.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>suicide</font></a> vest is strapped to his body. In his right hand is a pistol.     <P>
"Recording," says an unseen man behind the camera.    <P>
"This video is to all the Muslim youth and to all the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> worldwide," Osmakac says, looking straight into the lens. "This is a call to the truth. It is the call to help and aid in the party of Allah - and pay him back for every sister that has been raped and every brother that has been tortured and raped."    <P>
<img src=assets/images/osmakac-martyrdom.jpg align="right" width="100" style="margin:6px 0px 8px 12px;" border=0>    <P>
Osmakac in his "martyrdom video." (YouTube)    <P>
The recording goes on for about eight minutes. Osmakac says he'll avenge the deaths of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in Afghanistan, <a href='tags/iraq.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq-mo.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a>, Pakistan and elsewhere. He refers to Americans as kuffar, an Arabic term for nonbelievers. "Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth," he says. "Woman for a woman, child for a child."    <P>
Osmakac was 25 years old on January 7, 2012, when he filmed what the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice would later call a "martyrdom video." He was also broke and struggling with mental illness.    <P>
After recording this video in a rundown Days Inn in Tampa, Florida, Osmakac prepared to deliver what he thought was a car bomb to a popular Irish bar. According to the government, Osmakac was a dangerous, lone-wolf terrorist who would have bombed the Tampa bar, then headed to a local casino where he would have taken hostages, before finally detonating his <a href='tags/suicide.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>suicide</font></a> vest once police arrived.    <P>
But if Osmakac was a terrorist, he was only one in his troubled mind and in the minds of ambitious federal agents. The government could not provide any evidence that he had connections to international terrorists. He didn't have his own weapons. He didn't even have enough money to replace the dead battery in his beat-up, green 1994 Honda Accord.    <P>
Osmakac was the target of an elaborately orchestrated FBI sting that involved a paid informant, as well as FBI agents and support staff working on the setup for more than three months. The FBI provided all of the weapons seen in Osmakac's martyrdom video. The bureau also gave Osmakac the car bomb he allegedly planned to detonate, and even money for a taxi so he could get to where the FBI needed him to go. Osmakac was a deeply disturbed young man, according to several of the psychiatrists and psychologists who examined him before trial. He became a 'terrorist' only after the FBI provided the means, opportunity and final prodding necessary to make him one.    <P>
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the FBI has arrested dozens of young men like Osmakac in controversial counterterrorism stings. One recent case involved a rudderless 20-year-old in Cincinnati, Ohio, named Christopher Cornell, who conspired with an FBI informant - seeking "favorable treatment" for his own "criminal exposure" - in a harebrained plot to build pipe bombs and attack Capitol Hill. And just last month, on February 25, the FBI arrested and charged two Brooklyn men for plotting, with the aid of a paid informant, to travel to <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> and join the Islamic State. The likelihood that the men would have stepped foot in <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> of their own accord seems low; only after they met the informant, who helped with travel applications and other hurdles, did their planning take shape.    <P>
Informant-led sting operations are central to the FBI's counterterrorism program. Of 508 defendants prosecuted in federal terrorism-related cases in the decade after 9/11, 243 were involved with an FBI informant, while 158 were the targets of sting operations. Of those cases, an informant or FBI undercover operative led 49 defendants in their <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> plots, similar to the way Osmakac was led in his.    <P>
In these cases, the FBI says paid informants and undercover agents are foiling attacks before they occur. But the evidence suggests - and a recent Human Rights Watch report on the subject illustrates - that the FBI isn't always nabbing would-be terrorists so much as setting up mentally ill or economically desperate people to commit crimes they could never have accomplished on their own.    <P>
At least in Osmakac's case, FBI agents seem to agree with that criticism, though they never intended for that admission to become public. In the Osmakac sting, the undercover FBI agent went by the pseudonym "Amir Jones." He's the guy behind the camera in Osmakac's martyrdom video. Amir, posing as a dealer who could provide weapons, wore a hidden recording device throughout the sting.    <P>
The device picked up conversations, including, apparently, back at the FBI's Tampa Field Office, a gated compound beneath the flight path of Tampa International Airport, among agents and employees who assumed their words were private and protected. These unintentional recordings offer an exclusive look inside an FBI counterterrorism sting, and suggest that, even in the eyes of the FBI agents involved, these sting targets aren't always the threatening figures they are made out to be.  </blockquote>    <P>
One can also refer to Judge Napolitano's five minute rant on Fox News (of all places) about fake terror plots.     <P>
<div align=center><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G21-ZScALiA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>    <P>
The very sporadic (rare) genuine acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> that may take take place in the West alongside the abundant fake, manufactured <a href='tags/terrorist-plots.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Terrorist Plots</font></a> are given huge media attention, whilst the daily terrorist atrocities performed by the <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-bk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> against <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in their lands receive very little, if no media attention at all.   </blockquote> <P>
