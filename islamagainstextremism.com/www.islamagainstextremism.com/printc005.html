<p>The esteemed and late Shaikh Muhammad bin Salih al-'Uthaimin of Saudi Arabia stated, during a tele-link in the evening of Friday, 28th July 2000, to an audience in the city of Birmingham, UK, during a conference organized by Maktabah Salafiyyah:    <P>
    <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>... Likewise I invite you to have respect for those people who have the right that they should be respected, those between whom there is an agreement (of protection) for you. For the land in which you are living is such that there is an agreement between you and them. If this were not the case they would have killed you or expelled you. So preserve this agreement, and do not prove treacherous to it, since treachery is a sign of the hypocrites, and it is not from the way of the Believers. And know that it is authentically reported from the Prophet that he said,     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Whoever kills one who is under and agreement of protection will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.</i></blockquote>    <P>
    Do not be fooled by those sayings of the foolish people, those who say "Those people are Non-Muslims, so their wealth is lawful for us (to misappropriate or take by way of murder and killing)." <b>For by Allaah - this is a lie. A lie about Allaah's Religion, and a lie about Islamic societies</b>.    <P>
    So we may not say that it is lawful to be treacherous towards people whom we have an agreement with.    <P>
    O my brothers. O youth. O Muslims. <u>Be truthful in your buying and selling, and renting, and leasing, and in all mutual transactions</u>. Because truthfulness is from the characteristics of the Believers, and Allaah - the Most High - has commanded truthfulness - in the saying of Allaah - the Most High -    <P>
    <div class='quotequran'><img src='images/qnstart.gif'> <b>O you who believe - fear and keep you duty to Allaah and be with the truthful</b> <img src='images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
    And the Prophet encouraged truthfulness and said, <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Adhere to truthfulness, because truthfulness leads to goodness, and goodness leads to Paradise. And a person will continue to be truthful, and strive to be truthful until he will be written down with Allaah as a truthful person.</i></blockquote>    <P>
    And he warned against falsehood, and said, <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'><i>Beware of falsehood, because falsehood leads to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Fire. And a person will continue lying, and striving to lie until he is written down with Allaah as a great liar.</i></blockquote>    <P>
    O my brother Muslims. O youth. Be true in your sayings with your brothers, and with those Non-Muslims whom you live along with - so that you will be inviters to the Religion of Islaam, by your actions and in reality. So how many people there are who first entered into Islaam because of the behaviour and manners of the Muslims, and their truthfulness, and their being true in their dealings.</blockquote> <P>
