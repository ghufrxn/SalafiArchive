<p>This is a 70 page report on the role of organizations and think-tanks such as <b><a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a></b> and <b><a href='tags/centre-for-social-cohesion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Centre for Social Cohesion</font></a></b> in stirring sentiments and hatred against Muslims in Britain. The report reveals the sources of funding and the individuals involved with these organizations and highlights the adverse effects upon Muslims in particular.     <P>
The report is a very interesting read and exposes a lot of the underhand and secret tactics which are employed in order to stirr up hatred against Islam and the Muslims. This type of approach only alienates Muslims further and pushes those who are vulnerable into the hands of the extremists and their false ideologies. Disclaimer: This report is provided here for information purposes as we believe it is of general benefit and in the <a href='tags/public-interest.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>public interest</font></a>, and it does not mean that we necessarily agree with every single opinion contained therein.    <P>

Conservative think-tanks help fuel a culture of fear, allowing far-right groups to prosper. By David Miller et. al. David Miller is Professor of Sociology at the University of Strathclyde.

Some quotes from the report and from editorial pieces announing the report:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In justification of his attacks in Norway, killing more than seventy civilians, mostly teenagers, <a href='tags/anders-breivik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anders Breivik</font></a> issued a manifesto: 2083 A European Declaration of Independence. It has been widely reported that he cited a long list of Islamophobic and "counterjihad" writers such as the Americans <a href='tags/robert-spencer.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Robert Spencer</font></a>, <a href='tags/daniel-pipes.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Daniel Pipes</font></a>, Pamela Geller and <a href='tags/frank-gaffney.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Frank Gaffney</font></a> of the Center for Security Policy - and the Egyptian-born, Swiss-based Bat Ye'or who has popularised the concept of "Eurabia" - the supposedly secret conspiracy for the Islamic takeover of Europe. Less prominent, but also cited, was a UK think-tank that is close to the UK government and credited with influencing UK anti-terrorist policy. <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> is one of two conservative think-tanks we examine in our <a href=cold-war-on-british-muslims9a5e.pdf?a=isjeyf> new Spinwatch report</a> [PDF], that attempts to understand the current climate of fear being whipped up against Muslims in Britain - and indeed across Europe and the US.    <P>
The citation of <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> seems innocent enough, as Breivik simply cites public opinion data published by the think-tank. However, as it happens, this precise data is highlighted in our report as an indication of the potential for bias and ideology in the way think-tanks such as <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> operate. Our report also examines another key conservative think-tank that has been prominent in arguing for a counter-subversion approach to Islam, the <a href='tags/centre-for-social-cohesion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Centre for Social Cohesion</font></a>.</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>We wrote to <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> and the CSC requesting, in the interests of transparency, that they disclose its sources of funding. The CSC stated in its response only that it was funded by private donations and has "neither sought nor received public funds". <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> failed to respond. Nevertheless, our report reveals for the first time the network of individuals and foundations that are bankrolling both think-tanks. Donors identified in the report include the neoconservative Rosenkranz Foundation in the United States, and hardline Zionists such as Stanley Kalms and the late Cyril Stein in the UK. It reveals that both think-tanks share major donors with a number of controversial organisations - including the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers, the Israel-Diaspora Trust (an organisation founded by the late Rabbi Sidney Brichto, a passionate supporter of Israel and scourge of its critics inside and outside the UK Jewish community) and the Anglo-Israel Association, founded in 1949 by the Christian Zionist Sir Wyndham Deedes. His nephew William Deedes became an editor of the Daily Telegraph and, in 2006, wrote an opinion piece entitled: "Muslims can never conform to our ways".</blockquote>    <P>
And on the <a href=http://www.spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/317-islamophobia/5446-how-policy-exchange-and-the-centre-for-social-cohesion-encourage-the-cold-war-on-british-muslims>Spinwatch.org</a> page:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>In a report published today, Spinwatch examines the <a href='tags/centre-for-social-cohesion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Centre for Social Cohesion</font></a> and Policy Exchange; two key right-wing think-tanks involved in the debate on Islam and multiculturalism which are thought to have influenced the Coalition Government's new Prevent strategy.    <P>
The report, which was completed before the recent terrorist attacks in Norway, argues that right-wing think-tanks have understated the rise of <a href='tags/islamophobia-ks.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/islamophobia.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Islamophobia</font></a></font></a> on the far-right and in some cases condoned the rise of groups such as the English Defence League because of their own links to the 'counterjihad movement'.    <P>
The Cold War on British Muslims, shows how the <a href='tags/centre-for-social-cohesion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Centre for Social Cohesion</font></a> and <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> have rejected counter-terrorism policies based on public safety and have instead sought to revive discredited counter-subversion policies from the Cold War era - policies which targeted a generation of trade union leaders and peace activists including future Labour Ministers.  The report warns that reviving such policies is likely to stigmatise and even criminalise politically active Muslims, as well as liberals and leftists, and risk undermining the traditional freedoms enjoyed by churches, schools, universities and public libraries.    <P>
The Cold War on British Muslims also reveals for the first time the network of individuals and foundations that are bankrolling both think-tanks.  Donors identified in the report include the neoconservative Rosenkranz Foundation in the United States, and hardline Zionists like Lord Kalms and the late Cyril Stein in the UK.  It reveals that both think-tanks share major donors with a number of controversial organisations including the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers, the Israel-Diaspora Trust (an organisation founded by the late Rabbi Sidney Brichto, a passionate supporter of Israel and scourge of its critics inside and outside the UK Jewish community) and the Anglo-Israel Association (founded in 1949 by the Christian Zionist Sir Wyndham Deedes).    <P>
The report's co-author, Professor David Miller of Strathclyde University, said: 'The policies advocated by the <a href='tags/centre-for-social-cohesion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Centre for Social Cohesion</font></a> and <a href='tags/policy-exchange.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Policy Exchange</font></a> detailed in the report inevitably mean the curtailment of civil liberties and the narrowing of political debate.  The consequences for British Muslims though will be even more serious.'    <P>
He added: 'The revelations about the think-tanks' donors arguably calls into question their ability to produce fair and balanced research and certainly underlines the need for greater transparency over the funding of think-tanks.'</blockquote>    <P>
This report was done before <a href='tags/anders-breivik.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anders Breivik</font></a>, an anti-Muslim Christian-Zionist terrorist, killed around 70-80 Norwegian youths gathered at a youth-camp where anti-Israeli demands were being made. It is not unlikely that he had accomplices because such an act (double terror strike killing around 70-80 people) cannot be pulled off by a single person without a very high level of co-ordinated planning. Had the report been done later, it would have highlighted the roles played by these think-tanks, along with hate-filled anti-Muslim pro-Zionists (Spencer, Pipes, Geller, Wilders etc.) in goading individuals such as Brievik into these types of actions.   <P>
