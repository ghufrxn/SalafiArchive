<p>Bismillah wal-Hamdulillah.    <P>
<blockquote><img src=assets/images/isis-women-ht-0.png align="right" style="padding: 8px 0px 8px 12px;" border=0>Channel 4 played a documentary last night exposing a group of women in London who are supporting <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a> and actively recruiting other women to join them and support them. All of these women are followers of the charlatan, fraudster and pseudo-scholar <b>Omar Bakri Mohammad</b>, a follower of the ideology of <b><a href='tags/hizb-al-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb al-Tahrir</font></a></b> who later set up <b><a href='tags/al-muhajiroun.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Muhajiroun</font></a></b>.     <P>
One can see clearly from the statements of these ignorant misguided women, their private lectures and their postings on online social media that they are upon the methodology of <b><a href='tags/hizb-al-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb al-Tahrir</font></a></b> and followers of the ideology of <b>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahan</b>i <a href=http://nabahani.com/>(website</a>). These misguided brainless women, living in the UK, holding UK passports (oh, hold on, its a "necessity" right) and benefiting from whatever benefits the state provides (in terms of public safety, security, infrastructure, amenities and so on) them are using social media to send out extremist messages. These ignorant women publish statements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> (excommunication) against other <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who live in the West and do not share their extremist ideology, laying charges of disbelief (kufr) and hypocrisy (nifaq) against them. </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> One should note that Salafi <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, since the early 1990s have played an instrumental role in exposing these deviants who are in reality following the writings and blueprint of <b><a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a></b> <a href=http://nabahani.com/>(website</a>), a former <b>Ba'thist Nationalist</b> who was involved in intrigues and <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> in <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> during the late 1940s. He took his experience with Ba'thist Nationalist movements and set up an organization of "liberation" (<a href='tags/hizb-al-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb al-Tahrir</font></a>). The structure and operation was exactly like those in Communist-type parties: Small, rigid cell-networks of a few to a dozen people, tightly-integrated, organized and operating in secrecy, enlargening their circles through recruitment. In those days, these deviants were following everything in al-Nabahani's books, including <b>the Mu'tazili school of doctrine</b> in matters of belief. Due to extensive Salafi refutations against their misguidance in this area, they realised that they have to let go of this baggage in order to win wider support and recover from the damage done to their cause at the hands of the Salafi <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. This Machiavellian approach was signalled when towards the end of the 1990s, the charlatan and fraudster, <b>Omar Bakri Mohammad</b> started contactiing Salafi <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and making claims of being a Salafi. This was a ploy to expand his sphere of influence and to slither into the field like a slimey snake. He failed in his attempts of course. Over the next decade, his followers appeared in many different forms and disguises, choosing different names and labels, "<a href="tags/al-muhajiroun.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Muhajiroun</font></a>", "Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah", "The Saved Sect", "Islam4Uk", "The Strangers" and so on. They did this to disguise who they really were and what they were calling to and this allowed them to penetrate mosques and communities more easily. This is the nature of all destructive political movements, they use secrecy and subterfuge and these are alien to Islam. Islam is open and apparent and whenever people meet together in secret to discuss affairs exclusive to the common folk in matters of religion, they are upon the foundations of misguidance. Nevertheless, the Salafi <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> continued to expose them with written refutations and lectures and sermons, and finally, towards the end of the 2000s, these deviants deceptively took on the label of "Salafi." This calculated trick had two objectives: <u>First</u>, as a means of camouflage, a cover for their misguidance and deviation. <u>Second</u>, to discredit the Salafis through the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> they were upon, so it would be ascribed to the Salafis in general. Keeping the khilafah-centric ideology at the core, they veiled it with speech and language in other areas, aiming to conceal their misguidance. It is these people today who are callers to <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a> and they have nothing to do with <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> or the Salafis. They are imposters whose history is well known to whoever has been involved in Islamic preaching since the early 1990s. There are no greater enemies to them and to their misguidance than the Salafi <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. A long and huge trail of evidence exists for this tracing all the way back to the early to mid 1990s, the period in which battles raged between them (the Salafis) and these deviants on this very issue of the khilafah.   </blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote>From their social media accounts these deranged women - [the identities of some of them are revealed in the program and others remain dubious] - are issuing threats of terrorist attacks against European countries and boasting about past attacks. They are also indoctrinating others to believe that it is obligatory to migrate to the alleged "<a href="tags/islamic-state.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Islamic State</font></a>" and are providing tactics as to how to make their way to <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a>. This includes using <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a>, treachery and theft even if from one's parents. Some of them even encourage theft of parent's money to book airplane tickets to get to Syria! This cannot be for any other reason except that they believe that the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> parents of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who have adopted the khilafah-centric ideology are disbelievers whose wealth is lawful to misappropriate.</blockquote>     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>Note:</b> These are the very same tactics used by the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> who revolted against the main body of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in the time of Ali (radiyallaahu anhu) and isolated themselves in Harooraa near Kufah and eventually went on to set up their counter "<a href="tags/islamic-state.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Islamic State</font></a>" in Nahrawaan which was 12 miles south of Baghdad. Over the  next two years they began to recruit mostly the youth from the various townships using stealth methods, encouraging them to abandon their parents and relatives (because everyone was living in disbelief unless they migrated to their "<a href="tags/islamic-state.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Islamic State</font></a>"). They convinced them that "enjoining good and forbidding evil" was compulsory upon them and that their faith is invalid until they migrate and join them. Thus, history is simply repeating itself and whoever considers all the activities of these people will find an amazing correlation - from so many different aspects - to the very first Kharijite extremists. To learn more please read <a href=index6140.html?nercnev>this extensive 90 page document</a> that provides all the historical details. </blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote>These women are clearly followers of <b>Omar Bakri Mohammad</b>, <b>Anjem Chaudhury</b> and <b>Abu al-Baraa Mizan ur-Rahman</b> and others. Their roots all go back to Hizb ul-Tahrir and their ideology is the ideology of the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/tahriris.png width="560" border=0>    <P>
In order, <a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a>, the <a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/tags/abu-waleed.cfm>Takfiri Retard</a> Abu Waleed Shahid Janjua, Abul-Bara Mizan ur-Rahman, Abu Salih, Abu Izzuddeen Trevor Brooks, Khalid al-Fikri and <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a>.    <P>
<b>HOW SHOULD <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> TACKLE THESE PEOPLE</b>    <P>
The <b>first</b> and most crucial thing is to strip them bare in terms of their ideology, they have succeeded in concealing themselves under labels and they should be called out and the core of their ideology exposed. They are <b><a href='tags/hizb-al-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb al-Tahrir</font></a></b>, they should be labeled clearly and openly with  this title. <a href='tags/hizb-al-tahrir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizb al-Tahrir</font></a> followers, followers of the khilafah-centric idea of <a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a>. This is where the path ultimately leads to. Alongside that, they have ideas of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and those of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> in general. We have to always trace this ideology to its contemporary founder(s) and peel off the layers of <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a> these people have used to conceal themselves. These people shoult NOT be allowed to pass off under the labels of "Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah" or "Salafis." This is the first most important step in cutting through the roots of their <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a>.    <P>
The <b>second thing</b> is to educate the general masses, the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and non-Muslims at large, that these people do not speak for the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> - even if they use issues which <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are affected by - such as the maltreatment of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in Palestine for example or elsewhere and the injustices arising due to wars and unjust foreing policies and so on, these people do not represent the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, they simply assume that role, and they have an agenda, their agenda is political, they are not interested in teaching people their religion, an authentic version of their religion, they only use aspects of the religion (which they twist) to serve <b>a political ideology</b> - that is what it is, a political ideology, and to recruit to this ideology, they manipulate the emotions of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who are genuinely concerned about the maltreatment of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> across the world and injustices against them. They do not have any scholars, they do not even understand the basics of the religion as is clear from their statements and activities. These people are ignorant of Allaah's law in His creation, they are ignorant in the subjects of al-qadaa wal-qadar, they are ignorant of how Allaah's names and attributes, his wisdom and justice correlate to worldly affairs, they are blind in religious affairs and in turn in worldly affairs. What they are proposing, the ideology they are serving and the methodologies they are calling to, these are not methodologies of reform.    <P>
<b>Thirdly</b>, these people,the women included are the vilest of the factions of the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>, they are known as <b>the Qa'diyyah</b>, the Muslim scholars have spoke of them, they are the ones who sit and push the ideology and incite others, whilst they themselves do not participate physically. They incite others through certain words, phrases, language, they are careful not to break the law, but they say things in such a way so as to incite others into a way of thinking, that leads them to what opposes Islam and what causes corruption. The Islamic scholar <a href='tags/ibn-hajar-oz.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/ibn-hajar.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Ibn Hajar</font></a></font></a> al-Asqalani (d. 1449CE) said, "The Qa'diyyah, they are the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> who are not seen participating in battle, but they show open rejection against the oppressive <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> according to their ability, they invite others to their doctrine, and they beautify <a href='tags/rebellion.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rebellion</font></a> and make it appear good." (al-Tahdhib 8/114). The Muslim scholars have said these are the vilest (akhbath) of the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>, and that is what we have here, these people the Tahriris disguising themselves as Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, or Salafis or the Saved Sect and all their other fraudulent labels, they are the vilest, they are Qa'diyyah. They sit in London and from their they incite others with the ideology of the <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>.     <P>
<b>Fourth:</b> It is upon all Muslim parents to monitor whom their children are listening to online and who has access to their hearing and seeing. This includes monitoring their phones and their use of social media. Muslim parents have the <a href='tags/responsibility.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>responsibility</font></a> of teaching their children authentic, sound Islamic <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> and sound principles through which they can identify and  keep away from exaggeration and <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> in the religion. This can only be achieved through an authentic understanding of the Quran and the Sunnah upon the understanding of the Companions and traditional scholars of Islam.     <P>
