				The following is a transcription of a live tele-link lecture given by By Shaykh Alee al-Hadaadee (Riyaadh, Saudi Arabia) to an audience in London organized by al-Athariyyah.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Lecture</font>    <P>
<blockquote>All praise is due to Allaah the Lord of everything He created and the peace and blessings of  Allaah upon the best of Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, whom Allaah sent to mankind  as a mercy, and peace and blessings upon the family of the Prophet and his companions,  and upon those who follow the guidance of the Prophet until the Day of Judgement.    <P>
O my noble brothers, we heard the unfortunate news, which occurred yesterday in the city  of London, relating to those explosions which took place which resulted in many people  dying and many people being wounded. And there is no doubt that this is an unfortunate  and sad affair and it's even worse if these acts have been committed and carried out in the  name of Islaam, because Islaam is free and far removed from these types of acts. It does  not command with these types of activities, and Islaam is not pleased with the likes of  these activities.    <P>
Rather, Islaam prohibits the likes of these things. And Islaam is at war with these types of  treacherous acts. And likewise, Islaam threatens a heavy punishment to those people who  do these acts, in this life and the hereafter. Verily the true Islaam is that which has come in the Qur'aan (The book of Allaah) and in the Sunnah (The guidance of His noble Messenger).  And not everything that is said to be Islaam is in actual fact considered part of the religion of Islaam.    <P>
And this is to be returned to the Qur'aan and to the Sunnah. We find in both of them a  clear warning against every type of transgression. Warning against transgressing against a  Muslim and a non-Muslim.    <P>
Allaah, the Most High, said:    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> <b>And do not kill those souls whom Allaah has prohibited unless  [justified by]  a due [legal] right</b> <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
And those souls that Allaah has prohibited, it is referring to the life of a Muslim. And it is referring to everyone who has an agreement with the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, and likewise those non-  Muslims who have been given right of safety by the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>.    <P>
The Messenger of Allaah said, in an authentic hadeeth reported by imam al-Bukhari,    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>Whoever kills a non-Muslim who has an agreement with the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> then he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise</b></blockquote>    <P>
And this is a severe threat. That the Messenger of Allaah, Muhammad, threatened those  people and he promised them; he promised those who kill non-Muslims, after an agreement  has reached between them, that they will not enter Paradise on the Day of Judgement. And  by this hadeeth we surely understand and get to know, we obtain with certainty, that these  bombings, if committed by a Muslim, they have oppose the book of Allaah. And they  have opposed the Sunnah of the Messenger.    <P>
O my brothers, these types of activities will result in many evils and harmful effects.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>The first of them</u></font>    <P>
That <b>transgressing against a person without any due right</b> and <b>taking a  life without any right</b> is a <b>great crime</b>.    <P>
The Prophet said,    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>A Muslim person will not cease to be clearly and correctly upon his religion as long as they do not spill blood which is impermissible for them</b></blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>The second affair</u></font>    <P>
That <b>these types of activities enforce the breaking of a contract</b>. For  example the Muslim who has entered into Britain. He has made an agreement and a  promise that he will preserve the security and the safety in that land and that he will not  transgress against anyone without due cause. So these filthy activities of <a href='../tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> involve  breaking a contract and an agreement one has made.    <P>
And Allaah says in His Noble book,    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> <b>O you who believe, fulfil your covenants</b> <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
And Allaah said,    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> <b>Fulfil the covenant of Allaah</b> <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
And the Messenger of Allaah, Muhammad warned against treachery and deception. The  Messenger of Allaah said that the one who breaks his covenant or contract and is deceitful  that Allaah, the most High, will expose him upon the Day of Judgement. And Allaah will  make him known on the Day of Judgement amongst all of the creation, that he was  deceitful.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>The third issue</u></font>    <P>
That <b>these types of crimes involve great oppression</b>. And oppression is  from the greatest of all sins.    <P>
In the authentic collections of al-Bukhari and Muslim, the Prophet said,    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>Oppression is darkness on the Day of Judgement</b></blockquote>    <P>
And in the authentic collection of Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad said,    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>Allaah, the Most High, said, "O my servants, I have made oppression upon myself  something impermissible and I have made it impermissible for you to oppress one another.  So do not oppress one another (meaning that some of you should not oppress others)"</b></blockquote>    <P>
Our religion of Islaam prohibits transgression and oppression. It prohibits oppression even if this transgression is against someone that we hate. It is still impermissible. We have to be just when dealing with everyone.    <P>
Allaah, the Most High, said,    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> <b>And do not let the hatred of a people cause you not to be just. Be just, because it is closer to piety</b> <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
And the meaning of this noble verse: If you and another individual hate one another, it is  still not permissible to oppress him or transgress against him. And it is not permissible to  oppress him; rather it is obligatory that you deal with him justly. It is obligatory upon an  individual to still fulfil their covenant or contract that he has with them, even if you hate  them.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>The fourth affair</u></font>    <P>
That <b>these types of crimes and activities distort the true image of  Islaam</b>. And this is in reality oppression. Oppression to Islaam and the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, because the people now, at this point, if it is said to them that these bombings are from Islaam, then it will result in the people hating Islaam. And they will hate the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. And they will run away from Islaam. And they will have a feeling towards Islaam of enmity and rancour.  Likewise these crimes involve lying upon Allaah and lying upon the Messenger.    <P>
It is obligatory upon the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, all of them, that they honour their agreements, and they  honour their contracts, and that they speak truthfully when they speak. The true Muslim is  not treacherous, and he is not deceitful, and he does not lie, and he does not oppress. This  is what Islaam teaches and this is something this is clear from the religion. As for those  activities such as bombing and what is similar, they distort the true religion of Islaam and  they ascribe to Islam which in reality is not from it. Because verily the true <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, those  who understand the reality of the religion of Islaam, in every place, they hate and reject  and they criticise these criminal acts and they warn against them. And they warn against  those people who call to these acts.     <P>
And the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in every place feel sorry and sad when  they hear about the affairs of these criminal activities no matter where they occur or  happen upon the earth. Whether it takes place in the Muslim world or whether it takes  place in other than the Muslim world. And our scholars have clarified and clearly explained,  with clear clarifications which are strong and emphatic, that these types of acts are not  from Islaam. And the scholars in truth they should be returned to.    <P>
The scholars in truth they should be returned to and they are those people to whom we  should always turn back. We should return back to them to understand the rulings of  Allaah, the One who is free from all imperfections. Because the scholars possess  knowledge. Knowledge which allows them to differentiate between that which is truth and  that which is falsehood. And they can distinguish between that which is from the religion of  Islaam and that which is not. And we are delighted and happy with what occurred today,  when we heard from the mufti of Saudi Arabia, his eminence the Shaykh Abdul Azeez Aal  ash-shaykh (May Allaah the Most High who is free from all imperfections preserve him). The  Shaykh issued a clarification which has been spread through the media, through the media  outlets here in Saudi Arabia.     <P>
The Shaykh, his eminence, criticised and detested those  explosions which occurred in London. And the Shaykh explained that Islaam is free of these  of these activities. So may Allaah reward the Shaykh, the mufti of Saudi Arabia, with good.  And we ask Allaah, the Most High, that He grants all of the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> success to understand  the Book of Allaah, and to understand the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah. And that  Allaah grants them success and allows them to implement the religion of Islaam in the  correct manner, how it should be implemented.    <P>
Far away and distant from <a href='../tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> and far away from fanaticism, the true religion of  Islaam is a religion of mercy, a religion of justice and a religion that commands that the  contracts be fulfilled and kept. The religion of Islaam is not a religion that allows lies, it is  not a religion that is barbaric and it is not a religion of treachery.    <P>
So my brothers, this is the real Islaam that we have explained to you today. And we say  that those who did these crimes and took part in these explosions and these people who  have caused Islaam to carry the burden of their crimes, in reality they have not harmed  anyone but themselves. Because the religion of Allaah and the true <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> are free from  these actions, from these barbaric crimes. And I ask Allaah, the Most High, that He  preserves the security and safety, and that Allaah preserves the state of contentment. I  would suffice with what I have said. And the salaat and the salaam of Allaah upon our  Prophet Muhammad.    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'><u>Questions and Answers</u></font>    <P>
<b>Question. What is the Islaamic punishment for those who take part in these crimes?</b>    <P>
Answer. Allaah, the Most High, said,    <P>
<div class='quotequran'><img src='../images/qnstart.gif'> <b>Those who are at war with Allaah and His Messenger and spread corruption in the earth;  they will be killed, or they will be hung, or their hands and their legs will be cut off, or  they will be exiled from the land</b> <img src='../images/qnend.gif'></div>    <P>
Those people who are caught or take part in these activities, like bombings, which take  innocent lives their punishment is death. Because they are individuals who spread  corruption in the society. They are not allowed to remain. That is why Allaah commanded  that the people who do these types of acts be killed. And if they do not repent from these  types of acts then in the hereafter is waiting for them a severe torment.    <P>
<b>Question. How do we act with those people who rejoiced at yesterdays events?</b>    <P>
Answer. No-one would be happy with these occurrences except one who is severely  ignorant. The one who is ignorant of the true understanding of Islaam, he is the only one  who would be pleased with the likes of these activities. Allaah does not like oppression and  the Messenger Muhammad did not like oppression. Likewise the believers from the <a href='../tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>,  they hate any type of oppression and they do not rejoice when it appears.    <P>
What right does anyone have to kill innocent people who are in a state of security? And  what right do the people have to kill innocent women who likewise believe they are in a  state of security? And what right do the people have to kill innocent children who are  likewise in a state of security? Those who board the car or that which is similar, and the  trains, and these people walk in the streets, and they seek their daily needs. These people,  what right does anyone have to kill them.     <P>
They haven't committed any crime that warrants this type of atrocity. So the one who is happy at the like of this occurrence either they are extremely ignorant or they are people who love transgression are oppression. And they love barbaric acts. And we ask Allaah that he guides them and he rectifies their state. And Allaah knows best.</blockquote> <P>
