<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>A former Royal Marine from County Antrim who made bombs for dissident republicans has been sentenced to 18 years in prison.  Ciar?n Maxwell, from Larne, admitted a series of terror charges ahead of a pre-sentence hearing that began last Wednesday.  After his arrest last year, police found 43 weapons hides.    <P>
On Monday, an Old Bailey judge told Maxwell he must serve a further five years on licence after his release.    <P>
The judge said Maxwell was motivated by hostility to the United Kingdom and had betrayed his position in the armed forces.    <P>
He told the former lance corporal that the purpose of a pipe bomb - 14 of which were constructed by Maxwell - was "to maim and kill a potential victim".    <P>
The judge rejected Maxwell's account that he was motivated by post traumatic stress disorder resulting from a sectarian beating he received as a teenager.    <P>
He said Maxwell was "dangerous" and threatened the political stability of Northern Ireland.    <P>
The judge added that Maxwell had "considerable skills as a terrorist bomb maker" and enjoyed his work.    <P>
"There was considerable planning, including attack planning, research, and the acquiring of large amounts of materials, including police items for use in disguise," Mr Justice Nigel Sweeney said.    <P>
"You were strongly committed to the cause.  </blockquote>    <P>
