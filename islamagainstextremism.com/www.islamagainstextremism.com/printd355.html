<p><div align=center><img src=assets/sysimages/aal-hamd.gif border=0></div>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad is a Salafi scholar from the city of al-Madinah, KSA. He issued a statement (<a href=http://al-abbaad.com/index.php/articles/125-1435-09-28>see here</a>) regarding the alleged khilaafah announced by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote>The following is a summary of the essential points:    <P>
<ol><li> That a sect appeared a number of years ago calling itself the Islamic State of <a href='tags/iraq-mo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/iraq.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Iraq</font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> (ISIS, Daish), those behind it were all unkowns, identified only by nicknames.    <P>
<li> Many foreigners entered <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> during the revolt against the government and they began to fight against Ahl al-Sunnah who were opposed to the Nusayri government and began to attack and splinter them.     <P>
<li> Then in this month of Ramadan (1435H/2014CE) they began to call themselves the Islamic Khilafah, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an imposter under whose command or <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a> many were killed in barbaric ways. It is better for this sect to recant and return otherwise it will simply be blown away by the wind as has happened to sects like them before.    <P>
<li> It is unfortunate that this alleged khilafah has received acceptance by the youth in the land of the Haramayn, they showed their happiness and joy like a thirsty person who sees a mirage of water, and some of them claim that pledge of allegiance is due to this unknown khalifah. How can goodness be hoped in from those who have been put to trial with <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir-ix.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Takfir</font></a></font></a> and slaughter in the vilest of ways?! The youth should free themselves from them and not follow any one who shouts and screams.    <P>
<li> The Shaykh mentions an report about a group of people who got affected by the views of the <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-bk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> (takfir of major sinners) until they met with a companion, Jabir bin Abdullaah, who directed them and they left their views and left the <a href='tags/kharijites-no.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-bk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a>.    <P>
<li> Then the Shaykh cited texts to show the danger of <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> (ghuluww) in the religion and the important to return to the people of <a href='tags/knowledge.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>knowledge</font></a>.    <P>
<li> Then the Shaykh cited texts that indicate the sanctity of life and the gravity of murder and taking life without due right.    <P>
<li> The Shaykh advised those youth to recant and to come back to their right guidance and not be led to their destruction, that they should maintain their obligation of hearing and obeying those in authority over them and to  maintain the order and security of their nation.    <P>
</ol>    <P>
Abu Iyaad    <P>
