<p><font style='font-size:18px;line-height:25px;'>Bin Laden journal reveals he was shaped by the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> </font><BR>  New evidence also confirms Al Qaeda maintained ties with the Iranian regime and <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> names Necmettin Erbakan, the former prime minister of Turkey, as a source of inspiration.    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>On Wednesday, the Central Intelligence Agency released nearly half a million files recovered from the 2011 raid that led to the killing of Osama <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.    <P>
While researchers are still ploughing through the massive pile of data, some fascinating titbits have already surfaced about the life of <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> and the networks of the international organisation he had established. These revelations include new evidence confirming the global terror organisation maintained ties with the Iranian regime throughout the years.    <P>
In particular, details found in a handwritten journal he kept shed light on the ideological origins of the man who globalised Islamic jihadism in a way that nobody had before.    <P>
In the journal, <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> offers answers to a series of questions about the ideas and movements that influenced him. For example, he lists the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> as an organisation that shaped some of his thinking in the early days of his radicalisation. More astonishingly, he reveals an unexpected and hitherto unknown source of inspiration: Necmettin Erbakan, the former prime minister of Turkey who could be regarded as the father of modern Turkish Islamism.    <P>
Bin Laden's membership of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> was first confirmed by the current leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman Al Zawahiri, in a video released in 2014. "Sheikh Osama <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a> was part of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> organisation in the Arabian Peninsula," Zawahiri said in the video. "When the Russian invasion of Afghanistan happened, the sheikh travelled immediately to Pakistan, met the mujahideen and started helping them."  </blockquote>    <P>
