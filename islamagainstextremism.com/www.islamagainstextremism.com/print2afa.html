<img src=assets/images/islam-isis-front-cover-3d.png align="right" style="padding:0px 0xp 12px 12px;" border=0> <b>A Brief Guide to Islam and Its Position Towards <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a> and ISIS</b>    <P>
This is a much needed, concise and useful handbook for presenting an understanding of the basic foundations of Isl&#257;m to non-Muslim audiences of varying backgrounds. It discusses the historical origins of <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a> and <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a>, which return to the misguided early Kh&#257;rijite sect and its extremist doctrines. It also addresses many misconceptions held by non-Muslims due to media coverage of the <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> and <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> of these groups. The book will also be helpful for Muslim institutions such as mosques and schools. It can be used by these organisations to educate their audiences on how to challenge this extremist ideology and how to buffer their communities from the mendacious propaganda and dedicated recruiting efforts of this very small, outcast, yet very vocal band of extremists.    <P>
<b>Contents</b>    <P>
The first twenty or so pages provide a basic introduction to Islam. The next thirty pages or so detail the historical appearance of this ideology in the form of the Kharijite sect. Their statements and activities show how the doctrines of <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> in <a href='tags/takfir-ix.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font></a>, "ruling by Allaah's law" and "<a href="tags/jihad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">jihad</font></a>" were part and parcel of their claim of "establishing a caliphate". This provides the background for analysing and evaluating the revival of this same doctrine in the 20th century at the hands of ignorant thinkers and how this led ultimately to the appearance of <a href='tags/al-qaeda.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Qaeda</font></a> and <a href='tags/isis-ll.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/isis-mt.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/isis.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">ISIS</font></a></font></a></font></a>. Then a variety of misconceptions are dealt with, those that are common on minds and tongues of non-Muslims on account of what they see, hear and read through the print and digital media outlets. <b><a href=assets/images/page-03.png>View table of contents</a></b>.    <P>
