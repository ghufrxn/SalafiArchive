<p>Majority of Terrorists Who Have Attacked America Are Not Muslim, New Study Finds<BR>  Mythili Sampathkumar, New York, 23 June 2017 - <a href=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/terrorism-right-wing-america-muslims-islam-white-supremacists-study-a7805831.html#commentsDiv>The Independent</a>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Most of the designated terrorist groups in the US are right-wing extremists, not Muslim, according to a new report.    <P>
A joint project by the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute, a nonprofit media centre, and news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting took a look at the 201 designated <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> incidents within the US from 2008 to 2016.    <P>
The results: "right-wing extremists were behind nearly twice as many incidents" as terror acts associated with those identified as "Islamist domestic terrorism".</blockquote>    <P>
