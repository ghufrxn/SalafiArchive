<p><div class='sidebar'>From the <b>early to mid-1990s</b> and over the next 20 years - picking up especially after the events of 11 September 2001 - there has been a <b>steady, persistent stream of literature</b> focused around the <b>condemnation and refutation of the terrorist ideology</b>. Academic battles raged in England between the extremists (those promoting the ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and <a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a> [Hizb al-Tahrir]) and Salafis who saw these ideologies as deviant, extreme and the precursor to violent acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>. The former were led by deviants with a revolutionary mindset following the teachings of <b><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a></b>, <b>Abu A'laa Mawdudi</b> and <b>al-Nabahani</b> and many had been given asylum in Britain. They include <b><a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a></b>, <b>Abu Hamzah</b>, <b>Faisal the Jamaican</b>, <b>Muhammad al-Mis'ari</b> and others. It is these people, along with others such as <b>Ali al-Timimi</b> and <b>JIMAS</b> who were responsible for producing a generation of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> poisoned by the ideologies of the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> (al-Ikhwan), at the centre of which was the Kharijite terrorist ideology of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>. Fierce battles were fought by those who value the Prophetic traditions against these extremist ideologies which combined between the deviation of the early <a href='tags/kharijites-bk.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink"><a href="tags/kharijites.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a></font></a> and European revolutionary ideologies.</div>    <P>

The above images are of a book that was produced in October 2001 with a second, updated and expanded edition in May 2003, by Salafi Publications, Birmingham UK. Consisting of 35 pages (2nd edition), the book contains Prophetic traditions that warn against the Kharijite terrorists (this group was prophesised by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him), the statements of political figures condemning the terrorists and religious verdicts from scholarly authorities on acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> in both Muslim and non-Muslim lands. The terrorist ideology of Osama <a href='tags/bin-ladin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Ladin</font></a> was also highlighted along with refutations against him by scholars such as Abd al-Aziz bin Baz. Verdicts were presented regarding <a href='tags/suicide-bombings.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>suicide bombings</font></a>, hijackings, blowing up cars and what is similar. And finally, advice to <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> living in non-Muslim countries from the great scholar Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymin (<a href=indexc005.html?mbowy>which can be found here</a>). The battle against this ideology was fought vehemently throughout the 1990s and 2000s and will be known to anyone who was present on the scene during those years. <P>
