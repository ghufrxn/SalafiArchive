<div class='sidebar'><blockquote> <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> should <u>put the dots on the letters</u> and <u>connect the lines</u> and not hold back in describing the extremists with the appropriate labels after naming them, out of protection for Islam and its adherents (<a href=index13f7.html?leuiyij>see this article</a>).      <P>
The following five individuals are established as being the major influences upon <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a> - this is from his own tongue as has come to light recently from individuals who had interacted with and debated him in his extremist views (nine days prior to the atrocity he committed) - and they are <b><a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a></b>, <b>Abu Hamza</b>, <b><a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a></b>, <b><a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a></b> (pictures are in same order).    <P>

The doctrines, methodologies and verdicts of these extremists are behind the actions taken by <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a> who in reality was  just a street-thug turned Muslim subsequently sucked in by these extremist groups whose aims are not to give the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> an objective broad education on the basic creed and tenets of Islam (that would prevent them from extremist views and tendencies), but a highly politicized, radical indoctrination in <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> within a Marxist, Leninist, Communist framework of  <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> (against Muslim authorities), their distorted doctrines of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> simply being a means to that end. The end result is, as the Scholar, Muhammad bin Rabee' pointed out, the presence of individuals walking around with "<b>intoxicating emotions</b>" which are far removed and divorced from Islaam (<a href=index7f00.html?zltsjfs>see this article</a>).     <P>

<blockquote>Before we mention a few brief words about each of these extremists, a little background would help to place matters into context and will also make it easier for  <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who may be sympathetic towards or attached to these figures to understand the nature of their misguidance and <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> and deviation away from the foundations and principles of Islam and the Sunnah.     <P>
First, the ideas of these extremists are founded on the ideologies of four thinkers from the early 20th century and they are <b><u><a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a></u>, <u><a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a></u> and <u>Abu A'laa Mawdudi</u></b>. These men operated largely upon the assumption that there is no legitimate Islamic government in existence today (all Muslim nations are apostate nations) and as part of their so-called methodologies of reform they borrowed wholesale from the Marxists and <a href='tags/communists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communists</font></a> and incorporated revolutionary ideologies and methodologies and began weaving them into their works. This led to the distortion of many sound Islamic principles that relate to issues such as <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> (excommunication), <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> (a just conventional war to protect the interests of a state), walaa and baraa (loyalty and disownment). Part and parcel of these ideologies is to turn the masses away from the bona-fide orthodox Sunni Scholars and direct them instead to the works and writings of non-scholars, pseudo-scholars and thinkers. Severing <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> from their scholars is the easiest way to amass followers in order to lead them into Marxist, Communist type revolutions, which is the aim of these parties and groups. These ideas unfortunately spread to most Muslim nations through the activities of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon and Hizb al-Tahrir. When these ideas spread to certain lands such as Saudi Arabia, some of those who were apparently upon orthodox Sunni Islam (<a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>) became poisoned by these teachings through the books of <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, Mawdudi and the activities of Mohammad <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a> and his likes. As a result, these people in turn began to distort the foundations of Islaam and the Sunnah in order to incorporate the extremist and revolutionary ideas of those thinkers (Qutb, al-Banna, al-Nabahani, Mawdudi) into methodologies of reform. It is  unfortunate that the people of this ideology are referred to by the media and also by ignorant and naive journalists as "Salafis." These people are the greatest of disputants and enemies to the Salafis and their scholars. These are in fact neo-Kharijites, Qutbists and are far removed from the way of the Salaf. As a result of the activities of these individuals and their organizations, there has arisen mass confusion amongst the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in general since they are largely uneducated about the foundational principles of orthodox Islam that relate to these grave and serious matters, leaving them vulnerable and at the mercy of these extremists, who have worked hard to undermine the trust of the general <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> masses in the orthodox senior Scholars of the Sunnah. These extremists use the plight of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who are being oppressed in certain parts of the world as a means to misguide <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in their religion by drawing them into their web of <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> - since creating ideological revolutions, amassing followers and then  mobilizing them into physical revolutions is the true and real goal of these people - this is what they wish and hope for, and they are inspired by the recent revolutions in <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, Tunisia and Libya. To mobilize people in this direction, they start off using the powerfully emotive aspects of non-Muslim conquests in Muslim lands (an easy way to win sentiments of Muslim masses), they make judgements of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> (of <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a>, scholars and government institutions) and pass incorrect verdicts of <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a>, often in deceptive ways (see notes on <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> below).    <P>
<b>A Crucial Point to Understand:</b> This is very crucial point for you to understand whether you are a Muslim or a non-Muslim and it is related to the argument used to explain the actions of terrorists that they do what they do because of the foreign policy of non-Muslim nations in Muslim lands. We will address this argument in more detail in other articles, it is connected to the point we are going to make now, which is: You should know and understand that these misguided extremists are grieved that Western nations are meddling in Muslim lands because this stands in the way of their own goals and designs which are to topple "apostate" governments in the Muslim lands and snatch the authority from them so as to "establish the Shariah" as they claim. They are sat in the heart of London actively promoting <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a> and <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> in the Muslim lands, and some of them were doing this well before 9/11 and 7/7. Even if there had not been a single American, British or European soldier in any of the Muslim lands today, these people would be behind the encouragement of killing and murder of "apostates" in the Muslim lands, because this ideology was present a long time before terrorist activitites in the Western lands (take <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> in the early 1990s for example). You see these extremists have declared the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> and the scholars (by and large), and all government institutions and those working for such institutions in the various Muslim lands as apostates whose lives must be taken. The greatest <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in their eyes, with the greatest priority, is to fight and kill these "apostates" and overturn their rule. But what has happened is that Western geo-political objectives in these lands have derailed the train of these extremist <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a> and so they have simply had to alter and adapt their goals slightly. Their greatest resentment is against those <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> they deem "apostates," they consider them a greater enemy, and as for non-Muslim nations meddling in other nations (whom these <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a> consider apostate states to begin with) they have just gotten in the way of a more loftier goal (in the eyes of those takfiris).    <P>
So the point to be taken from this is do not be deceived by the rhetoric of these people regarding the injustice in the foreign policy of Western nations. If none of that existed, it would actually be the doctrines, ideas and policies espoused by these extremists that would be behind the killing of innocent men, women (and children) in the Muslim lands. <a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a>, the  barbaric four-legged beast (<a href=index2a2f.html?bqael>see here</a>), gave verdicts for the killing of the families (wives and children) of Egyptian police and similar verdicts in <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a> on the basis that they are apostates and hence, their wives and children are legitimate targets. This was <u>well before</u> the West started seeing <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> (done oppressively in the name of Islam). This mindset is the one being preached by these extremists and though some of them (named below) will not explicitly state this, <u>it is the final logical outcome</u> of the types of extremist ideas they espouse regarding <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in general.     <P>
We could write a lot more, but it would detract from the purpose of this article. What is above is sufficient to help put into context the remarks that will be made about each of these individuals in what follows.  </blockquote>    <P>

As has come to light recently, <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a> was infuenced by <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> in the latter's verdicts of <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a>, and is part of what led him to believe that unless you participate in <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> today you are sinful, and that <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> is fard al-ayn (an individual obligation). This is certainly the idea that is presented by extremists like <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> and the stink of their hypocrisy almost hammers you when you see them preaching these ideas to the masses, yet they do not embark to their own claimed <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> which they are so keen to propagate to naive and ignorant <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. With all that bravado and so called concern for oppressed <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> all over the world, when have you ever seen these extremists leave the comfort of living in Britain with its benefits and securities in order to "lead by example"? This is just a side point about the hypocrisy and fake piety exemplified by these people.    <P>
To understand <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> we have to understand a trait of the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihadis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadis</font></a> in general, because <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> is an exception to the norm amongst the <a href='tags/kharijites.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/kharijites-no.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Kharijites</font></a></font></a>. When you look at the  majority of <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihadis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadis</font></a> they hold great resentment towards the Salafi scholars such as Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a> and others. Some of them declare these scholars to be apostates and others claim that these scholars were misguided or were paid by the government and were silenced, and they actively denigrate these scholars in the eyes of the common people whilst raising ignorant non-scholars such as Osama <a href='tags/bin-laden.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bin Laden</font></a>, <a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a> and others. <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> however takes a more deceptive approach and what he does is rather than take a position against these Scholars, he actually utilizes some of their past stances in relation to <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> as a means of praising them and then using this to propagate to his audience that contrary to what the "Salafis" claim (all <a href='tags/jihadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadi</font></a> <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a> are self-declared enemies of the Salafis) these scholars were in favor of Jihaad. This rhetoric is used to castigate the Salafis (referring to them as "neo-Salafis") who are vocal in exposing their <a href='tags/extremism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>extremism</font></a>, lies and deception and to make it appear that they (the <a href='tags/jihadis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadis</font></a>, Takfiris) have a legitimate orientation in light of the statements of certain Shaykhs such as Shaykh Ibn Baz.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>Now we have to break this down here in more detail so that the deception of <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> becomes readily apparent. Let us make a very short diversion into Jihaad and then we will come back to how <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> positions himself in order to preach what are in reality the doctrines and methodologies of the likes of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> and others which is <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and jihaad upon other than Sharee'ah principles.</div>    <P>
Jihad is from the greatest foundations of Islam and whilst <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> simply to means "to struggle" from a linguistic point of view, and can refer to any effort or struggle made (spiritual or otherwise), its peak refers to a physical conventional war aimed at protecting the interests of the state, to repel harm from a warring, transgressing enemy. All nations have a clear policy of national security and waging a just war and in Islam this is exemplified in the institution of <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a>. In any nation, serving  to defend the nation is seen as the highest honor. For a Muslim to wage <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> (in a just conventional war behind a clear leadership) is from the peak of Islam - and of course no sane person has an issue with the concept of a person defending his nation from aggression. Having said this, <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in Islam is not "blind" and "absolute" and has principles, conditions and requirements and it is only for <b>the Scholars and Rulers</b> to make decisions in grave and serious matters affecting the state and its subjects. <b>From such conditions are:</b> <u>a)</u> that this <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> is against a warring, transgressing enemy with whom there is no previous peace treaty, covenant, guarantee and the likes <u>b)</u> that fighting has to be behind the ruler or military leader and requires his permission except in the case of sudden attack where subjects must defend themselves as a matter of emergency, though they are subsequently required to consult immediately with the ruler and refer affairs back to those in authority <u>c)</u> there must be sufficient military strength to participate in the war, <u>d)</u> there must be a clear, distinct military leadership behind whom the war is made and not mass confusion with lots of separate factions. These are just some of the numerous requirements for <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> and it is not for any common person or preacher to start announcing <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> to the people at large as this is chaos and confusion and corruption. However, this is what is done by these extremist preachers. They blur everything and do not make rulings upon actual ground realities and are driven by raw emotion and what they see of injustice and oppression to fall into another type of oppression - which is oppressing themselves and others by faking scholarship and pretending to be fit and capable of giving verdicts in grave and serious matters that can affect the security and welfare of whole nations of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>.    <P>
<b>Returning to <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a>.</b> This deceptive individual has a calculated method of misguiding his audience so what he will do is mention how the Scholars like Shaykh Ibn Baz and Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen supported <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> - and this is certainly true - for they supported the <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in Afghanistan and likewise in Bosnia - and this is really where the deception lies, which is that the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah, when they announce the legitimacy of a <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a>, it is upon the principles and conditions we have mentioned, since the Scholars are the furthest away from spreading chaos, confusion and corruption on the land and hence the <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> in Afghanistan was in line with the conditions we mentioned earlier, it was one nation (Afghanistan) fighting another transgression nation (Russia) and there was a clear presence of military leadership with the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> and likewise with Bosnia. In all these cases it is true that some of the Scholars expressed support and this is on the basis that the required conditions mentioned previously were largely present and the scholars believed these conditions to be present on account of information brought to them.     <P>
However, from here, the intent of <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> is to hoodwink his audience into thinking that what he and his likes promote of the idea of Jihaad in other situations (which are unlike Afghanistan in the 80s and Bosnia in the 90s and which do not fulfil many of the required conditions) is legitimate and sanctioned. And further, that <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> is a worldwide, individual obligation upon every Muslim (something none of those Salafi scholars hold). It is for this reason you will not see <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> referring back to <a href='tags/shaykh-saalih-al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</font></a> or Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aal al-Shaykh and other contemporary Salafi scholars, despite making a pretence of following Shaykh Ibn Baz in issues which are past and bygone. The past positions of those scholars who passed away (Shaykh Ibn Baz) in issues which are passed and bygone are used by cunning deceivers like <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> to promote the idea of a constant framework of Jihaad in the minds of ignorant charged up <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. And no doubt this influenced the mind of <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a> who explicitly stated only nine days before his act of murder that <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> is his reference point for the particular idea of <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> he was espousing (which by the way justifies killing of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> too).     <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Alert:</b> One of the underlying realities about these deviants - which very few are wise to - is that knowing they are operating in London, and knowing there are legal consequences for what they say and do, people like <a href='tags/shakeel-begg.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shakeel Begg</font></a> and other fanatics have adopted dissimulation as a methodology by which to protect themselves. Knowing that overtly <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> and <a href='tags/jihadi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihadi</font></a> stances are detrimental to them, they make a pretense of having a more liberal stance and of having toned down. These people are like scorpions as has been said of them by the Salafi Scholars of old and they certainly do not deceive those well-informed about them and their inner-realities. If they have truly changed, then let them put it on pen and paper and refute every single instance of misguidance they espoused, sign it and then distribute it openly. So long as they do not explicitly and publicly recant those views, they still harbor and conceal them,  making their evil and corruption much worse.</div>    <P>

He holds the doctrine of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> (excommunication) of contemporary Muslim nation states and their governments and he has been involved in the organization and facilitation of subversive activities in these Muslim lands - all from the comfort of London. He set up an organization in the 1990s called "Supporters of the Shariah" following the general trend in the thought of <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>, al-Nabahani, al-Mawdudi.

All of their subversive activities which they try to justify using Islamic texts (and the notion of Jihad) fall generally within the umbrella of that Marxist, Communist, Leninist methodology (<a href=http://www.takfiris.com/takfir/?qyowp>see this article</a>) and their primary focus is upon Muslim governments, in line with this ideology they have taken from the works of thinkers like <a href='tags/qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutb</font></a>, al-Nabahani and Mawdudi. <b>It is primarily for that reason they are based in non-Muslim countries out of the reach of Muslim authorities</b>. Abu Hamza has many remarks glorifying acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> where innocent men, women and children have been killed and he states that these actions are respectable and that their perpetrators are "martyrs" even though he "does not condone them". We believe that these qualifications made by some of these extremist preachers "<i>we do not condone this act</i>", "<i>we do not support such actions</i>" are merely a veil by which they aim to protect themselves from a legal point of view, <b>since by glorifying the perpetrators of these actions, you are stating that you agree wholeheartedly with the legitimacy of these actions</b>, otherwise it is a contradiction to say that you do not condone these actions and then praise and glorify the ones who did the actions. Further, it is here that their hypocrisy also becomes manifest and their fake veneration of the <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> becomes known because if they were honest and truthful, they would have been explicitly vocal in expressing the actual <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> ruling on terrorist activities and exonerating the Islamic <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> from such barbaric acts. And this is a proof that they do not actually venerate the Islamic <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> in reality, but it is just a slogan used as part and parcel of a wider heresy, which is the claim that toppling states, governments and regimes through revolutions in order to snatch power is what the call of the Prophets and Messengers was centered around.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/abu-qatadah.png align=left style="margin:0px 12px 0px 0px;" border=0><b>Abu Qatadah:</b> This is truly the worst of creatures, and we have spoken about him in a separate article (<a href=index2a2f.html?bqael>here</a>). <a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a> is a bloodthirsty <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> who has passed verdicts allowing the killing of the wives and children of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> working for the police in countries such as <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> and <a href='tags/algeria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Algeria</font></a>. This is the same <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> doctrine that came out of Egyptian prisons on account of the writings of the Rafidee Kharijite, <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a> - the ideological father of contemporary <a href='tags/takfiri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiri</font></a> groups.

For this reason he has been a very major influence upon extremists in Muslim land such as Saudi Arabia where many of the terrorist acts and bombings have been traced back to his influence.<b> We made the point earlier and we will make it again, had there not been a single American, British or European soldier in any of the Muslim lands, and had there not been any meddling of any Western nation in the economy or politics of any Muslim land, we would have seen atrocities coming from the hands of these bloodthirsty takfiris</b>. So we should not be deceived by this rhetoric that terrorists are motivated by the foreign policy of Western nations. Rather terrorists are motivated by a certain sick and corrupt ideology, otherwise, if their argument was true then the millions of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> found in non-Muslim lands would all have been involved in actions of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a>, but that is clearly not the case despite these millions of <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> opposing and disagreeing with such foreign policies. To learn more about <a href='tags/abu-qatadah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatadah</font></a> refer to <a href=index2a2f.html?bqael>this article</a> and refer to the book "<i>Clearing the Servants From The Barbarity of <a href='tags/abu-qatada.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Qatada</font></a> Who Calls For the Killing of Women and Children</i>," a detailed refutation of this sick and diseased beast to whom the lives of Muslim women and children in Muslim lands are worth nothing.    <P>
<img src=assets/images/omar-bakri.png align=left style="margin:0px 12px 0px 0px;" border=0><b><a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a></b>: In order to understand <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> and <a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a> (see below) we have to really understand the man upon whose books these deviant extremists have been nurtured. This man is <a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a>. He was a Ba'thist Communist in the late 1940s and was involved in nationalist movements in Palestine. The political party he later set up in the early 1950s was founded upon the organizational structure of those Ba'thist underground movements and it followed the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary discourse as its program, and imposed this discourse onto a new (futile) reading of the seerah (biography) of the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). The Tahriris distorted and fabricated a great lie against the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) by claiming that <u>a)</u> he came and preached underground with a few followers, then <u>b)</u> he took this preaching out in the open in the ideological stage to the masses and <u>c)</u> which finally paved the way for the <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> and setting up the state. In this way, they lied and fabricated against the Prophetic seerah and used it as a propaganda tool to dupe <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> into working wihin their party whose methodology is taken from Marx, <a href='tags/lenin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Lenin</font></a> and the Socialist <a href='tags/communists.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Communists</font></a> and not from the Prophets and Messengers. So this is what al-Nabahani brought and his ideological works are used to indoctrinate people through a careful selection process. You can learn more about al-Nabahani <a href=(sallallaahu.html alayhi wasallam)>in this article</a>. <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> was responsible for bringing this ideology into the British universities during the 1990s and <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> himself is a fake scholar who lied about his scholarly credentials. <u>He actually has none</u>. He worked as an engineer in Saudi Arabia where he tried his subversive ideology and then fled and came to Britain where he faked being a scholar and then commenced his bid to amass a following. The author of the book "<i>Hizb al-Tahrir</i>" (in Arabic) has exposed this miscreant sufficiently and aptly and established him as a calculated liar with evidences from all of his video and audio recordings. During the 1990s intense debates would take place between Salafis and these extremists (Omar Bakri and followers) who were (and still are) upon a Communist, Marxist, Leninist methodology clothed in the garb of Islaam. However, over the past 10 years, given that many <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> have woken up to their reality, they started operating under different labels and names, "<a href="tags/al-muhajiroun.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Muhajiroun</font></a>", "Islam4Uk", "the Saved Sect", "Ahl al-Sunnah" and more recently under the deceptive label "Salafi Media." From the tail-ends of <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> is <a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a>. During his stay in Britain, <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> provided the media with everything they needed to demonize <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> at large and to help polarize sentiments against them through his outrageous remarks and comments during interviews. Far from being the so called "eyes" and "ears" of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> (a popular Hizb al-Tahrir slogan from the 90s) he (and his followers) were in fact a festering boil.     <P>
<img src=assets/images/anjem-choudary.png align=left style="margin:0px 12px 0px 0px;" border=0><b><a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a></b>: This individual is a by-product of the festering boil that is <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a>, he is a Tahriri upon the  Communist, Marxist methodology of <a href='tags/taqi-al-din-al-nabahani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani</font></a> and he is responsible for the victimization of innocent <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> around Britain and for the hardships faced by average everyday <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> on account of the xenophobia, racism and religious hatred coming from non-Muslims who are outraged, enraged and mobilized by the foolishness coming from this man's mouth. There are many good reasons to cast doubt upon this man his intentions and integrity and the explanation of this is as follows: A person like <a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a> is not foolish enough not to realize that his publicity-hungry, provocative attitude does nothing but instill further hatred into the hearts of millions of non-Muslims against Islam and the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> in these Western lands which in turn puts their lives and well-being at risk. A person simply cannot be so dumb so as not to realize that these are the clear consequences from his actions. Assuming this, Choudary's actions are very suspect, since they do not serve any useful cause (not even his own). Either we have a completely dumb beast or we have a very shady character, so we leave his intentions and his affair with Allaah.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>It is not an unfair comment to say the British media <b>is complicit in acts of <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> committed by extremists</b> such as <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a> because they give airtime to controversial pretenders to knowledge such as <a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a> and <a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a> and their provocative diatribes.

<font class='titleHeadline'>What is the Mindset Created By the Teachings of These Deviants?</font>    <P>
<blockquote>These deviants promote the idea of a worldwide <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a>, whose priority lies in the "apostate" leaders who preside over Muslim lands. Removing them and replacing them is the greatest goal of these people and they see this as the most desired goal of Jihaad. This methodology is opposed to that which the Prophets and Messengers came with as means of rectification. The perception of these people with respect to <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> and social justice is a Marxist Communist one, one that is to be treated with revolutions. Accepting this as the only framework of reform, they then distort Islamic foundations and principles in order to justify this methodology, and here lies their distorted understanding of jihaad and other aspects of Islam. After all, this is what <a href='tags/sayyid-qutb.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'><a href="tags/sayyid-qutb-xk.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Sayyid <a href="tags/qutb.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qutb</font></a></font></a></font></a>, Mawdudi and al-Nabahani founded their methodologies upon (<a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?dsppw>see here</a> and also <a href=http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/?rzaoo>here</a>). The <a href='tags/shariah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shariah</font></a> (legislative) explanation of the reasons and causes of <a href='tags/tyranny.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tyranny</font></a> and injustice clashes with that Marxist, Communist, Leninist perception. <b>But, this is the primary base ideology of these people - <a href='tags/revolution.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>revolution</font></a> to establish social justice - they have simply made it appear Islamic and hijacked aspects of the religion for this end.</b>     <P>
As for non-Muslim conquests in Muslim lands, then they have come in the way of <u>the primary goal</u> of the <a href='tags/takfiris.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfiris</font></a> and have bolstered the argument used by these people to convince others of their extremist methodology. The rhetoric used by these people in relation to these wars of conquest broadens the scope of that worldwide <a href='tags/jihad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jihad</font></a> to include innocent people in non-Muslim lands. In other words, if non-Muslim governments are waging wars in the streets of the lands of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>, then they can wage war in the streets of these non-Muslim lands. Whilst these preachers will not and do not explicitly state this, <b>it is a natural, logical consequence of the doctrines and teachings they espouse</b>  leading to the kind of mindset we see in misguided, deluded fools such as <a href='tags/michael-adebolajo.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Michael Adebolajo</font></a>. Mix this ideology with a couple of bad experiences (as happened to Adebolajo) and you've got a volatile, ready to explode individual from whom you can expect almost anything, even the unthinkable.     <P>
