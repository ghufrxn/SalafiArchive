The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) said, "Each of you is a shepherd and each is responsible for his flock. The leader is the shepherd and responsible for his flock. A man is a shepherd over his family and responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd at her husband?s home and responsible for her flock. A servant is a shepherd over the property of his landlord and responsible for his flock. And a man is a shepherd over the property of his father and responsible for his flock. So, each of you is a shepherd and responsible and will be questioned about his flock."    <P>

Quote: "One of the issues we are required to do is raise our children, cultivating within them  abhorrence for <a href='tags/terrorism.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>terrorism</font></a> and terrorists ? exposing them, their plots, and their patterns. And we must isolate our children from them and distance children from following their way and objective.  It should be clarified for them that these terrorists are a people astray, deviously perverting (Islam). Devils have influenced them, seduced and misled them. Satan uses such people to spread evil and corruption. Even those who show enmity towards Muslims like Zionists and others may be happy to see such bombings and destruction commit by terrorists in Muslim lands."   <a href=utaybee-despise-terrorists7e27.pdf?a=lsamoh>PDF File</a>.</div> <P>
