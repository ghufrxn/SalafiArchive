<p><div class='sidebar'><b>The Kh&#257;rijites</b> (<a href=http://www.kharijites.com/>see website</a>) are extremists and terrorists whose appearance as an insurgent group and their continued plaguing of the Muslim nation was prophesied by the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;). They excommunicated the leaders of the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> on the basis that they do not abide by justice nor apply all of Isl&#257;m's laws. Upon this, they claimed that Isl&#257;m no longer existed and  can only be returned by toppling the <a href='tags/rulers.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>rulers</font></a> and taking power. They then  categorised people and abodes on the basis of this doctrine founded upon ignorance and misguidance and began to slaughter <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> who did not agree with their ideas and judgments.</div>    <P>
<img src=assets/images/usman-khan-01.png align=right width="250" style="margin:5px 0px 10px 12px" border=0> In the 20th century, aspects of this doctrine were fused with European revolutionary ideology leading to the emergence of groups such as the <a href='tags/muslim-brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslim Brotherhood</font></a> and Hizb al-Ta&#7717;r&#299;r. From the 80's onwards, these ideologies began to appear in the West and affected two generations. The majority of the recruits for ISIS/Daesh across the world have come from this doctrinal background.    <P>
Stoke on Trent has been known historically as <b>a hotbed of Hizb al-Ta&#7717;r&#299;r and al-Mu&#7717;ajiroun Kh&#257;rijite extremists</b>. Usman Khan is a follower of <b><a href='tags/anjem-choudary.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Anjem Choudary</font></a></b> who in turn is a student of <b><a href='tags/omar-bakri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Omar Bakri</font></a></b>,  a charlatan who came to the UK in the 80s pretending to be a scholar. Thousands of sheep flocked around Bakri during the 1990s and the Salafis played an instrumental role in  refuting and exposing their devious ideology through lectures, audio recordings, leaflets books and online publishing.     <P>

The act of Usman Kh&#257;n, as it has been reported in media outlets, is from the greatest acts of treachery, diametrically opposed to the spirit of the teachings of Isl&#257;m. This was a calculated act of treachery on his behalf and must be condemned without hesitation. Pretending to participate with other former prisoners, teachers and counsellors, but secretly plotting to kill people is a heinous crime.     <P>
As contemporary Muslim scholars have explained, there occurs in the story of al-Mugh&#299;rah bin Shu&#703;bah, whilst he was a non-Muslim polytheist, that he accompanied a group of polytheists on a journey to <a href='tags/syria.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Syria</font></a> and killed them, taking their wealth. When he came to the Prophet (&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;), intending to accept Isl&#257;m, he offered the wealth to him and told him of the story. The Prophet ((&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;) said: "As for (your) Isl&#257;m, we accept it, but as for the wealth, it is wealth taken by treachery and we do not have any need of it." This is because this wealth arose through treachery and Isl&#257;m does not permit treachery in any situation whatsoever. Thus treachery and betrayal is not permissible, neither with the non-Muslims nor other than them. Destruction and chaos through this way (of using treachery) is not permissible because innocent women and children are killed. The enemies rejoice with this because it disfigures the picture of Isl&#257;m and its people and it is used against Isl&#257;m. So they give a picture of Isl&#257;m that is blacker than the picture of corrupt religions, and this is the fruit of the actions of those people [the terrorists] upon Isl&#257;m and the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a>. Hence, it is upon the <a href='tags/muslims.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Muslims</font></a> to be the striking example in <a href='tags/truthfulness.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>truthfulness</font></a>, lofty manners, fulfilment of trusts and to remain far away from these attributes of treachery, perfidy, <a href='tags/deception.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>deception</font></a>, lying and taking life which does not benefit Isl&#257;m but harms Isl&#257;m. (Abridged from the cassette "Verdicts of the Scholars on Assassinations and Bombings", Tasj&#299;l&#257;t Minh&#257;j al-Sunnah, Riy&#257;&#7693;).    <P>
These people are as the Prophet of Islam described them, "young in age,  foolish-minded", "dogs of hellfire".    <P>
