<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
The imbecilic and feeble-minded poet (one of many), Abu Muslim al-Hajuri (a follower and student of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi) expressed the following lines:    <P>
<blockquote><div align=center><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>  &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1606;&#1579;&#1606;&#1610; &#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1580;&#1608;&#1585;&#1610; &#1604;&#1581;&#1592;&#1577; &#1593;&#1606; &#1602;&#1608;&#1604; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1592;&#1585;&#1608;&#1601; &#1575;&#1604;&#1590;&#1575;&#1574;&#1602;&#1577;    <P>
&#1604;&#1608; &#1575;&#1606;&#1586;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1605;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1610;&#1585; &#1576;&#1603;&#1601;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1587;&#1600;&#1600;&#1585;&#1609; &#1608;&#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1605;&#1606;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1605;&#1608;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1575;&#1585;&#1602;&#1577; </span></div></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Translation:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Yahya al-Hajuri would not depart - not even for an instance - from speaking (the truth) in dire circumstances, even if they placed the illuminating moon in his left hand and the blazing (east-rising) sun in his right hand.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Notes:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>We see in this line of poetry an attempt to resemble <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). Previously, we saw how imbecilic poets likened Dammaj with the city of Makkah and <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> as the Ka'bah <a href=index41ba.html?mddzw>to whom the people flock to and circumambulate</a>. The phrase, "put the moon in his left hand and the sun in his right hand" has its basis in certain reports which explain that the Mushriks of Makkah made many attempts to stop and hinder the message of Islaam through attempted bribes,  propositions and the likes to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), following which the Messenger stated to his uncle Abu Talib, "If they were to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand to make me leave this matter I would not do so." Now this is narrated in many of the books of the seerah though it is actually inauthentic (see Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth al-Da'eefah (no. 909). In light of all the previous aspects of <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> (extremism, exaggeration) we see a continuing trend (you can refer to all previous articles), and here, he is being spoken of and praised in a way that resembles him more and more with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) in status, rank and behaviour. In fact, forget that, al-Hajuri's <a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>melted flesh morphs into an uncreated attribute</a> of the Lord Most High... so what we are dealing with here in this article is a light matter compared to what has preceded but it nevertheless, continues to show the type of mentality present in the students of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>.     <P>
</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Clarification in Relation to the Hajuri Haddadi Whining and Moaning Taking Place on the Blogs and Forums:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>There is a principle in the Qur'an which the Scholars of the Sunnah have derived from the Qur'anic texts and which the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> (followers of al-Hajuri) should be taught, and it is that "the recompense for an action is of its like" (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1586;&#1575;&#1569; &#1605;&#1606; &#1580;&#1606;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1605;&#1604;</span>)&#1548; and this principle and law is currently in effect and operative as it relates to the dim-witted, imbecilic <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a>.     <P>
They first began their campaign (in the West) against anyone who was connected to Shaykh <a href='tags/ubayd-al-jaabiree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ubayd al-Jaabiree</font></a>  (whom Yahya al-Haddaadi began to speak ill of using foul street language), and hence we saw them targeting certain brothers, trying to find faults and errors, and spreading and distributing rebuttals and attacks. All of this activity was for the sake of al-Hajuri and it was not activity that was founded upon sincerity - this is known with certainty - because these dim-witted idiots (such as Abu Fujoor and his likes) were caught out numerous times and exposed for their insincerity, lies and seeking of fame. So the point here is that the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> embarked on a campaign against the Scholars, including Shaykh Rabee, Shaykh Ubayd, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee, Shaykh Abdullaah al-Bukhaaree, Shaykh Ahmad <a href='tags/bazmul.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bazmul</font></a> and anyone connected to them who saw the truth of what they were saying (upon evidence). Whilst this was taking place for numerous years between 2009 to 2012, the Salafis kept silent and the most they did was to defend the honours of those scholars without actually attacking <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>. So the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a> were seeking to find the faults, errors of those Shaykhs (and the students of knowledge) and all of this was for the sake of al-Hajuri, just like the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> would attack Shaykh Rabee, accusing him of speaking ill of the Companions and the likes, trawling through his cassettes to see if they could find anything with which to disparage him. But those activities were only for the sake of Sayyid Qutb and not for the sake of Allaah. So the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> are behaving like this, their activities are for the sake of Yahyaa al-Haddaadi and this is why even on issues that those Shaykhs (attacked by them) may have already clarified and explained, they continue to use those issues against those Shaykhs as part of their wider campaign to discredit all the other scholars and to put them beneath the feet of Yahya al-Haddadi.    <P>
But the the tables have turned, the principle is in effect, its operative, the law is in operation, (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1586;&#1575;&#1569; &#1605;&#1606; &#1580;&#1606;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1605;&#1604;</span>), the recompense for a deed is of its like, so what is happening now is that the <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> (exaggeration) and humaaqah (stupidity) and jahl (ignorance) of the followers of al-Hajuri and the many calamities of al-Hajuri (including  matters of belief) are being brought out, whether they took place ten years ago, or fifteen, or five, or three or two, even some of those he may have apparently retracted from. So this is from the divine justice that is being meted out, al-Hajuri ate the flesh of righteous Scholars known historically for defending Sunnah and <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> ("the scholars flesh is poisonous") and <b>al-Hajuri is being outed for the foul-mouthed fool that he is, and the liar that he is</b>, so we see now examples of his foul street language used to address the Scholars, we see many of his mistakes in aqeedah and usool, we see the many of the fools surrounding him being exposed for their <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> in <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>, we see calamities of al-Hajuri in relation to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), in relation to the Sahaabah (radiallahu anhu) and calamities towards the Imaams of the Salaf (rahimahumullaah).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>And there is an irony here, which is that whilst the flesh of the scholars is worthless in the eyes of al-Hajuri and his cult-followers, the flesh of al-Hajuri is as if it is divine, if melted it morphs into the uncreated attribute of Allaah's speech (<a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>see previous article</a>).</b> </div>    <P>
So al-Hajuri's recompense is exposition of his deviation, his misguidance and his splitting of the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. This is a matter that is outside of anyone's hands, it is the divine justice, and al-Hajuri and his followers are too dumb to realize it. We see the dim-witted <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> in all places coming out in the blogs and forums and through email lists whining and moaning, "But al-Hajuri retracted from that and clarified that...", "You people are oppressors and unjust...", "These are old issues that have passed..." and so on. Indeed they are a foolish people, it would be hard to find one amongst them with something of aql (reason and intellect), because at this stage in this particular fitnah, you have to absent of any aql (reason) to remain with al-Hajuri. Al-Hajuri and his followers are tasting the results of their own hands, but they just can't see it.     <P>
Our message to the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a> is that you make tawbah to Allaah, you leave wallowing and delving into baatil (falsehood), and that you return to the Scholars and to their advices, directions, rulings as it relates to al-Hajuri and his likes. The <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> do not have the aql (reason) to see the realities for what they are, they are just whining and moaning for what their hands have wrought and brought upon themselves. As for whatever tawbah they claim has been made (whether by al-Hajuri or his cult-followers), that is between them and Allaah, no one comes in between Allaah and his servant when he repents <b>with a correct shar'iyy tawbah, meeting all the conditions</b>, however, whilst it is alleged that al-Hajuri has recanted, whether these recantations are correct shar'iyy repentances is something that needs to be looked into, because what is becoming apparent in many of the issues for which he has been rightly criticized, he is taking the way of al-Ma'ribee of playing and fooling around in speech when tawbah was necessitated for him and <a href=index255e.html?mgwkm>lying outright</a> [as al-Hajuri did in the issue of accusing the Companions of participating in the murder of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu)], and in numerous other issues he has not and is not showing any repentance and examples of this will be presented in due course inshaa'Allaah.  </blockquote> <P>
