<p><div class='sidebar'><a href=assets/docs/abdul-haqq-baker-cultism-2.pdf><img src=assets/images/pdf-icon.jpg align="left" style="padding:0px 5px 0px 0px;" border=0></a><b>Sayyid Qu&#7789;b</b> (and Mawd&#363;d&#299;) revived the manhaj of the Kh&#257;rijites and his books and teachings led to the appearance of <b>al-Qaeda and ISIS</b>. In the mid-1990s Salafi Publications was involved in an intense battle against those spreading these doctrines in the West by translating and conveying the <a href='tags/refutations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>refutations</font></a> of the scholars against Sayyid Qu&#7789;b, his writings, his followers and his defenders. The Qu&#7789;bists in the West, foremost among them was <b>Al&#299; Tim&#299;m&#299;</b>, they regurgitated the lies and slanders of deviant Qu&#7789;bists and Tur&#257;thists in the Arab lands, such as <b>&#703;Abd al-Razz&#257;q al-Shayij&#299;</b>, and applied them to the Salafis in the West. Hence, their labels '<b>Salafiyyah Jad&#299;dah</b>' (Neo-Salafism), '<b>Destructive Cult</b>', '<b>Muqallidah</b>' and so on.  <a href=assets/docs/abdul-haqq-baker-cultism-2.pdf>Download PDF File</a></div>    <P>

<u>Response:</u>     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Firstly, and most importantly, don't you think your first question should be to Abd al-Haqq Baker: Which scholar preceded you in calling Maktabah <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> a "cult"? What blinded you from this obvious question?    <P>
Second, sit down. Then, read the article, slowly, with focus and with care and you will find that it is explaining how Abd al-Haqq is slandering Salafis with the slander of the Qutbists from the 1990s. It states nowhere that Abd al-Haqq is a Qutbist. Also note how it did not anger you that Abd al-Haqq referred to Salafis as a "cult" and what this implies of following pseudo-religion and erecting and worshipping figures. So this mighty slander did not shock and anger you, but it angered you that Abd al-Haqq's slander was traced to its origins.     <P>
Also follow the line of argument in the article from beginning to end. This whole issue starts with the manhaj of Qutb and al-Banna and those who wore the gown of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, such as <a href='tags/al-maribi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ma'ribi</font></a>, and invented principles to shield these misguided deviants and their methodologies. They then tried to push these principles, deceptively, to Salafi audiences. The article explains the various positions that were taken towards these individuals and how that led to splits.     <P>
It explains why Abd al-Haqq, today in 2017 is regurgitating the slanders of the Qutbists of the 1990s. It is because they were put to trial by the fitnah of an Ikhwani, Abu al-Hasan <a href='tags/al-maribi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Ma'ribi</font></a>, and despite the advice of the scholars to them, to remain with Maktabah <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and remain united, they chose their own way. But now, close to two decades later, they wrongly believe that they can sideline these issue and throw around these slanderous accusations by misrepresenting history or omitting details from it. In doing so, they are trying to deceive thousands of people who never experienced these affairs two decades ago, and many of them were perhaps not even born then! </blockquote>     <P>
