<p><div class='sidebar'><a href=assets/docs/athar-salaf-evidence.pdf><img src=assets/images/pdf-icon.jpg align="left" style="padding:0px 5px 0px 0px;" border=0></a>When we say: Abu Bakr said, Umar said, Ibn &#703;Abb&#257;s said, Ibn Mas&#703;&#363;d said (radiyall&#257;hu &#703;anhum), Ab&#363; al-&#703;&#256;liyah said, Ibn S&#299;r&#299;n said, al-Zuhr&#299; said, al-Awz&#257;&#703;&#299; said, M&#257;lik said, A&#7717;mad said (rahimahumull&#257;h) and so on... we are conveying dal&#299;l (evidence) for the correct understanding of the &#703;aq&#257;&#702;id and man&#257;hij of Isl&#257;m from the primary texts of the Qur&#702;&#257;n and the Sunnah. And this is what differentiates us from all the <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> and deviants.     <P>
It distinguishes us from Ikhw&#257;n&#299;s like Shadeed Mu&#7717;ammad and those who support him and his Ikhw&#257;n&#299; methodology of belittlement of the effect of Taw&#7717;&#299;d in rectifying societies and calling for <a href='tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a> and activism around sociopolitical issues and his grievance about white men of Taw&#7717;&#299;d and Sunnah refuting the shirk and kufr of black men from the Nation of Qarma&#7789;&#299; B&#257;&#7789;iniyyah. This includes the two ignoramuses pictured above who undermine the fahm of the Salaf through the deceptive (grammatically incorrect) slogan 'The &#256;th&#257;r of the Salaf arenýt dal&#299;l in and of itself.' <b><a href=assets/docs/athar-salaf-evidence.pdf>Click to Download PDF File</a></b>.   </div>    <P>
