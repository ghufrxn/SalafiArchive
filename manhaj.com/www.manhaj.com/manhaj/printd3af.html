<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Another of the many examples of the <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> (extremism) of the students of al-Hajuri al-Haddadi towards him is the following (and these are widespread and established and the recordings are present):    <P>

<b>Translation:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>O Yahya, had Imaam al-Shafi'ee met with you, he would have commenced the celebratory reception (for you). And had Yahyaa bin Qattaan seen you, he would have put you forward and we would have ended the dispute. And had al-Khateeb (al-Baghdadi) met him (al-Hajuri), he would have no doubt that you are a vast receptacle (of knowledge). And had Bishr (al-Haafee) seen you, he would have approached you with asceticism (towards you). And the ordeal of (Imaam Ahmad), in reality, would become insignificant (in comparison with yours). And if Allaah was to revive the men of knowledge, they would have said "You O Yahya are the (illuminating) light."</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Notes:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Yes, of course, Yahya the Superstar, he has reached the constellations in his greatness, and just who is <u>Imaam al-Shafi'ee</u> compared to Yahya al-Haddadi? Al-Shafi'ee would have been the one to initiate the celebratory reception upon meeting al-Hajuri (recognizing the obvious greatness of al-Hajuri). <u>Yahya al-Qattaan</u> would have acknowledged his inferiority in the presence of al-Hajuri. And <u>al-Khateeb</u> would have had to concede that al-Hajuri is the cradle of knowledge. <u>Bishr al-Haafee</u> would have been forced into abject humility in front of al-Hajuri. And O <u>Ahmad</u>, so what of your trials! Just ponder over those of Yahya and your's will become insignificant! And if Allaah revived 14 centuries worth of the men of knowledge they would have collectively chanted, "<i>You O Yahya are the illuminating light!</i>"</blockquote> <P>
