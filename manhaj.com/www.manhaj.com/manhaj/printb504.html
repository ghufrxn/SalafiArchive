<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. These examples were compiled by Abdullah bin Qasim al-Madkhali.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Ghamdaan al-Dhimaaree stated:    <P>
<blockquote><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1610;&#1575; &#1588;&#1610;&#1582;&#1606;&#1575; &#1610;&#1585;&#1593;&#1575;&#1603; &#1585;&#1576;&#1610; &#1573;&#1606;&#1606;&#1610; &#1604;&#1575; &#1571;&#1576;&#1578;&#1594;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1606;&#1610;&#1575; &#1608;&#1571;&#1606;&#1578; &#1585;&#1581;&#1610;&#1604;   &#1571;&#1602;&#1587;&#1605;&#1578; &#1571;&#1606;&#1610; &#1604;&#1608; &#1605;&#1587;&#1581;&#1578; &#1581;&#1584;&#1575;&#1569;&#1607; &#1591;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1610;&#1575;&#1577; &#1604;&#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1584;&#1575;&#1603; &#1602;&#1604;&#1610;&#1604;</span>    <P>
Our Shaykh! May Allaah watch over you. Verily, I will (have no desire) to pursue the world whilst you have departed. I swear that if I washed (polished) his (al-Hajuri's) shoe for a lifetime, it would amount to (very) little.  </blockquote>    <P>
After this qaseedah (poetry) finished, Yahya al-Haddaadi said:    <P>
<blockquote><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1580;&#1586;&#1575;&#1603; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1582;&#1610;&#1585;&#1575; &#1608;&#1606;&#1601;&#1593;   &#1576;&#1603; &#1571;&#1587;&#1571;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1604;&#1606;&#1575; &#1608;&#1604;&#1603;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1608;&#1601;&#1610;&#1602;</span>    <P>
May Allaah reward you with good and bring benefit through you, I ask Allaah for success for me and for you.  </blockquote>    <P>
We don't know what type of tarbiyah (nurturing and education) that an alleged "<i>Imaam of the Men and Jinn</i>" and "<i>Star amongst Stars</i>" can give to his followers such that they would consider it <b>insignificant</b> to be shining and polishing his shoes for a lifetime. As an educated guess it is likely because al-Hajuri has cocooned the students, keeping them away from the rest of the people of knowledge and teaching them that knowledge only is in one place (the seat of al-Hajuri) and that any opposition to al-Hajuri and his views and opinions will put them on the receiving end of the boot. Deliberately being kept sheltered like this, the less intelligent amongst those students begin to think as if Yahya al-Haddadi has gathered all the knowledge of the scholars of the Ummah and that knowledge is in <a href='tags/dammaaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dammaaj</font></a> only and nowhere else. And a subset of those less intelligent ones end up making remarks like the one above about shining shoes. Meanwhile Yahya al-Haddaadi listens and thanks the likes of these people...    <P>
Compare this to the humility of the likes of Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen, Shaykh Rabee' and others and you soon come to realize that what we have going on here is simply one fool praising a second fool who is gleeful and happy at receiving the praise of the first fool and thanking and supplicating for him for it. <P>
