<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah known as the <b>Hawaajirah</b> who have emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah with a type of harshness and enmity against Ahl al-Sunnah that has no precedent. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. When it is the case that the Messenger of Allaah, (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Companions (radiallaahu anhu) are not free from the tongue of <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, then it is unlikely that his followers will have any shame in attacking those less than them, the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
Al-Hajuri has displayed many deviations in matters of belief, and has shown his instability and lack of firmness in matters of belief, espousing a false doctrine, then recanting, espousing another, then recanting, espousing another then recanting, and espousing many others and not recanting... this type of individual is not to be studied with. The following audio is a question put to Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> in which some of the errors of al-Hajuri are presented. As the years have passed by, more and more deviations of al-Hajuri have become apparent... and the Shaykh's answer has become even more apt in the present time.  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzan</font></a> Warns From Studying with the Likes of al-Hajuri Who Have No Firm Grounding in Knowledge</font>    <P>
Listen to the audio here:    <P>

Translation:    <P>
<blockquote><b>Question: This questioner says: A teachers says the following statements to his students: a) Verily Allaah made istiwaa over his Throne without touching (a saying of Ahl al-Kalaam) then he recanted, b) The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) erred in the story of frowning and turning away (in Surah al-Abasa), then he recanted, c) He ascribed to Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah) the saying of tasalsul, then he recanted, and likewise, there are numerous other mistakes. So is the likes of this one studied with?</b></blockquote>    <P>

<blockquote>This is one who causes doubts, he makes the people doubt about the affairs of their aqidah. It is not permissible to study with him, nor to take knowledge from him because (the likes of) this one is from the people of misguidance. He causes the people to doubt, proclaims his false aqidah and then when he sees that the people have shown rejection against him, he proclaims recantation, out of deception. So it is not permissible to accept (accommodate) this person and nor to study under him, rather it is obligatory to warn against him.</blockquote> <P>
