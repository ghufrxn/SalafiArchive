<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>In this series of articles we present the statements of the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah which clarify and explain the issue of (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1584;&#1585; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1607;&#1604;</span>), the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a>, and also (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1593;&#1604;&#1608;&#1605; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1590;&#1585;&#1608;&#1585;&#1577;</span>), that which is known from the religion by necessity. There is much confusion and speculation about this issue, despite the fact that it is very clear in the speech of the Scholars. One should also be aware of factions of the <b>Takfiris, Qutbis</b> who allege that the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah such as Imaam Ibn Baz, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, Imaam al-Albaani, Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad and many other contemporary Scholars are "revisionists," a charge levelled because these Scholars did not agree to their methodologies and positions (of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of nations and societies or <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of certain rulers). Hence, they extended this claim of revisionism beyond the issue of the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of the rulers into other issues (such as the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> and that which is known from the religion by necessity) in order to discredit these Scholars and make the people not take from them and instead to drive the people towards the Harakiyyeen and their figureheads. These Qutbis and Takfiris are ignorant people, they are pretenders to knowledge, and they employ much deception. Instead of being honest and saying that difference in this issue can be found right through the history of the da'wah of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in Najd, and varying sayings can be found amongst the Scholars of the da'wah, they opted for their usual trait of deception and lies and tried to attack those Scholars who spoke against their Qutbi da'wah by accusing them of being "revisionists" merely because they held the view of granting the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> in matters of kufr and shirk within certain circumstances. Addressing their falsehood and their conniving in detail is for another place. Here we want to systematically document the sayings of the scholars for the purposes of building a record and at a later time, we will inshaa'Allaah, discuss some of these issues with the purpose of clarification.</blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzan</font></a> on the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> and Barriers to <a href="tags/takfir.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">takfir</font></a></font>    <P>
This <a href=assets/audio/fawzan-excuse-ignorance.mp3>brief audio</a> brief audio comprises a question put to Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> regarding a person invoking others besides Allaah for that which only Allaah has power and control over.    <P>
Shaykh Abd al-Azeez al-Rahijee presents the question:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The questioner says, "Whoever performs shirk, such as (a person) calling upon other than Allaah for example, for a cure to an illness (or ill person), so do we say "<i>He is a mushrik</i>" or do we say, "<i>His action is shirk</i>" (with the knowledge) that he says "<i>Laa ilaaha ilallaah</i>" and he fast and makes pilgrimage.</blockquote>     <P>
Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> answers:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>When he does not have an excuse in falling into Shirk then he is a mushrik.  As for when he is ignorant, or a muqallid (blind-follower of others), or he makes an interpretation he considers to be correct, then the (affair) is explained to him, then if he disobeys, then the judgement of shirk is made upon him, because his ignorance has now ceased.</blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh affirms that a person may have an excuse, when he is ignorant or blindly following others thinking he is guided, or makes a faulty interpretation (ta'weel) he deems to be correct. So here the Shaykh said this one is to be advised and corrected. This statement should be read with many other statements of the Shaykh and other Mashaayikh which collectively inform us that what is considered (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1593;&#1604;&#1608;&#1605; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1590;&#1585;&#1608;&#1585;&#1577;</span>) "<i>that which is known from the religion by necessity</i>" is not a fixed affair, rather it changes from place to place and time to time, and it cannot be used absolutely to reject the other principle of (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1584;&#1585; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1607;&#1604;</span>) "<i>the excuse of ignorance</i>" which is amongst the barriers to <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a>.  <P>
