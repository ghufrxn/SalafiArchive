In this series - out of pure mercy and compassion for the cult-followers of al-Hajuri who have had their minds hijacked - we will expose some of these crimes. We just hope that the light shined upon these crimes is not rendered insignificant by the <a href=index5d28.html?zzpwe>intense shining light</a> of Yahya al-Haddadi, thereby defeating our purpose! </blockquote>  </div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Yahya  al-Haddadi Clipping the Statements of the Imaams of the Salaf To Justify His Revilement Upon Uthmaan bin Affaan (radiallaahu anhu)</font>    <P>
Yahya al-Haddadi has numerous revilements upon the Companions (radiallaahu anhum) - even the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) has not been spared from his vile and obnoxious tongue - and an instance of that is ascribing bid'ah to Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) and declaring the action of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) in adding a second aadhaan for Jumu'ah as being the "mother" for all subsequent innovations.     <P>
In the process of trying to justify  this position, Yahya al-Haddadi clips the words of the Scholars, and an example of that is what he has done with a quote from Ishaaq bin Raahuyah, as cited by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali in his explanation of Sahih al-Bukhari. Photo scans were posted online by Dr. Arafat al-Muhammadee, may Allaah reward him. Here is the book published online on his website, with the relevant citation (click to open):    <P>
<a href=assets/images/hajuri-jumuah-adhan-rahuyah.jpg><img src=assets/images/hajuri-jumuah-adhan-rahuyah.jpg width=525 border=1 border=0></a>    <P>
Returning back to Fath al-Bari of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali one finds the completion of the saying of Ishaq bin Rahuyah:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/hajuri-jumuah-adhan-rahuyah-rajab.jpg width=525 border=1 border=0>    <P>
The citation of Yahya al-Haddaadi is as follows:    <P>
<blockquote class='quotered'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>He (Ishaq) said: The first adhaan of the day of Jumu'ah is <u>innovated</u>, it is was <u>innovated</u> by Uthmaan, this athar was mentioned by Ibn Rajab in Fath al-Bari (8/220-221).</blockquote>    <P>
The full citation is as follows:     <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>The first adhaan for Jumu'ah is <u>introduced</u>, it was <u>introduced</u> by Uthmaan. He saw that (the adhaan) will not be heard unless he increases the mu'adhdhins so that those furthest away will be informed (of time of Jumu'ah) and hence it became a Sunnah, because it is upon the Khulafaa to look into such  matters for the (benefit of) the people.</blockquote>    <P>
Now a few important notes here:    <P>
<blockquote><b>ONE:</b> Why have we translated Yahya al-Haddadi's citation with the word "innovated" and yet translated the actual citation with the word "introduced?" We have done so on the intent of each person. The intent of Yahya al-Haddadi is to ascribe actual "bid'ah" to Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) in the blameworthy sense, with the bid'ah condemned in the Shari'ah - so here we translated "muhdath" and "ahdatha" upon the intent of Yahya al-Haddaadi. The intent of Ishaq bin Rahuyah is to show that the Khulafaa are obliged to investigate and look into such matters for the benefit of the people and in this case, the affair that was <u>introduced</u> (i.e. with the <i>linguistic</i> meaning) became a Sunnah - this is upon the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "<i>Upon you is my Sunnah and the Sunnah of my rightly-guided Khulafaa</i>..." and in reality, in these types of matters, the Sunnahs of the Khulafaa is an extension of the Sunnah of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). Hence, in order for justice to be done to the speech of each person, it has been translated upon the mashrab (orientation) of each person. This is what justice demands.    <P>
<b>TWO:</b> In light of the first point then, Yahya al-Haddadi has two crimes, the crime of clipping the citation made by Ibn Rajab of the speech of Ishaq bin Rahuyah - this is academic dishonesty -  and secondly the crime of ascribing to Ibn Rajab and Ishaq bin Rahuyah his own evil suspicion against Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu).    <P>
<b>THREE:</b> This crime is not an isolated crime, we see that Yahyaa al-Haddaadi has taken the same approach and tact in some of his other criminal activities, such as the issue of accusing the Companions of participating in the murder of Uthmaan (radiallaahu anhu) where he tried to pass the buck to Scholars such as Ibn Katheer (see <a href=indexac4b.html?cftvz>here</a>, <a href=index31af.html?taggg>here</a>, <a href=index255e.html?mgwkm>here</a> and <a href=index942a.html?bhbgz>here</a>) and also on the issue of accusing the Companions of originating the bid'ah of al-Irjaa which he tried to pass on to Ibn Taymiyyah (to come in another article inshaa'Allaah).     <P>
