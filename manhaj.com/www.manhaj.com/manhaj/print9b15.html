<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
In a piece of poetry titled (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1586;&#1580;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1593;&#1580;&#1576;&#1610;&#1606; &#1576;&#1571;&#1606;&#1601;&#1587;&#1607;&#1605;</span>), "Rebuking Those Amazed with Themselves..." (how ironic!), the author says:    <P>
<blockquote><div align=center><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1583;&#1605;&#1575;&#1580;&#1615; &#1605;&#1593;&#1602;&#1616;&#1604;&#1615; &#1583;&#1610;&#1606;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#1616; &#1573;&#1606; &#1582;&#1615;&#1584;&#1604;&#1614;&#1578; *** &#1601;&#1573;&#1606; &#1583;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1607;&#1583;&#1609; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1585;&#1590;&#1616; &#1602;&#1583; &#1582;&#1615;&#1584;&#1604;&#1575;</span></div></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Translation:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>Dammaj is the fortress (sanctuary) of the deen of Allaah. If it is abandoned, the deen of guidance upon the (entire) earth has been abandoned.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Notes:</b>    <P>
<blockquote>We have seen plenty of examples of <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> in <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> - in the face of whom 14 centuries of the men of knowledge would not amount to much, and whose melted flesh would become the uncreated speech of Allaah (<a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>see here</a>) - and numerous other types of madness which we do not want to repeat here (you can refer to previous articles in this series).    <P>
However, part of this <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> is also with respect to Dammaj, and there are abundant examples of this too. The sensible person need only an illustration or two to start seeing the overall pattern, which appears to be: <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> is the Imaam of this Earth, nay, he is higher than <a href=indexac51.html?gxpqv>the constellation of Gemini</a> in his apparent majesty, he has gathered the traits of the earlier and the later ones who if brought in front of al-Hajuri would have all <a href=indexd3af.html?rkwbk>exlaimed in unison</a>, "<i>You O Yahya are the illuminating light</i>" and in turn Dammaj is the sanctuary of Islam, Islam has but receded to Dammaj. And if Dammaj is somehow deserted or abandoned, "<i>the deen of Allaah on the earth</i>" - which implies  the deen of Allaah <u>entirely and as a whole</u> - has been deserted(!)    <P>
This is clearly the tarbiyah (nurturing, cultivation) that has been taking place for many years and the signs and effects of it have been witnessed and experienced in a very clear fashion. What we have here is really just the tip of the iceberg. When these criticisms, upon evidence and the actual realities, are made clear al-Hajuri and the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> resound with their slogan, "<i>Taqleed!</i>" - a pauper's response, a cheap response - indicating that they are not able to address these criticisms that have been made against the excessive <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> coming from some of them and their following the ways of the Sufis.    <P>
    <P>
  </blockquote> <P>
