<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. </blockquote></div>    <P>
<blockquote>  Abd al-Kareem al-Ja'mee - one of the fanatics of al-Hajuri - said in his piece of poetry titled "O Travellers to Dammaaj":    <P>
<div align=center><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1605;&#1575;&#1569; &#1610;&#1586;&#1610;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1585;&#1615; &#1592;&#1604;&#1605;&#1578;&#1614;&#1607;&#1575; = &#1601;&#1573;&#1606; &#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1609; &#1610;&#1614;&#1586;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1614;&#1608;&#1614;&#1617; &#1604;&#1604;&#1581;&#1616;&#1604;&#1602;&#1616;    <P>
&#1592;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618;&#1578;&#1615;&#1607;&#1615; &#1573;&#1606; &#1571;&#1606;&#1575; &#1588;&#1576;&#1607;&#1578;&#1607; &#1602;&#1605;&#1585;&#1611;&#1575; = &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1610;&#1594;&#1608;&#1585; &#1608;&#1602;&#1583;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1582; &#1601;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1602;&#1616;    <P>
&#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1583;&#1585; &#1578;&#1576;&#1607;&#1578;&#1607; &#1588;&#1605;&#1587; &#1608;&#1610;&#1581;&#1580;&#1576;&#1607; = &#1589;&#1608;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1594;&#1605;&#1575;&#1605; &#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1605;&#1575; &#1607;&#1604; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1614;&#1583;&#1614;&#1602;&#1616;</span></div>    <P>
  <blockquote>Whereas the full moon beautifies the sky's darkness, then Yahya beautifies the atmosphere for [gatherings of people]. I would have wronged him if I resembled him to the moon. For [the moon's brightness] seeps away whereas the loftiness of the Shaykh is in shining (glistening) brilliance. [Further], the sun makes the full moon to fade and the clouds conceal it when it appears not (in the presence of) rain.</blockquote>    <P>
There are a number of things here:    <P>
This poet considers it <a href='tags/oppression.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>oppression</font></a> for the light of Yahya al-Haddadi to be compared to the light of the moon and he explains the reasons for that, which are:    <P>
<ul><li>   That the light of the moon is temporary and fades away whereas the light of Yahya al-Haddadi does not.     <P>
<li> That the light of the moon is faded away by the light of the sun, unlike the light of Yahya al-Haddadi, for there is no light that overcomes the light of Yahya al-Haddadi.    <P>
<li> That the light of the moon is concealed by what is beneath it such as the clouds, unlike the light of Yahya al-Haddaadi which is not concealed by anything at all. </ul>    <P>
The bottom line here then is that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> is spoken of by the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> as if he is like the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam). In al-Bukhari and Muslim, there occurs in the hadeeth of Abdullah bin Ka'b, (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1608;&#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1589;&#1604;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605; &#1573;&#1584;&#1575; &#1587;&#1615;&#1585;&#1614;&#1617; &#1575;&#1587;&#1578;&#1606;&#1575;&#1585; &#1608;&#1580;&#1607;&#1607; &#1581;&#1578;&#1609; &#1603;&#1571;&#1606;&#1607; &#1602;&#1591;&#1593;&#1577; &#1602;&#1605;&#1585; &#1608;&#1603;&#1606;&#1575; &#1606;&#1593;&#1585;&#1601; &#1584;&#1604;&#1603; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607;</span>), "<i>And when the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) was happy, his face would become illuminated as if it was a portion of the moon, and we used to know that from him</i>" and there are ahaadeeth similar to this, however the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> <a href='tags/ghulaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat</font></a> were not satisfied with this until they had to exaggerate further and say that even the brightness of the sun would not cause the the light of Yahyaa al-Haddaadi to fade!    <P>
