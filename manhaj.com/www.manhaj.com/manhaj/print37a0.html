<div class='sidebar'><img src=assets/images/shadeed-demo-courage.png width="250" align="right" border=0> <font style='font-size:19px;'>Introduction and Background</font>     <P>
All of the Salafi scholars in the contemporary era strongly prohibit against <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> and they include <b>Shaykh al-Albaani, Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymin, Shaykh Muqbil, Shaykh al-Ghudayaan, Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhali, Shaykh Ahmad al-Najmi, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a>, Shaykh Rabee, Shaykh Ubayd</b> and others. These are ways that the Ikhwaan imported from the non-Muslims as a means of either rebelling against rulers or calling for justice by putting pressure on the authorities. These scholars reject the distinction between peaceful and violent <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> and they reject <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> even when the ruler or government allows them.     <P>
They are opposed by the misguided Ikhwanis who oppose the methodology of the Prophets in rectifying the servant and the land, who belittle the affairs of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and who focus on social and political affairs, making them the foundation, and do not see a great or primary role, for <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in rectifying societies. As such, they mobilise the masses around social and political affairs without distinction between a Sunni and Bid'iyy.     <P>
There are found in the West Ikhwanis such as <b><a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a></b> who ascribe to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, using it as a gown, whilst blatantly opposing the guidance of the Salaf and the Salafi scholars of our times. At the same time, they plagiarise the writings or use the arguments of the disparaged  such as <b><a href='tags/haatim-al-awni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haatim al-Awni</font></a></b> whose views (and similar views of others) have been refuted by the likes of Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> for attacking the da'wah of Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhaab, and also by others for numerous other issues that relate to affairs of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and worship. Listen to this audio in which a view expressed by some including al-Awni regarding al-Durar al-Saniyyah is mentioned to Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> and the Shaykh's response (<a href=assets/audio/fawzan-haatim-awni-durar-saniyyah-new.mp3>mp3 audio</a>).    <P>
Shadeed Mu&#7717;ammad wrote a document titled, "Courage is Grace Under Fire", a statement (with a minor difference) ascribed to <b>Ernest Hemingway</b> (d. 1961), an American novelist, and <b>Winston Churchill</b> (d. 1965), who was Prime Minister of Great Britain during WWII. It is also a military phrase, used for war situations. The statement defines courage as calmness and collectedness in difficult, stressful situations. Shadeed added a subtitle to this document, "An Islamic Perspective on <a href='tags/protests.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>protests</font></a> and Peaceful Demonstrations". The very first quote in his document is: "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable", from <b>John F. Kennedy</b> (d. 1963), President of the United States. The final quote in his document is: "To live greatly we must develop the capacity to face difficulty with courage, disappointment with grace and triumph with humility", from <b>Thomas S. Monson</b> (d. 2013), a Christian leader and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    <P>
<b>Shadeed makes the statements of these non-Muslims the asl (foundation) of his article, since they comprise <u>the title</u>, <u>first quote</u> and <u>last quote</u> of his article. Then in between he twists the religion to support the statements of these non-Muslim novelists, politicians and Christian leaders, distorting the Book of Allaah, distorting the Sunnah and lying upon the Companions (the Salaf) in the process. Thus, he made the ways and methods of the disbelievers and their statements to be a foundation for which the religion of Islam, the speech of Allaah, the speech of the Messenger, the action of the Companions, is used to validate and support.</b>    <P>
<b>View article:</b> <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-1.png>Page 1</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-2.png>Page 2</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-3.png>Page 3</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-4.png>Page 4</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-5.png>Page 5</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-6.png>Page 6</a>, <a href=assets/images/shadeed-demo-article-7.png>Page 7</a>.    <P>
In this 7 page article <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> wrote (pictured), he pretty much reproduced the article of <a href='tags/haatim-al-awni.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haatim al-Awni</font></a> and the arguments it contains in which he argues for the legality of <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a>. This is evidence that <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> is upon the path of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> and all those after him who neglect the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers and adopt the ways and means of the disbelievers in rectifying social and political injustice.     <P>
In this series of articles we will expose, inshaa'Allaah, the jahl and hawaaa of the Ikhwaani <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> in this subject and particularly his slander against some of the Companions and against Aa'ishah (radiyallaahu anhaa) and his lies against Allaah (azzawajall) and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasaallam) and his call for Muslim governments to legislate with the legislation of democracy by legalising <a href='tags/protests.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>protests</font></a> and <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a>.     <P>
Previously, <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> has been spoken against by the Salafi scholars on account of other clearly misguided statements and Shaykh <a href='tags/ubayd-al-jaabiree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ubayd al-Jaabiree</font></a> called him <b>"Daall, mudill", a misguided strayer who misguides others</b>, (<a href=assets/audio/shk-ubayd-shadeed-daall-mudill.mp3>mp3 audio</a>).    <P>
The reader should note that it is the way of Salafis to support and aid the madhhab of the Salaf and the methodology of the Prophets and to support the views, positions and fatwas of the Salafi scholars in issues connecting to methodology such as this one. In contrast it is the way of the people of lies and slander, the people of false ascription to <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, to attack such Salafis and to defame them and belittle them. All so that they can defend and shield misguided people (like Shadeed Muhammad) from being refuted for views they hold that are in clear opposition to the Salafi methodology and to the views of the Salafi scholars. This reveals their dishonesty and the true basis of their loyalty, which is not around the truth.    <P>
<b>Note:</b> <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> and <a href='tags/tahir-wyatt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tahir Wyatt</font></a> are veterans of the failed Madeenah dot con network that tried to undermine and destroy Salafi Publications over ten years ago. However, their plots failed and those behind this network were declared liars and mischief makers by Shaykh Ubayd and Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee (see <a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=9&amp;Topic=12297>here</a>,  <a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=6&amp;Topic=8601>here</a>, <a href=assets/images/shk-muhammad-madeenah-dot-con-spubs.png>here</a> and <a href=assets/images/shk-ubayd-madeenah-dot-con-spubs.png>here</a>). This is why they are filled with great resentment and hatred and why all of them, <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a>, Munir Muhammad, <a href='tags/tahir-wyatt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tahir Wyatt</font></a>, have speech with respect to these scholars, including Shaykh Rabee, that is the very same speech as the <a href='tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a>, Surooriyyah and Turaathiyyah of the 1990s and the Ma'ribiyyah of the 2000's. They claimed that Shaykh Rabee is being worshipped or that the religion or scholarship is being restricted only to him and a few others and so on and that he has caused trials and split Salafis and so on. The Shadeed's and Munir's of the 2010s resemble in some respects the &#1616;<b>Abd al-Razzaaq Shayijee's</b> of the 1990s, and alhamdulillaah 20 years ago, we translated <a href='tags/refutations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>refutations</font></a> against al-Shayijee and disseminated them on the Salafi Publications website. And this is the real grievance of these people. The Salafi methodology comes in the way of their Ikhwani methodology of gathering people and not distinguishing between Sunnah and its people and bid'ah and its people and rallying people around social and political affairs upon the way of the Ikhwanis. <b>They are proceeding upon the ways of <a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> and Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq of "collective work" (al-`amal al-jamaa`ee) with its innovated Ikhwani understanding</b>. These individuals have not given up till this day and their efforts continue.  </div> <P> 


<p><font style='font-size:19px;'>Summary of the Articles of Haatim al-Awnee / <a href="tags/shadeed-muhammad.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Shadeed Muhammad</font></a></font>     <P>
In the screenshot of the article below  Haatim al-Awnee says the following:    <P>
<ol><li>He distinguishes between peaceful <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> and armed or violent revolt.    <P>
<li>Claims peaceful <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> are a means of expressing opinion and effecting change and putting pressure on the government.    <P>
<li>Claims that ruling on <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> is that of the ways and means (wasaa'il) and ways and means take rulings of the goals and  ends (ghaayaat).    <P>
<li>That since the ways and means are from the masaalih mursalah (matters of broad public interest),  then they are not dependent on a specific  text, but upon  the generality of the texts and the objectives (maqaasid) of the Shari'ah point to them.    <P>
<li>He claims that Aa'ishah, al-Zubayr and Talhah (radiyallaahu anhum) engaged in a "Salafi" demonstration when they came out after Uthmaan (radiyallaahu anhu) was killed and that Ali (radiyallaahu anhu) did not show any rejection against their action of protesting against him.    <P>
<li>That the  fact that harm (killing) resulted from their action [in the Battle of the Jamal] cannot be used to deny the foundation of their action (of  the alleged demonstration) because the fighting was not intended.    <P>
<li>That consideration of benefits and their harms varies from situation to situation and place to place and from one demonstration to another. And that the country which allows <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> is not like the one that does not allow demonstration.     <P>
<li>That every Muslim government should legislate laws allowing pressure to  be put on the government by its people through <a href='tags/protests.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>protests</font></a> so that their freedoms and liberties are not curtailed.    <P>
<li>That nations and states survive only on account of the justice that they abide by and justice is what  makes nations last.    <P>
<li>That legislation which gives the subjects the right the correct the authority (in the said manner) is an Islamic legislation and rightly-guided methodology that was laid down by Abu Bakr who said to the Companions, "If I err (do wrong) then correct me".    <P>
<li>That in summary, <a href='tags/demonstrations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>demonstrations</font></a> are permissible, they are not unlawful (haram), unless greater harm arises compared to their benefit, and in some cases they can be obligatory.  </ol>    <P>
All of the above is reproduced entirely (with some reshuffling) by <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> in his article on this subject.      <P>
