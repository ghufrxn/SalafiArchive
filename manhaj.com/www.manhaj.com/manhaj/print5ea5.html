<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Following the role of Ahl al-Sunnah in the West of conveying the speech of the Scholars regarding certain figureheads who went astray, the followers of many of these figureheads spread doubts about some of the callers in the West, with respect to teaching and giving da'wah, claiming that a person must have a <a href='tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> to teach, or he  must have graduated from an institution and so on. <b>However, the reality of the matter is that those whom they target in this way actually have  connections with the Scholars, they travel to them, and take knowledge from them in aqidah, manhaj and fiqh, even if they have not formally studied in an institution, or graduated or have a specific tazkiyah</b>. The real reason for these doubts is to undermine what the callers do in the West (in addition to calling to the Sunnah) of warning from doubts, innovations and desires and warning from the people who are upon them or promote them. The articles in these series will shed light on this matter and repel the doubts spread. No one article in this series should be read in isolation as it is possible for <u>a person with ulterior motives</u> to utilize some of these fatwas from the scholars to justify isolation and separation away from the main body of Salafis in that land and from their centres and mosques with the claim that everybody has the green light to teach, and so some of them teach in the mosques and centres of the hizbees and others teach in their homes (often secretly) whilst spreading poison that aims to isolate people from the students of knowledge. Rather, all the statements of all the Shaykhs <b>should be put together and understood collectively</b> to get a clearer picture of this whole affair. This is because there are generalizations in some fatwas, clarifications in others, important minor details in others, and contexts in some fatwas not found in others. All of this should be put together to get a full, comprehensive picture. <u>Alongside the clarifications in these articles</u>, it should be still be stressed that seeking knowledge from the Scholars, by travelling to them and sitting in their lessons is of utmost importance and should not be neglected as it is <u>the primary route</u> of seeking knowledge. And for those who are unable to do this, <b>then they should take from the students of knowledge in their lands, those who have connections with the Scholars, have studied with them and take from them.</b> So they should attend their lessons, in the Salafi mosques and centres, and any issues that arise such as requiring a fatwa, or removal of a <i>shubhah</i> or clarification in an issue of knowledge, then those students of knowledge can return these questions to the Scholars on behalf of the people of that land if the answer is not already known.     <P>
Here are links to all articles so far for easy reference:     <P>

<!---The bottom line is that knowledge can be sought from books and cassettes where it is not possible to take it directly from the scholars, though this is a longer and more burdensome route than taking it from the scholars directly. And it is not a condition that a person  must have a <a href='https://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/tags/tazkiyah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> from a scholar prior to teaching or giving da'wah. However, a person must know his limit and capability and not transgress it and not speak about matters he does not know and he must also seek to understand thoroughly that which he conveys so that where explanation is required he is able to explain that knowledge, and further, he must only resort to books of trusted, deeply-rooted scholars. <b>In all cases, the seeking of knowledge from the scholars directly is the quickest,  easiest route as it allows discussion and for clarifications to be made</b>. Whether a person is fit to convey and teach is known by two ways, either a <a href='https://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/tags/tazkiyah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> from a scholar or by it being it well known by the people of his land that he has knowledge, understanding and ability. //--->  </blockquote></div> <P> 


<p>Shaykh Muhammmad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen stated the following (<a href=assets/audio/knowl-tazkiyah-uthaymeen.mp3>Download File</a>), and this answer relates to a land where there are no scholars and students of knowledge undertake the task of teaching the people:    <P>

<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And this (questioner) says: We mentioned yesterday that whoever depends upon books in acquisition of knowledge then he will err more than he will be correct. And thus, likewise today in (many of) the Islamic countries there are not to be found scholars to whom the people can return to in the affairs of their religion. As a result, a group of youth who have not studied except from books have undertaken to direct them and teach them. So what is obligatory upon these youth?    <P>
[Esteemed Shaykh]: It is obligatory upon them to pursue and investigate the truth out of necessity. And the meaning of that is not that a person cannot be a scholar, mujtahid except through mashaayikh (shaykhs). For there are scholars who reached a great amount of knowledge yet they did not study with mashaayikh. However, this (occurs) little.</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Note:</b> The Shaykh makes tafseel (detail) on the issue of books (refer to <a href=index5b8a.html?pdziw>this article</a>), wherein he says (in his <i>Kitaab al-Ilm</i>):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>There is no doubt that knowledge is acquired through seeking it from the Scholars and seeking it from books because the book of the scholar is the scholar himself, for he is speaking to you through his book. So when seeking (knowledge) is not possible from the people of knowledge, then he seeks knowledge from books. However, acquiring knowledge through the route of the scholars is closer to its acquisition than through the route of books because the one who seeks it through books will toil (struggle) more and requires a great deal of striving. And alongside this some affairs might be hidden from him such as Sharee'ah principles and rules that the people of knowledge have laid down. So it is necessary that he has a reference point from the people of knowledge (to return back to) in accordance with ability. As for his saying, <i>"Whosoever's guide is his book then his error(s) will be more than what he is correct in</i>" then this is not correct unrestrictedly and nor corrupt unrestrictedly. As for the person who takes knowledge from any book he sees, then no doubt he will err abundantly. And as for the one who in his learning depends upon the books of men known for trustworthiness, reliability and knowledge then this person's errors will not be many and he will be correct in the majority of what he says.</blockquote>    <P>
