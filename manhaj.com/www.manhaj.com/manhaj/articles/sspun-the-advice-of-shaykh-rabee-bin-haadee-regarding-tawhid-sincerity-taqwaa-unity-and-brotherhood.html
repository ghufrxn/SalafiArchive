<img src=../assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>On the 22nd Jumadah al-Oulaa 1434H, the Noble Shaykh and Imaam, Rabee' bin Haadee, gave a beneficial word to the Salafi brothers who had congregated from the UK (Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, Premier Hajj group), the US, Maldives, Singapore and India. He spoke of Tawheed and sincerity (ikhlaas) as the basis of taqwaa, <a href='../tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a> and <a href='../tags/brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>brotherhood</font></a> and he warned from the way of those who seek to split the ranks of the Salafis using various ways and means. The following is a translation of the kalimah based upon an audio recording which has been transcribed and placed on <a href=http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=136563>Sahab.Net</a>. </div>    <P>
The Shaykh (hafidhahullaah) said:    <P>
<blockquote>How often has Allaah praised the pious and how often has He encouraged taqwaa (piety) and how often has He explained what awaits them with Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, of the mighty reward. Hence, it is (required of us therefore) to have the taqwa of Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted, and to have steadfastness (istiqaamah) upon the true deen of Allaah, [steadfastness] in our beliefs, in our methodologies, in our (acts of) worship and in all the affairs of our [lives]. To show piety (to Allaah), to have steadfastness upon the truth, to remain firm upon it and to keep away from all that angers Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted, and (from whatever) opposes the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) of beliefs, methodologies and manners.    <P>
It is required of us to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, and this comprises [holding fast to] everything that Islaam came with, "<b>And hold fast all of you to the rope of Allaah</b>" (3:103). Do not leave anything that has come in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger except that you should adhere to it and hold fast to it. Do not let any one of you refrain from this adherence (i'tisaam) to the rope of Allaah, the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam).     <P>
It is upon you to have ikhlaas (sincerity) to Allaah, the Lord of the worlds, "<b>And they were not commanded except to worship Allaah, making the deen sincerely and purely for Him alone, being upright</b>..." (98:5), meaning [worship Him alone whilst] turning away from shirk, being upon the millah (religion, way) of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaatu was-salaam), "<b>And they were not commanded except to worship Allaah alone, making the deen purely and sincerely for Him alone, being upright, and to establish the prayer, give the zakah and that is the upright religion</b>" (98:5).    <P>
The true, upright religion is to make the deen purely and sincerely for Allaah alone in every affair from all of the affairs with that which pleases Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, through following His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, being upright (in all of that) upon the way of Muhammad and Ibraaheem (alayhimaa as-salaatu was-salaam) - upon Tawheed, being far, in every way, from shirk with Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted... and he should establish the prayer. The prayer is a great affair, it is the second pillar after the two testimonials, and (likewise) he should give the zakah, the third pillar, and when he establishes these things, he will have [established] Islaam inshaa'Allaah, and that is the upright religion.     <P>
And you must build brotherly union in [all affairs] between yourselves, go hand in hand (with each other to achieve unity), and cooperate upon righteousness and piety and (you must) keep far away from separation all of its causes. The person who comes to the Salafi Da'wah must adopt this methodology, he should keep away from all the ways that kindle differences and separation. There are some people who stir up the causes of separation, they stir up tribulations and thereby tear up the Salafis, rupturing them [into pieces]. This is not from the correct methodology, and nor from the Salafi way, and nor from the methodology of the Sahaabah and Taabi'een. Some people (deliberately) seek out and find ways which split and tear apart. Such people are not to be trusted with respect to the deen of Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted, and they are not truthful in their claim to <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. It is obligatory that the light is focused upon them, and it be said to them, (asking them), "Why are you coming with all of these causes of separation?", "Why are you splitting the Salafis?"    <P>
The one who errs is to be advised with wisdom, kindness and gentleness,, "<i>And never is gentleness (rifq) [placed] in something except that it beautifies it, and never is it removed from something except that it besmirches it. And never is modesty (hayaa) [found] in something except that it beautifies it</i>." You must (adorn yourselves) with the loftiest manners such as patience, gentle forbearance, and truthfulness, may Allaah bless you, and (likewise) firmness upon the truth. [Allaah, the Exalted, said], "<b>Indeed, there is in the Messenger of Allaah an excellent model of conduct for you</b>" (33:21), and Allaah says, "<b>And indeed you are upon a lofty standard of character</b>" (68:4). And he should (attempt) to perfect the noblest of manners, the noble manners comprise a mighty affair, may Allaah bless you, I advise you with the noble manners.     <P>
So (you should) place all of these affairs in front of your eyes, the taqwa of Allaah, sincerity (ikhlaas), benevolence to the servants of Allaah, and building brotherly union between yourselves and keeping far away from all the causes of separation, and (showing) patience, gentle forbearance, mutual advice with wisdom and good admonition, "<b>Call to the ways of your Lord with wisdom and good admonition</b>..." (6:125), do not (advise and correct) with animosity, harshness, revilement and making examples (of people), no, these (ways) are not from the guidance of the Salaf.    <P>
[Further], you must show mutual love for each other for the sake of Allaah, and mutual affection and visit each other, (in the hadeeth), "<i>My love becomes incumbent for those who love each other for My sake, and those who gather together for my sake, and those who visit each other for my sake</i>..." may Allaah bless you, "... <i>and those who spend upon each other for my sake</i>." These are mighty affairs which are necessary, it is necessary to establish them amongst the (ranks of the) Salafis. Many of the people are negligent of these things, yet they are requisite and necessary. "<i>By Him in whose hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other</i>..." and you will not believe until you love each other, understand this, "...<i>shall I not direct you to something which if you do will cause you to love each other? Spread the salutation (saying <span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1603;&#1605;</span>) between yourselves</i>." Spread the salutation with the intent of actualizing this eemaan which leads to entering Paradise. Do not give salutations simply as a habit, give salutations to you brother out of seeking nearness to Allaah and worship (of Him), and your goal behind this is (causing) togetherness, brotherly union and love.  "<i>By Him in whose hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other</i>..." understand this, mutual love is necessary, faith is not actualised and perfected except by loving the one whom Allaah loves (and loving) whatever Allaah loves,  "...<i>shall I not direct you to something which if you do will cause you to love each other? Spread the salutation (say <span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1603;&#1605;</span>) between yourselves</i>."    <P>
The spreading of sincere salutations for the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, between yourselves, may Allaah bless you, will actualize (and bring about) the desired eemaan which leads to entry into Paradise. Beware of all of the causes which distance you from Paradise and from them is mutual hatred. The affair of the one who is firm and upright upon the deen of Allaah is (always) in great danger. (You should) hate what Allaah hates, and you should love what Allaah loves. Hate kufr (disbelief) and hate innovations and misguidance, seeking nearness to Allaah, the Sublime and Exalted, in that. As for the one who is upon the true deen of Allaah, [that] you hate him and detest him, then this, by Allaah, is a very, very dangerous affair. This agitates (disturbs) eemaan and causes it to shake and it takes you (far) away from entering Paradise.    <P>
May Allaah bless you, so bring about mutual brotherly (love), and show mutual affection and show mutual love and visit each other with regards to (the affairs) between you and be like a fortified building, like a single body, when one part of it feels pain, the rest of the body responds to it with wakefulness and fever, just [as if they are] a single body. "<i>The example of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and affection (towards each other) is like the body, when one part of it feels pain, the entire body responds with wakefulness and fever</i>," the example of the believers in their mutual love, mercy, reflect upon these two points, "<i>The example of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and affection (towards each other) is like the body, when one part of it feels pain, the entire body responds with wakefulness and fever</i>." By Allaah, a truthful Salafi believer feels pain (for another) Salafi, even if he was in the furthest region of Japan, or furthest region of America. He (the true Salafi) rejoices with what pleases him (the other Salafi), and he grieves on account of what harms him.     <P>
Actualize this aqidah [after its verification], and (actualize) this way (mentioned above), and these manners, and may Allaah straighten your affair, unite the hearts upon the truth, and grant firmness upon His guidance to us and you, indeed our Lord is the Hearer of the supplication. And may Allaah send salaat and salaam upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his companions.   </blockquote>   <P>
