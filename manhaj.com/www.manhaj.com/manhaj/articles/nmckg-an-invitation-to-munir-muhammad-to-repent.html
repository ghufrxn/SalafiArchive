<div class="articleContent">
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>  In two previous articles (<a href=../indexc2c8.html?kckcv>here</a> and <a href=../indexc2c8.html?kckcv>here</a>) we highlighted <b>two major mistakes in Taw&#7717;&#299;d and &#703;Aq&#299;dah</b> made by Mu&#7717;ammad Mun&#299;r--an arrogant, pompous individual--who markets himself as a independent scholar and mufti (who gives fatwa), whilst belittling well-known Scholars of the Ummah. He made these two mistakes in <b>the space of just 9 minutes of each other</b> and he has a lot more mistakes than just these two which indicate the severity of his ignorance and his amazement with himself. If time allows, inshaa'Allaah, we will continue to pop his bubbles one by one, until the proof is established against his followers--as for him, it is already established against him.     <P>
One of those mistakes was that due to his ignorance of the creed of the Salaf, and the difference between it and that of the Jahmites and Ash&#703;arites, he made it possible for All&#257;h to <b>send down a man to be crucified for the atonement of humanity's sins</b>, in the course of argument with Christians. We explained how Shaykh al-Isl&#257;m Ibn Taymiyyah described this notion and others  as <b>foolish heresies that do not befit the most ignorant of the kings of the earth, let alone the the Lord of the Worlds</b>.    <P>
One of the Christians whom he was debating with said "Thank you" and extended his hand, and straight away, Mun&#299;r's hosts pulled him away, desiring to make a quick retreat.     <P>
<b>Christians are now thanking Mun&#299;r for validating their religion, the plausibility of All&#257;h having a son</b> (because Mun&#299;r said, "if it was His will for one man to come down and die on the cross"). How would a man "come down" and from where? Muslims believe Jesus was born on this earth, and so a Muslim would  not say "come down". The words "come down"--given that Christians are being spoken to--accommodates their belief that Jesus has a divine character, since he came from above as God in the form of man. So the shrewd Christians have picked upon this, and see this as a validation of their religion.    <P>
Thank you Mun&#299;r, what tremendous benefit your visit to the UK has been---for the Christians, and their associationism! And alongside this, Munir has now made a video trying to defend himself in vain and asking diversionary questions such as "Where did you study?" These are the tactics of <b>a bankrupt conman</b> who is trying to save face in front of his audience, to keep them captivated. And this appears to be of more serious concern to him, than his crime of validating the religion of those who worship Jesus (peace be upon him) as a deity alongside Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
