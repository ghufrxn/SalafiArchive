<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Following the role of Ahl al-Sunnah in the West of conveying the speech of the Scholars regarding certain figureheads who went astray, the followers of many of these figureheads spread doubts about some of the callers in the West, with respect to teaching and giving da'wah, claiming that a person must have a <a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> to teach, or he  must have graduated from an institution and so on. <b>However, the reality of the matter is that those whom they target in this way actually have  connections with the Scholars, they travel to them, and take knowledge from them in aqidah, manhaj and fiqh, even if they have not formally studied in an institution, or graduated or have a specific tazkiyah</b>. The real reason for these doubts is to undermine what the callers do in the West (in addition to calling to the Sunnah) of warning from doubts, innovations and desires and warning from the people who are upon them or promote them. The articles in these series will shed light on this matter and repel the doubts spread. No one article in this series should be read in isolation as it is possible for <u>a person with ulterior motives</u> to utilize some of these fatwas from the scholars to justify isolation and separation away from the main body of Salafis in that land and from their centres and mosques with the claim that everybody has the green light to teach, and so some of them teach in the mosques and centres of the hizbees and others teach in their homes (often secretly) whilst spreading poison that aims to isolate people from the students of knowledge. Rather, all the statements of all the Shaykhs <b>should be put together and understood collectively</b> to get a clearer picture of this whole affair. This is because there are generalizations in some fatwas, clarifications in others, important minor details in others, and contexts in some fatwas not found in others. All of this should be put together to get a full, comprehensive picture. <u>Alongside the clarifications in these articles</u>, it should be still be stressed that seeking knowledge from the Scholars, by travelling to them and sitting in their lessons is of utmost importance and should not be neglected as it is <u>the primary route</u> of seeking knowledge. And for those who are unable to do this, <b>then they should take from the students of knowledge in their lands, those who have connections with the Scholars, have studied with them and take from them.</b> So they should attend their lessons, in the Salafi mosques and centres, and any issues that arise such as requiring a fatwa, or removal of a <i>shubhah</i> or clarification in an issue of knowledge, then those students of knowledge can return these questions to the Scholars on behalf of the people of that land if the answer is not already known.     <P>
Here are links to all articles so far for easy reference:     <P>
<b>Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad</b> (<a href=../index67d0.html?fpjyl>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhali</b> (<a href=../index292c.html?xkdrv>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee</b> (<a href=../index7c01.html?rqltx>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen</b> (<a href=../index5b8a.html?pdziw>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> (<a href=../index4f73.html?xkjsh>see here</a>)   <b>Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree</b> (<a href=../index3c84.html?laknb>see here</a>)   <b>Shaykh Abdullah al-Ghudayan</b> (<a href=../indexbaf0.html?cajxz>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Rabee bin Haadee</b> (<a href=../indexa1a5.html?iknhb>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen</b> (<a href=../index5ea5.html?ccblo>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Ahmad Bazmul</b> (<a href=../indexd377.html?ibtpx>see here</a>)  <b>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</b> (<a href=../index3ed6.html?aninc>see here</a>).    <P>
.    <P>
<!---The bottom line is that knowledge can be sought from books and cassettes where it is not possible to take it directly from the scholars, though this is a longer and more burdensome route than taking it from the scholars directly. And it is not a condition that a person  must have a <a href='https://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/tags/tazkiyah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> from a scholar prior to teaching or giving da'wah. However, a person must know his limit and capability and not transgress it and not speak about matters he does not know and he must also seek to understand thoroughly that which he conveys so that where explanation is required he is able to explain that knowledge, and further, he must only resort to books of trusted, deeply-rooted scholars. <b>In all cases, the seeking of knowledge from the scholars directly is the quickest,  easiest route as it allows discussion and for clarifications to be made</b>. Whether a person is fit to convey and teach is known by two ways, either a <a href='https://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/tags/tazkiyah.cfm' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> from a scholar or by it being it well known by the people of his land that he has knowledge, understanding and ability. //--->  </blockquote></div> <P>

What follows is a series of short questions put to Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee (13th Jumada al-Ula 1433H) regarding the issue of teaching and conveying statements of scholars  (<a href=../assets/audio/knowl-tazkiyah-muhd-haadee.mp3>mp3</a>):    <P>
    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'><b>Questioner:</b> Is <a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> (commendation) a condition for a student of knowledge when he wishes to give fatwa or to teach? <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> Necessary, necessary, "<i>I did not sit (for giving fatwa) until it was said to me (to do so)</i>" Imaam Malik says. Yes, it is necessary that it is testified for him that he is fit (capable) of sitting to (teach) knowledge. <b>Questioner:</b> Some of our brothers O Shaykh are not known with this for example, he has studied and is known amongst his brothers with a sound  creed and a safe methodology,and his brothers know that in his teaching there is much benefit, but the Scholars do not know him, so how are we able to acquire a <a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> for him in this scenario? <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> This occurs with two ways: The first: Him being well known for knowledge, teaching and sitting (to benefit) the people in this field. The second: By way of commendation (<a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a>). So if he is (a) not known and (b) does not have commendation then he is not fit for giving verdicts whoever he is. As for when he has become known amongst the people for knowledge, teaching and striving in that, and is known for this, then this is sufficient for the people of his land.<b>Questioner:</b> He does not have a <a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> until even in the issue of teaching, he does not have a <a href='../tags/tazkiyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tazkiyah</font></a> from the people of knowledge for teaching to begin with. <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> (Knowledge) is not taken except from one who is known and he has become well known for that (in his land) or the people of knowledge have testified this for him, and this [either of these two] is necessary. <b>Questioner:</b> When he is known for sound creed and methodology but none of the Scholars know him, but the rest of his brothers testify for him with sound creed and methodology... <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> Being well known, they intend by this, being well known in the region in which he is, that the people (in that region) testify for him (that he has) knowledge and acquaintance, so when this becomes spread [word unclear] yes. <b>Questioner:</b> The beginner student of knowledge O Shaykh if he was to cite the fatwa of the major scholars and said, "The Scholars said such and such" without mentioning who the muftee (scholar) is... <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> This is a mistake, it is not acceptable. Who are the Scholars (then)?! <b>Questioner:</b> In our land they are not pleased with the likes of the major scholars - our Shaykh - those who senior in age, they do not know Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen and Shaykh <a href='../tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>. <b>Shaykh Muhammad:</b> If this is for a correct objective, the likes of this, then there is no harm in this.</blockquote> <P>
