<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><div align=center><b>UPDATES AT END OF ARTICLE</b></div><hr size=1 noshade>    <P>
This is documentation of history starting from 2004, the time when those affiliated with the <b>Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Haadeeth</b> (MJAH) and <b><a href='../tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a></b> (GLM) complex began to utilize <b>Shaikh Wasiullah Abbas</b> in order to undermine and destroy <b>Maktabah Salafiyyah</b> and to target its speakers. The historical record below should be used to evaluate and put into context what is happening now where a certain rebel group from within the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> nexus is spreading warnings from Shaykh Wasiullah and another Pakistani Shaykh from attending a conference this weekend (6th-8th September 2013) because two <b><a href='../tags/al-maghrib.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Maghrib</font></a></b> speakers are attending, they are <b>Waleed Basyouni</b> and <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b>. The main point of criticism used is that Tawfique Chowdhary is someone who put his name to a pledge of cooperation (in 2007) with Sufis and Ash'aris (learn about that in detail <b><a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=9&amp;Topic=6237>in this thread</a></b>).    <P>
<b>However, putting your name to a pledge of cooperation does not really add anything to the existing reality, where you have already been implementing the underlying manhaj in your da'wah. The pledge is just something formal. Keeping this in mind, Tawfique Chowdhary (al-Kauthar Institute) and <a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, Muhammad alShareef (<a href='../tags/al-maghrib-institute.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Maghrib Institute</font></a>) were already being invited to MJAH-GLM for lectures and sermons prior to that - whilst they were upon this very manhaj, practically speaking.</b> Our aim here is to point out the contradiction of those parties who are now using this issue of warning against the current administration of <a href='../tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a> and also to point out that whilst <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b> was the greatest of implementers of this particular manhaj for which Tawfique Chowdhary is now being declared an innovator and being warned against, he was staunchly defended and those who spoke against him were declared deviants and astray (through the speech of Shaykh Wasiullah).      <P>
<b><u>Note:</u></b> This article will expand and grow, please be sure to keep checking back regularly for updates. There is a lot more information present that will make the picture presented below even more concrete and vivid. However, there is enough information below for the reader to recognize a broad pattern and the historical truth and reality that cannot be denied, hidden or distorted any longer.  </blockquote>  </div>  <blockquote>    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-manchester-conference-deviants.png>Specimen:</a></b> A gathering in Manchester 2004. The list of speakers are: <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> (USA), Usama Hasan (London), <a href=http://www.salafis.com/tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.cfm>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</a> (Manchester), Murtaza Khan (London), <b>Tawfique Chowdhury (Australia)</b>, Abu Abdissalam (London), <b>Abu Aaliyah</b> (London), Nabeel Shahzad Ul-Haq (London), <b>Abu Muntasir</b> (Ipswich), <b>Saleem Abu Zubair</b> (London - <a href=http://www.themadkhalis.com/md/?ncprf>see full article here</a>) and others. Notice here Tawfique Chowdhary cooperating and lecturing with hardcore Qutbi Takfiris. This is Tawfique Chowdhary already upon this manhaj (without even having to put his name to any pledge). A man does not have to put his name to a paper in order for him to implement the methodology it comprises. No, a man can already be upon that methodology. Putting a name to a paper simply means he is not shy to make a public admission and display of it in writing.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-abuusamah-yqadhi-tchowd.gif>Specimen:</a></b> <b><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></b> lecturing alongside <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> and <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b> in 2004 at the Green Lane Masjid (MJAH) at a time when Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> were warning from all of these three individuals on account of the Ikhwani principles upon which they were operating their da'wah, and their cooperation with Hizbiyyeen.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glm-muh-shareef-01.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glm-qadhi-hanif-01.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glm-tawfiq-chowdh-01.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> <b>Muhammad alShareef</b>, <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> and <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b> lecturing at <a href='../tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a> between 2005 and 2007. Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> were warning from all three of these inviduals due to their misguidance and cooperation with various types of Ahl al-Bid'ah, just as they were warning from <b>MJAH-GLM</b> for inviting these people of deviation and misguidance. At the very same time, Shaykh Wasiullah was being invited to <b>MJAH-GLM</b> and used to undermine and attack Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. Those involved in using Shaykh Wasiullah for this objective are <u>a)</u> the very same people who are now spreading the criticism and warning of Shaykh Wasiullah against the 6th-8th September <b>MJAH-GLM</b> conference (with Tawfique Chowdhary and Waleed Basyouni) and <u>b)</u> Madeenah.Con.     <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-yasir-qadhi-naeem.jpg>Specimen</a></b>,   <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-yasir-qadhi-naeem2.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> This is <b>Naeem of al-Hidaayah</b> who is from the current MJAH-GLM administration. He is chairing a couple of talks of <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> on the MJAH-GLM platform. Not a whimper from those people back then, those who are now using Shaykh Wasiullah to warn from the current conference because Tawfique Chowdhary is attending. However, since 2004, they have been using Shaykh Wasiullah to attack and undermine Maktabah Salafiyyah! Further proof that the current MJAH-GLM rebels (and supporters such as Madeenah.Con) are upon contradiction and hypocrisy in their behaviour.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006a.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006b.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-muhd-adam-kawtharee-s-hasan.gif>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>Specimen:</a></b> A conference in Manchester (Didsbury Mosque) in June 2006. List of invited speakers include <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b>, <b>Muhammad bin Adam al-Kawthari</b> (sufi saint worshipper, gives fatwas inviting to shirk and denial of uluww of Allaah), <b>Mufti Yusuf Sacha</b> (Tablighi Maturidi Deobandi), <b>Riyadh al-Haqq</b> (Deobandi Maturidi), <b>Awadallah al-Azhari</b>, <b>Kehlan al-Jaboori</b>, <b><a href=http://www.salafis.com/tags/abu-eesa-niamatullah.cfm>Abu Eesa Niamatullah</a></b>. These specimens are clear proof that <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> was practically implementing the manhaj laid down in the pledge of 2007, before it ever saw the light of day by many long years (going way back into the 1990s in fact). Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> had been warning from this manhaj of <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> since 1996 where his cooperation with Ash'aris and Ikhwanis was well known. However, Shaykh Wasiullah was used to undermine and attack Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> for this very reason whilst today in 2013, because Tawfique Chowdhary put his name to a pledge in 2007 with Sufis, he is declared an innovator and the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> conference is warned against because he is attending. In all that time, these people who are now spreading this speech of Shaykh Wasiullah, they despised and detested that <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> should be warned against. Contradiction. Hypocrisy. Double standards.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-hasan-hamza-yu.gif>Specimen:</a></b> In the same year as the infamous Sufi pledge initiative (that Tawfique Chowdhary is being lambasted for), <b>Hamza Yusuf</b> published his translation of the Creed of al-Tahawi, for which <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b>, the most-prominent and important figure for <u>Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth</u>, wrote a praise and commendation for the translation, comprising a praise for Hamza Yusuf who is from the heads and callers of todays Jahmiyyah. This is from the greatest manifestations of treachery to the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah and its adherents. Despite this, no sign of any furore from those who are now leading the bandwagon against the current MJAH-GLM Admin. No fatwas elicited from Shaykh Wasiullaah against <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> for going further than what Tawfique Chowdhary has done (unless you have evidence to the contrary). Rather, only a year later (in 2008) a group of those waging war against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> wrote a defence of <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> and  got Shaykh Wasiullah to endorse it, and then it was distributed by Madeenah.Con (through Muhammad Akhtar Chaudhury).    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup_winterconf2007email_1.jpg>Specimen</a></b>,   <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-hasan-2009-goldie.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b> is here participating in the MJAH-GLM conferences of <u>December 2007</u> along with <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a>, and again in <u>April 2009</u>, along with Ahsan Haneef and <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a>. No one jumped to warn from this conference because a particular speaker (<a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>) has <u>a long and established history</u> of cooperating with and sharing platforms with Sufis, Ash'aris, grave-worshippers, Ikhwanis, Tablighis and the likes. On the contrary (see next paragraph below) they were too busy writing defences of <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> and the MJAH-GLM complex and were distributing them against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, getting such <a href='../tags/refutations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>refutations</font></a> approved and endorsed by Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-defence-of-mjah.gif>Specimen:</a></b> A document checked and approved by Shaikh Wasiullah Abbas in 2008, written by a group of people some of whom are affiliated with Madeenah.Con (such as <a href='../tags/abdur-raoof-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Raoof Muhammad</font></a> - <a href=../indexd186.html?brzgd>see here</a>). This document was used to defend <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> and MJAH-GLM against the criticisms directed at them by Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and the calamities of <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> and other heads of Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth were given lame excuses and justified. An updated version was released in June 2009 and this document was mass-promoted by Muhammad Akhtar Chadhury of <a href='../tags/madeenahcom.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Madeenah.Com</font></a> (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-rauf-defence-suhaibwebb.jpg>specimen</a></b>). This indicates the continued connection between Abdul-Raoof and the Madeenah.Con network of individuals.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup_tawfchoudh-2007.gif>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-qadhi-lecture-2007.gif>Specimen:</a></b> Lectures by <b>Tawfique Chawdhury</b> (April 2007) and <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b> (June 2007) at the <b>MJAH-GLM</b>. This is after Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> had been warning against these individuals for <u>at least seven years prior</u>. Meanwhile, allies of MJAH-GLM were waging war against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/abdur-raoof-madeenah-com.gif>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/madeenah-com-authors-sep-20.gif>Specimen:</a> </b> A list of Madeenah.Con members and contributors from 2007 and 2013. Note all the names: <b><a href='../tags/abdur-raoof-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abdur-Raoof Muhammad</font></a></b>, <b>Tahir Wyatt</b>,  <b>Muhammad Akhtar Chaudhury</b>, <b>Nadir Ahmad</b>, <b>Shadeed Muhammad</b>, <b>Zulfiker Ibrahim al-Memoni</b>, <b>Ismaa'eel bin Yusuf</b>,  <b>Farhan Safdar</b>, <b>Mu'awiyah Tucker</b> and <b>Naveed Ayaz</b>. The latter (Naveed Ayaz) is a relative newcomer but a fervent pusher of the <i>tamyee'ee</i> manhaj that unites all of these individuals in their collective hate and oppposition to the clear, unambiguous manhaj traversed by the Salafis. Naveed Ayaz supports and cooperates with the MJAH network of mosques whilst spreading hate and aversion against those affiliated with Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glm-wasiullah-pledge-signers.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-mountiman-wasiulla.gif>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup_mountimangifbanner_1.gif>Specimen:</a></b> A conference held in 2008 by MJAH-GLM where <b>Shaykh Wasiullah</b> is lecturing along with two of those who had put their names to the pledge, <b>Haitham al-Haddad</b> and <b>Abdur-Raheem Greene</b>. This is a year after the Sufi pledge issue (<a href=http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=9&amp;Topic=6237>see here</a>). We never saw those who are spreading Shaykh Wasiullah's <i>tabdee'</i> of against Tawfique Chowdhary showing any concern for the matter at that time. So here it is arranged for Shaykh Wasiullah to lecture alongside two individuals who put their names to that pledge (a year after it was refuted), and at the same time war is waged against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> - and all those parties join and collaborate in this war (MJAH-GLM, Luton, Madeenah.Con).    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-july_2009_auk.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> <b><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></b> (MJAH-GLM Imaam and lecturer) participating with <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b>, <b>Waleed Basyouni</b> and <b>Abdur-Raheem Green</b> (and others) in a 2009 conference (two years after the Sufi pledge). Two of them put their names to the Sufi pledge of 2007. This is almost two years after the pledge was refuted and annihilated. We did not see those who currenty spreading the warning of Shaykh Wasiullah against the MJAH-GLM conference of 6th-8th September 2013 and his tabdee' of Tawfique Chowdhary make any moves here. No, instead they were using Shaykh Wasiullah to malign and attack Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and its callers. Contradiction and hypocrisy. Notice how also in this current turmoil at MJAH-GLM, <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a> is largely shielded from any type of criticism. No verdicts (to date) have been elicited with respect to him. Why? Because he is a staunch hater, an instrumental player in the hate, propaganda and psychological warfare against those who value and implement the Salafi manhaj in speech and action. He has been of great practical value to them and  may continue to be no matter what the outcome of the current turmoil. Hence, even though factions amongst them have been polarized, all of them recognize the value this man provides them in the war against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>.    <P>
<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup_summer-2012-Basyouni.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> A conference at MJAH-GLM only one year ago in September 2012 where <b><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></b> (Imaam of GLM) is participating in a conference where <b>Waleed Basyouni</b>, (an Ikhwani, upon the path of Ali al-Timimi) was also invited to attend. No sign of any rejection from those people who are now kicking up a fuss and using Shaykh Wasiullah to warn from MJAH-GLM's conference (of September 2013) where Tawfique Chowdhary (who also put his name to that Sufi pledge of mutual understanding and cooperation) is in attendance.    <P>

Keep in mind all these connections exist whilst all these parties were spreading the attacks of Shaykh Wasiullah against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and at the same time that MJAH-GLM were inviting <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b>, <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b>, <b>Muhammad alShareef</b> (and others) for conferences, lectures and khutbahs.

This statement from the Shaykh was engineered by the same crowd who are now using the speech of Shaykh Wasiullah to warn from MJAH-GLM and its conference of 6th-8th September 2013. However, when they were challenged on this issue, and <b>Shaykh Ahmad al-Subay'ee</b> (Kuwait) demanded them to provide evidence for the slanders for whose propagation Shaykh Wasiullah was made to be the vehicle (for the mischief-makers), <u>they (Madeenah.Con) were forced to withdraw this article</u>, and then they put up a clarification which contains much talbees (deception) in that they hid the true and real reason why they were forced to remove it (<a href=../assets/images/glm-removalofwaseeullaahspeech.png>specimen</a>). It was because a demand was made for them by Shaykh Ahmad to provide specific evidence to back up Shaykh Wasiullah's claims, and they could not. So instead they put up a clarification with their claim that the article was misunderstood and being used wrongly in order to "create a scandal" and "after consulting with Shaykhs in Madinah" they decided to remove the article - when the reality was that had <u>Shaykh Ahmad al-Subay'ee</u> not put them in the corner <b>they would never have</b> taken the article down. Instead to conceal what had been taking place behind the scenes, they made it look as if through consultation with Shaykhs in Madinah (without naming a single one of them) they decided to take the article down. <b>Nadir Ahmed</b> (Madeenah.Con) was the key person involved in this incident and the deceptions involved therein. <b>This was a case of engineered lying and Machiavellian conniving</b>.

No movements made against him for this by those who are currently spreading the warning by Shayk Wasiullah against the 6th-8th September conference of MJAH-GLM and spreading Shaykh Wasiullah's tabdee' of Tawfique Chowdhary (because he cooperates with Sufis, Ash'aris). The reason is because at the same time they were too busy trying to destroy Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, using Shaykh Wasiullah for that end, while Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> had been warning against MJAH-GLM because they were inviting, promoting and cooperating with deviants such as Muhammad alShareef, <a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, Tawfique Chowdhary and others.     <P>

<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-auk-makhchaudhury.jpg>Specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-mad-com-abu-usamah-conf.jpg>Specimen:</a></b>  <b>Muhammad Akhtar Chaudhury</b>  who is the <b>Madeenah.Con</b> architect is lecturing with <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a> (July 2013), indicating the connection between Madeenah.Con and MJAH-GLM Imaam and speaker, <a href='../tags/abu-usamah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah</font></a>. This falsifies the attempt (only yesterday) by Madeenah.Con to distance themselves from MJAH-GLM (these are the blatant lies of insincere politicians). They are telling blatant lies despite the fact that their support of MJAH-GLM from 2005 onwards is mutawaatir. Their deception is that they try to deflect criticism from Madeenah.Con because the one who sends out promotionals is Muhammad Akhtar Chaudhury (Fatwa-Online, FOL) through his email lists and on this basis they try to distinguish between FOL and Madeenah.Con. However, names do not mean anything. It's not the <u>domain name or website</u> that is sending out the articles and emails in support of MJAH-GLM (and attacks upon Maktabah Salafiyyah) - as that is impossible. <b>It is a person</b>. It is the people running the show on the basis of which we make connections. <u>Muhammad Akhtar Chaudhury is the owner of Madeenah.Con and he set that operation up</u>. So Madeenah.Con has been supporting the MJAH-GLM complex. The aim being to destroy Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> so that when they return back to this country, the only network remaining is the Ikhwani, Tamyee'ee network of MJAH-GML within whose framework they can continue their own da'wah - because their hearts are alike.    <P>

This shows that Tawfique Chaudhury or Walid Basyouni having made agreements with Sufis means little to him. So why should he turn around now?

No, that activity is only reserved for Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, because Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> have been warning against <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> for the very same for which Tawfique Chaudhury (and the conference) are now being warned against, and they've being doing that for at least 13 years.    <P>
<b>08-09-2013</b> <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-abdalhadi-conf-taw.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> The conference warned against by Shaykh Wasiullah (because of <b>Tawfique Chaudhury</b> attending, whom Shaykh Wasiullah  made <i>tabdee'</i> of because he put his name to a pledge of mutual understanding with Sufis, Ash'aris) has kicked off this weekend. In the <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-abdalhadi-conf-taw.jpg>specimen</a></b> we see <b>Abdul-Hadi Omari</b> (the <u>ameer</u> of Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth) sat next to the "innovator" Tawfique Chaudhury. He is second from the right, with Tawfique Chaudhury on the far right. Looks like <b>the heads of Ahl al-Hadeeth</b> in the UK are not quite maintaining the standard expected of them. But what else can you expect when Abdul-Hadi Omari has in the past praised Ahmad Reza Barelwi stating, "<i>Also, Ahmad Reza Khan from the Brelwee school of thought, who was a great scholar of the religion who has written many books</i>" and you have the most senior and elder of them, <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b> sitting next to one who openly calls to saint-worship, seeking istighaathah from the dead and denial of the uluww of Allaah the Exalted  (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>specimen</a></b>,  <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>specimen</a></b>). That's <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> sat next to "Mufti" <b>Muhammad bin Adam al-Kawthari</b> who gives fatwas inviting the masses to shirk with Allaah, the Exalted. And this type of manhaj in da'wah is known from <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> since the 1990s, and his support and protection of al-Ikhwan is a matter known. It looks like Shaykh Wasiullah's request for Ahl al-Hadeeth to take the initiative to put things right at this conference is in vain and will fall on deaf ears. This is because <u>the heads of Ahl al-Hadeeth</u> (who have been vigorously defended against valid criticisms brought against them by Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> since the late 1990s) are upon <u>the very same manhaj</u> for which <i>tabdee'</i> of Tawfique Chaudhury has been elicited from Shaykh Wasiullah by a certain faction. Except that Abdul-Hadi Omari and <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> haven't put their name on paper to make it official whereas Tawfique Chaudhury has - but in all honesty, you cant say Tawfique Chaudhury sits <u>right next</u> to saint-worshippers who call to their shirk (unless you have evidence, <u>then send it to us</u>). In short, Shaykh Wasiullah has been used by a rebel group within the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> network to help mobilize their agenda against the current administration and their drawing the Shaykh into this matter has opened a can of worms. Realities have started to flood out and are penetrating minds that were previously not penetrable.     <P>
<b>08-09-2013</b> <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-zulfiker-irshad.jpg>Specimen</a></b>,  <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-zulfiker-guard-gra.jpg>Specimen:</a></b> It is brought to our attention that <b>Zulfiker Ibrahim al-Memoni</b> sent out a short communication on 3rd September (28th Shawwaal) in order to strengthen and emphasize the previous warning by Shaykh Wasiullah. It comprises a summary of a discussion with a shaykh from Pakistan who affirms and supports the warning by Shaykh Wasiullah against the current MJAH-GLM conference. Zulfiker Ibrahim was involved with the <u>Madeenah.Con</u> group from 2005 onwards. He was part of a group responsible for attempts in 2005 to clean up the image of MJAH-GLM by  presenting a certain positive picture of MJAH-GLM in Madeenah (to one of the Mashayikh) and these tactics were part of the overall agenda of Madeenah.Con to elicit negative speech against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> whilst shielding MJAH-GLM from criticism. In this <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-zulfiker-guard-gra.jpg>specimen</a></b> we see an example of Zulfiker Ibrahim being marketed as "<b>Guard of the Prophet's Grave."</b> We have never known any of the people of knowledge, students or even others who have made it a point to deliberately make themselves known with such a title - this is the type of promotional you expect from Sufis. In any case, Zulfiker Ibrahim sent out this communication to emphasize Shaykh Wasiullah's warning against the conference because Tawfique Chowdhary is present. <u>The irony here</u> is that the likes of Zulfiker Ibraham al-Memoni (within the Madeenah.Con network) were shielding MJAH-GLM on the one hand and on the other, waging a cowardly stealth war against Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> during the time that they (Maktabah Salafiyyah) were (consistently and uniformly)  speaking against <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> for the likes of this: (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006a.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006b.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-muhd-adam-kawtharee-s-hasan.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>specimen</a></b>). And also during the very time that <b><a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a></b>, <b>Muhammad alShareef</b> and <b>Tawfique Chowdhary</b> were being invited to MJAH-GLM.  <u>Today</u> they are using Shaykh Wasiullah to make <i>tabdee'</i> upon Tawfique Chowdhary and warn from the MJAH-GLM conference he is attending and <u>yesteryear(s)</u> they were using Shaykh Wasiullah to destroy Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> because they (Maktabah Salafiyyah) were warning against <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> (for cooperating with Sufis, Ash'aris, grave-worshippers, and his very apparent broad Ikhwani manhaj) and warning from MJAH-GLM for inviting the likes of <a href='../tags/yasir-qadhi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yasir Qadhi</font></a>, Tawfique Chowdhary and others on to their platform. <b>All praise is due to Allaah who has exposed the hypocritical behaviour of these people from the UK in their da'wah and their dealings in broad daylight.</b>    <P>
