<div class='sidebar'><blockquote><b>This is a piece of important historical record. Please be sure to read the notes at the end to put it into context.</b>     <P>
Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee al-Madkhalee spoke about <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> <u>17 years ago</u> (in December 1996) and this was five months after the Shaykh's visit to the UK in July 1996 to partake in a conference along with Shaykh al-Anjaree and Shaykh Abdus-Salaam Burjis (rahimahullaah)</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
The Shaykh said, when presented with a leaflet advertising a conference in which a large number of the heads of al-Ikhwan (Muslim Brotherhood) were attending:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='../images/quote-start.gif'>Then what we have seen and have noticed from Shaikh Suhaib is that he is sympathetic and affectionate towards Ikhwaan ul-Muslimeen - he wants that he should deny that - a matter that we saw ourselves. In the summer that has past when I came to you and took part in the conferences which you held here in Birmingham. Some [written] questions came forward which were asking about the jamaa'ah of Ikhwaan and other jamaa'ahs of <a href='../tags/hizbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizbiyyah</font></a> and these questions would be passed on to Shaikh Suhaib and he would conceal and hide them - he did not desire to read them to me - and they were directed to me, asking about Ikhwaan ul-Muslimeen and about specific individuals and <a href='../tags/jamaaaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jamaa'aat</font></a>. And if it was not for the Brother al-Anjaraee - whom Allaah Azzawajall had placed there - and he was next to us and he knows the English language well - I would not have known that because the questions were written in the English language. And Shaikh Suhaib was disturbed that he should read them out because the Brother al-Anjaree requested that from him - or he himself informed me, that Shaikh Suhaib is doing that - so Shaikh Suhaib was disturbed and unsettled that he should read them - reluctant and unpleased that he should read them. This is the first thing. As for the second then Shaikh Suhaib - from what has reached us - it has not reached us in such and such a way - but rather it has reached is in written form - something acknowledged officially, and if these words are a lie against him then let him [Shaikh Suhaib] publicise his freedom from it. So in Britain a conference was held in the month of Sha'baan from the 11th to the 13th in the year 1417 from Saturday to Monday - by the Muslim Students Society (MSS) of the United Kingdom and Eire. And it was the 35th conference - and this is pure and unadulterated Ikhwaani conference - and the one who knows the nature of this jam'iyyah knows this. And <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> was invited to it and his name is amongst the names of those who were present in this gathering. And this sheet of paper [poster] is a means of publicity for it which has been distributed and listen to those who have been invited to this conference: Faisal Mawlawi, Raashid al-Ghanouchi, Saleem al-Husanee or al-Husnee, Isaam al-Basheer, Ibraaheem as-Sanoussi, Fahmi Huwaidi - and the Ikhwaan suspect Fahmi Huwaidi of being a secularist! So how can they unite with him let alone that Shaikh Suhaib enters [the conference] and who thinks that he is a Salafi - Kamaal al-Helbawi, Munir Ahmad, Hasan Yoosuf, Hasan Huwaidi, Ahmad ash-Shaikh, <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>, Ahmad Mansoor, Usaamah at-Takreeti and others. And all of them are doctors as there is a prefix before each of their names so they indicate: The Ustaadh and Dotor Saleem al-Husanee, or al-Husnee, Doctor Issaam al-Basheer, Doctor Ibraaheem as-Sanoussi, Ustaadh Fahmi Huwaidi, Doctor Kamal al-Helbawi, Doctor Munir Ahmad, Ustaadh Hasan Yoosfuf, Doctor Hasan Huwaidi, Shaikh Ahmad ash-Shaikh from Somalia, Shaikh <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>, the Ustaadh and Doctor Ahmad Mansoor, Usaamah al-Takreeti and others. So they are a group of people from Ikhwaan ul-Muslimeen. Rather there are some amongst them whom the Ikhwaan ul-Muslimeen consider to be amongst their enemies such as Fahmi Huwaidi. So how can this man [Suhaib Hasan] come together with them. Then it reached me that he did not attend because he became ill or went to the hospital. I say that it is binding upon him - as he has been gathered in the ranks of those and it is not possible that his name is mentioned [in the list of the those who have been invited] except with [his] pleasure. And if this had been written [without his consent] then it is necessary for him to bring out and to publicise his freedom and innocence from this gathering and from taking part in this gathering...</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote><b>Source:</b> Translated (Abu Iyaad) from the original cassette in 1996, cassette provided by Amr Basheer. Prepared as part of a series of documents (with translations from Abu Talhah Dawud Burbank) and printed/distributed by Amr Basheer, Abu Khadeejah - the "<b>Blazing Meteors</b>" series. This series was aimed at protecting the Salafi da'wah from the da'wah of Ihyaa al-Turaath which was being imported into the UK by <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b>, <b>al-Hidaayah</b> (current <b>MJAH-GLM</b> Admin), <b><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></b> and others. Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> took the da'wah in the direction of clarity, separating bid'ah from sunnah, and separating blameworthy <a href='../tags/hizbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizbiyyah</font></a> from walaa and baraa around and upon the usool of the Sunnah. Al-Hidaayah (current GLM admin), <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>, the MJAH-GLM complex and individuals like <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a> took the direction of Ihyaa al-Turaath.    <P>
So whilst Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> were warning against this manhaj of <i><a href='../tags/tamyee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>tamyee'</font></a></i> (at a time when Ihyaa al-Turath were pushing the thought of <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> and Sayyid Qutb to Salafi audiences), <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> continued and remained upon this path, <u>right until this day of ours</u> and he has been a caller to <a href='../tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a> and cooperation between Ahl al-Sunnah and the Ikhwani organizations and structures in the UK. Rather, he cooperates and sits right next to grave-worshippers who call to their grave-worship and Jahmite creed (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006a.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006b.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-muhd-adam-kawtharee-s-hasan.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>specimen</a></b>). Throughout this entire period, many people claiming <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> fought against those Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> for warning against <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> and his Ikhwani, Turathi manhaj. Today the realities are clear walhamdulillaah, and <u>they would have remained clear since the mid-90s</u> had there not been found people who became betrayers, those who abandoned the truth and misguided many of the youth who had an opportunity to be guided to <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> upon its clarity, away from the snares from the Hizbiyyeen. Many of those who are now involved in the MJAH-GLM Fiasco (see   <a href=../indexb0e1.html?cnejc>here</a>, <a href=../indexd186.html?brzgd>here</a>, <a href=../index8121.html?amorz>here</a>, <a href=../index2743.html?mjghq>here</a>) were waging war and working stratagems to undermine Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> through all that time because they were simply calling to clarity, away from dubious callers and Shaykhs like <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> who had their own Ikhwani, Turathi agendas in mind, and a wishy-washy da'wah which they wanted totally divorced from any connection with overseas Mashayikh - except what could be channelled through <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> without disturbing the order of things he had in mind for the UK. These people included "Sidi" Abu Aaliyah who started playing this game in 1997 when these clarifications were coming out. Then there were those who used Shaykh Wasiullah from 2004 onwards in order to undermine and attack Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> for the same reasons and objectives, <u>to defend the heads of Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth in the UK</u>. There were other attempts besides these too. The bottom line is - the reality of <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> has been known for a very long time.     <P>
<b>Today, the realities have become apparent in that what Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> were warning against since 1996 <u>has come full circle</u> and <u>manifested itself openly</u> in the latest MJAH-GLM Fiasco (see <a href=../indexb0e1.html?cnejc>here</a>, <a href=../indexd186.html?brzgd>here</a>, <a href=../index8121.html?amorz>here</a>, <a href=../index2743.html?mjghq>here</a>).  Everything that has taken place in this MJAH-GLM fiasco has vindicated the direction taken in da'wah from the mid-90s (by the Salafis) to such a degree that even the Shaykh who was used from the mid-2000s (Shaykh Wasiullah) to attack and undermine Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> has now - (on account the activities of a rebel group from within the MJAH-GLM network) - issued a warning and fatwa of boycott of the recent conference of MJAH-GLM because they are inviting a person (Tawfique Chowdhary) who cooperates with Ahl al-Bid'ah and has mutual agreements and understandings with them. Doesn't that sound familiar in the person of Suhaib Hasan?</b>    <P>
<b>Note Regarding Tawfique Chowdhary:</b> As a confused youth who had only just come out of atheism a few years earlier, Tawfique Chowdhary would email Abu Khadeejah and Abu Iyaad in 1996/1997 for advice and direction because he was confused. However, he engaged in blameworthy debate with Ali al-Timimi and Idris Palmer (on issues of <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a>, haakimiyyah) who obviously wiped the floor with him, leaving him more confused. This was the source of his subsequent misguidance, which is Ikhwaaniyyah in perception, outlook and da'wah. In this confused state of mind he entered the Islamic University of Madinah and he came out with that state of mind cemented, the end result of which is putting his names to mutual agreements with understandings with grave-worshippers, deniers of al-uluww and incuding them within the "<i>broad fold of Sunni Islam</i>."  </blockquote>    <P>
