<blockquote><b>This article cannot really be appreciated without relevant background and history, so you are going to have to show a little patience with us on this one, but in the end, it will be very rewarding inshaa'Allaah, and you will start seeing the bigger picture. Always remember, you can't understand what's happening around you now until you study the history of what led to the current. Then you can make connections and make sense of what is going on. In this article we are going to try and make sense of the current fiasco behind the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> conference of September 6th-8th 2013 in light of an article published in the Kuwaiti <u>al-Watan</u> newspaper today (September 11th 2013). </b> </blockquote>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>  <font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction and Background</font>    <P>
In 1928, a Hasafi Sufi by the name of <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> founded al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon (the Muslim Brotherhood), a society founded upon earlier organizations set up by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani al-Baatinee al-Raafidee. The "golden principle" of al-Ikhwan was "<b>Let us cooperate in that which we agree and overlook each other in that which we disagree</b>." This principle of unqualified, unrestricted cooperation (with deviants) destroyed many important foundational principles of the religion, and from their main ones, <i>al-walaa wal-baraa</i> for the <i>usool</i> of Ahl al-Sunnah in creed and methodology. Another prominent figure was Sayyid Qutb who brought in a violent, takfiri, revolutionary ideology into the ranks of the Muslim <a href='../tags/brotherhood.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>brotherhood</font></a> in the 1960s. These <u>two strains</u>, defined by these two individuals, characterize the Ikhwani thought and ideology as a whole and are two sides of the same coin which work in unison together. Uniting people into a mass (irrespective of creed and methodology) and mobilizing them into whatever form of <u>political agitation</u> is suitable and appropriate in the circumstances (in whatever nation), be that <u>a)</u> violent revolution <u>b)</u> "peaceful" revolution <u>c)</u> entry into democracy and party-politics <u>d)</u> coups and assassinations or <u>e)</u> political alliances with those who are otherwise considered enemies - all for the purpose of attaining power. Pay attention to these keywords: <b><a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a></b>, <b>hakimiyyah</b>, "<b><a href='../tags/islamic-awakening.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Islamic Awakening</font></a></b>", <b>freedom</b>, <b>justice</b>, <b>democracy</b>, <b>human rights</b>, <b>civil society</b> and so on. It's outside the scope of this article for us to make all the connections for you, but these are all linked and they form part of the da'wah politics that has become the poison infecting the Muslim Ummah in the 20th and 21st centuries. This poisoned, corrupt da'wah is then manipulated and used by the enemies of Islam to help them further their own objectives for Muslim societies and nations. This (Ikhwani) ideological da'wah made inroads into various communities of Salafis and people who became influenced by their ideas and doctrines (from amongst the Salafis) became callers to this poison. Numerous waves afflicted the body of Salafis (in various places) and these waves are as follows:     <P>
<blockquote><b><u>The 1st Wave:</u></b> <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> and Sayyid Qutb, constituting the two strains of Ikhwaaniyyah, or to put it another way, <u>a framework of (false) perceptions and outlooks</u> from which follow innovated principles that clash with the Sunnah and the methodology of the Salaf, which we can label collectively as <b>Qutbitude</b> and <b>Bannaawitude</b> respectively. These frameworks are what we have seen - historically - descending upon unsuspecting Salafis in every place through the activities of misguided individuals, callers and organizations, many of whom make the claim of <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> or attachment to hadeeth and aathaar. And the explanation of that is in what follows of the remaining waves:    <P>
 <b><u>The 2nd Wave (Kuwaiti Leg)</u></b>: Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq (Ikhwani from <a href='../tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, moved to Kuwait and began calling to his Ikhwaniyyah). From his followers, <u>Abdullah al-Sabt</u>, <u>Adnaan Abd al-Qadir</u>, <u>Abdur-Razzaaq al-Shayijee</u> and other straying wanderers. Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaliq brought the two strains of Ikhwaniyyah to Salafi audiences not unlike the Ash'arites of the 5th century hijrah brought the doctrines of al-Jahm and al-Ja'd, clothing their denial of Allah's <i>uluww</i> and <i>ru'yah</i> in new sophisticated language aimed at concealing the reality of what they were saying and its true origins. In the same way, Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq invented new slogans and principles by which he aimed to spread the ideology of Qutb and Banna to a Salafi audience in a covert manner. Destructive, forbidden and condemned splitting of the Ummah justified under the slogan of "<b>permissibility of the multiplicity of <a href='../tags/groups.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>groups</font></a> (<i>ta'addud al-jamaa'aat</i>)</b>," <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of rulers and their governments justified under the slogan of "<b>tawhid al-haakimiyyah</b>" (as an independent fourth category of tawheed), engagement in corrupt political activity, through existing political structures, including entry into parliamentary democracy justified under the label of "<b>legislated collective work (<i>mashroo'iyyat al-'amal al-jamaa'ee</i>)</b>" and so on. The organization of <b>Ihyaa al-Turaath</b> - which operates upon and spreads the thought of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq (who synthesized the thought of Qutb and Banna for a Salafi audience) became a vehicle for the spread of this destructive thought. With the wealth it amassed and continues to amass, it went and split Salafi communities across the globe, in Kuwait, <a href='../tags/yemen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yemen</font></a>, Sudan, Saudi and and they also began to operate in the West, coming to the UK and the US.    <P>
 <b><u>The 2nd Wave (Saudi Arabian Leg)</u></b>: <b><a href='../tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b>, <b>Safar al-Hawali</b>, the <a href='../tags/qutbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Qutbiyyah</font></a> of Saudi Arabia, tutored by <u>Muhammad Suroor</u> and <u>Muhammad Qutb</u> respectively, began calling to <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and haakimiyyah and ideologies of Sayyid Qutb, and began to belittle the major scholars, tearing the youth away from them. Al-Hawali pushed the <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> and haakimiyyah whilst <a href='../tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a> (alongside his mass, unrestricted takfir) laid down false principles and authored works to push the principle of <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a> of cooperation with people of different creeds. His novel approach (to augment that of Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq's) was to differentiate between <i>al-firqah al-naajiyah</i> (the saved sect) and <i>al-taa'ifah al-mansoorah</i> (the aided group). He claimed that the aided group are the people of hadeeth, sunnah and aathaar and as for the saved sect then all the various <a href='../tags/jamaaaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jamaa'aat</font></a> enter into it. His objective was the same as Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaaliq's which was the same as that of Hasan al-Banna's. To mobilize the masses, irrespective of which creed or sect or group they belong to and get them involved in political work. </blockquote>    <P>
We now move to subsequent waves, all of whom have connections to the <u><a href='../tags/jamiyyah-ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jam'iyyah Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a></u> to one degree or another. This is a crucial fact to note, in that all of the following individuals have or had connections (some of them financial) to Ihyaa al-Turaath or its sister organizations. While Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth (<a href='../tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a>) hereafter referred to as <b>MJAH-GLM</b> has had connections to Ihyaa al-Turaath, it may not have had any direct connections to the individuals below, even though the manhaj they all represent and implement is the same.    <P>
<blockquote> <b><u>The 3rd Wave:</u></b> <b><a href='../tags/adnan-aroor.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Adnan Ar'oor</font></a></b>, <b>Muhammad al-Maghrawi</b> Then came Adnaan Ar'oor who laid down  more sophisticated principles whose aims were the same as those of his precedecessors, but trying to veil the realities. From his principles are "<b>we correct the mistake but do not disparage the person (<i>nusahhih wa laa nujarrih</i>)</b>" which actually has the same objective as the golden principle of <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a>. Although he was not the pioneer of this saying, he also pushed the innovated principle of <i>al-muwaazanah</i>, which requires that when refuting a person, his good elements <u>must</u> be mentioned too, to avoid oppressing him. This is a false, corrupt principle and in reality, the aim behind it was to neutralize the deserved criticism made against deviants and to protect their standing. He was refuted by a body of the Salafi Scholars. Then at the end of the last century, right at the end of 1990s, al-Maghrawi was taken to task for his mass <a href='../tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of Muslim societies and nations, and his revolutionary ideologies. This signaled a new era in the battle between Ikhwaaniyyah and <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, especially considering that around this same time, three great Imaams of <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, Imaam <a href='../tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, Imaam Ibn Baz, Imaam Ibn al-Uthaymeen, passed away (may Allaah have mercy upon them). </blockquote>    <P>
This third wave in turn exposed subsequent waves (4th and 5th below), who, having kept company, friendship and cordiality with the 3rd wave, found it hard to heed the warnings of the Scholars regarding them. They made excuses for them and whilst keeping company with them, instead of showing walaa and baraa for the creed and methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah, they began to <u>invent principles</u> aimed at <u>undermining</u> the valid refutations and justified criticisms of the Scholars against those deviants, and justified their own continued cooperation and friendship with those same people (or jam'iyyaat)  despite their own admission and acknowledgement that these people have deviations and in some cases despite having refuted these deviations themselves already! There are two main representatives of this way:    <P>
<blockquote>  <b><u>The 4th Wave:</u></b> <b><a href='../tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a></b>, a former takfiri, ikhwani from <a href='../tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a> who made his way to <a href='../tags/yemen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yemen</font></a> and made a series of visits to some of the Major Scholars. After having gained acceptance and waiting for the passing away of the Major Scholars, he announced his great revolution and began to lay down his principles for the silencing of Ahl al-Sunnah and opening the prison doors for the Hizbiyyeen. His principles were a sophisticated rehash and reformulation of what his predecessors had tried to achieve. He tried to undermine the criticisms and refutations made by the Scholars against Sayyid Qutb and Muhammad al-Maghrawi (and others). His claim that <b>khabar al-aahaad amounts to dhann</b> (laying the foundations to reject the speech and criticism of scholars against innovators), his principle of "<b>verification (tathabbut)</b>" aimed at undermining the criticism of the Scholars and emboldening the youth to reject the advices and directions of the Scholars, his principle of "<b>rejecting taqleed</b>" sounds good until you understand what he meant by it and how he implemented it. His principle of "<b>the broad vast manhaj (<u>al-manhaj al-waasi'</u>)</b>" which meant to broaden the manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah to allow accommodation of <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> and <a href='../tags/sects.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sects</font></a> such as al-Ikhwan and others, just another reformulation of the principles of <a href='../tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a>, Abdul-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq and <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a>. All of these slogans and principles were another level of sophistication to push the <u>Bannaawitude</u> of <a href='../tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a>, done in a way to escape the stealth radar and hawk-eyes from the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah - but this conniving innovator was not successful walhamdulillaah, and today his realities are plain and clear for everyone to see (see his views and opinions over the past few years).    <P>
<b><u>The 5th Wave:</u></b> Then there came <b><a href='../tags/ali-hasan-al-halabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ali Hasan <a href="../tags/al-halabi.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">al-Halabi</font></a></font></a></b> and he was known for <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and spoken well of in the 1990s but he took the same path and this was the result of unsavoury connections with Ihyaa al-Turaath, al-Maghrawi, al-Ma'ribee and others. So he began to invent principles in turn in order to defend his own conduct in da'wah of friendship with those whose <i>bid'ah</i> and <i>dalaalah</i> had become manifest and plain, and taking money from Ikhwani organizations such as Ihyaa al-Turaath. Out came his principles, "<b>there must be ijmaa' (consensus) in tabdee'</b>", demolishing thereby 1400  years of the disparagement of Ahl al-Sunnah against the <a href='../tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> without there being consensus on the vast majority of them. But the greatest of his principles was the reformulation of the very principle of al-Hasan al-Bannah, so <a href='../tags/al-halabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Halabi</font></a> uttered (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1604;&#1575; &#1606;&#1580;&#1593;&#1604; &#1582;&#1604;&#1575;&#1601;&#1606;&#1575; &#1601;&#1610; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575; &#1587;&#1576;&#1576;&#1575;&#1611; &#1604;&#1604;&#1582;&#1604;&#1575;&#1601; &#1576;&#1610;&#1606;&#1606;&#1575;</span>), "<i>We do not make the differences between ourselves regarding others as a cause of differing between us</i>" - in other words, what <a href='../tags/al-halabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Halabi</font></a> is saying that since he and his likes have not taken with acceptance the tabdee' and warnings of the scholars against al-Maghrawi, Ar'oor and other Qutbis, Takfiris, and they claim a "difference of opinion", that such differences such should not be made a cause of differing. In other words, we can accommodate the aqidah of the Khawarij found with Ar'oor and al-Maghrawi, and not make this a cause of differing.  And also his saying (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1604;&#1586;&#1605;&#1606;&#1610;</span>), "<i>its not binding upon  me</i>" - meaning that when a Scholar has refuted a deviant with clear evidences and proof and the matter is as clear as night and day, "<i>its not binding upon me</i>" - another way to undermine what the Scholars stand to perform of defending the Sunnah and clearing out the deviants. When you look at the da'wah of <a href='../tags/al-halabi.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Halabi</font></a>, you see his real intent behind these principle, they are to defend bid'ah and its people and justify continued cooperation with them - for whatever personal, financial or da'wah based interests are at stake.  </blockquote>    <P>
<b>Now what was the aim in this little history lesson?</b>     <P>
The aim was to show that there is a certain orientation and perspective (which we call "<b>Bannaawitude</b>") which is from the poison of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen. That there are certain <u>individuals</u> and <u>organizations</u> which are carriers of this poison, and they have sophisticated innovated principles which are alluring and beautified, but which they intend misguidance and draw people into their higher goals and agendas. From such individuals are <u>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</u>, and his students such as <u>Adnaan Abd al-Qaadir</u>, and the <u><a href='../tags/jamiyyah-ihyaa-al-turaath.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jam'iyyah Ihyaa al-Turaath</font></a></u> and its sister organizations and various other fronts they use. They often operate in the guise of <i>jamaa'aat khairiyyah</i> (societies to enjoin good) or societies that collect and distribute zakaah and sadaqah. <b>This is what they were doing in the late 1980s and 1990s, tearing Salafi communities apart through the lure of wealth and financing</b>. They no longer operate as "Ihyaa al-Turaath" because that organizations has been largely exposed. But they operate through charity organizations through which they gain control over other mosques and centres and then they start dictating a certain manhaj. It is the manhaj of the Jam'iyyah, the fikr of Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq, it is the twin towers of <b>Ikhwaaniyyah</b> and <b>Turaathiyyah</b>.    <P>
<b>This manhaj requires that your da'wah, your loyalty, your allegiance does not care about distinguishing between truth and falsehood, sunnah and bid'ah, the sunni and the bid'iyy in your da'wah and mu'aamalah (dealings). Rather, you are happy to cooperate with anyone for the purpose of getting as many people as possible within your umbrella, your agenda. This is what Ihyaa al-Turaath was doing in the 1990s and this is what its sister organizations are doing today in the form of charity organizations. They come with the money to mosques and centres to promote "social unity" (another way to describe the manhaj of Hasan al-Banna), the administrations lap up the money, and then we see the Ikhwani, tamyee'ee da'wah emerging from such mosques and centres, where the primary aim has become social solidarity instead of proclaiming the truth and uniting people around it.</b>    <P>
These people have been making inroads into the da'wah scene in the UK from the mid 1990s, and this manhaj has in fact been operative in the MJAH-GLM complex for a very long time. Today's revelation indicates a culmination of their efforts. We shall elaborate on this further in the article inshaa'Allaah.  </blockquote></b></div>    <P>

<blockquote>What appears below is going to be hereafter remembered as <b>Green Lane's 9/11</b> - in other words that which brought down the two towers of Turaathiyyah and Ikhwaaniyyah to the ground (conceptually speaking). These towers took around 16 years to construct (largely in stealth) but only <u>an afternoon to demolish</u>.

And Abd al-Qaadir said in a newspaper editorial, with respect to the latest visit by a delegation of the committee to Britain in order to examine the activities of the centre, "We strive to support righteous, humanitarian and voluntary da'wah work outside of Kuwait <u>in order to build and strengthen the foundations of social solidarity between Muslims</u> whilst noting that "Green Lane Centre" represents a large mosque which comprises an educational, religious and health centre for Muslim youth who are residents in the city of Birmingham" ...    <P>

This newspaper article reveals that there is (and has always been) a tight connection between <b>MJAH-GLM</b> - one that has often been denied over many years. This connection is not just financial. It is also one of methodology (manhaj) as well. The recent <b>MJAH-GLM</b> conference fiasco discussed in previous articles (see   <a href=../index33f1.html?eorot>here</a>, <a href=../indexb0e1.html?cnejc>here</a>, <a href=../index8121.html?amorz>here</a>, <a href=../index2743.html?mjghq>here</a> and <a href=../index5e50.html?vmelv>here</a>) is connected to this matter. <b>MJAH-GLM</b> have always been upon this manhaj and this includes all factions that make up the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> nexus, the <u>al-Hidaayah</u> faction (who are business people) and the mullah section including <u><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></u>, <u>Abdul-Hadi Omari</u>, and the mouthpiece faction, <u><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></u>. This connection helps to explain the direction these people have been taking more openly over the past year or two, which has culminated in them inviting Qutbis, Ikhwanis like <u>Waleed Basyouni</u> and <u>Tawfique Chowdhary</u> to their recent conference.  </blockquote>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Observations and Notes</font>    <P>
<blockquote><ol style="padding-left:0;">  <li>In 1997 when the da'wah of <b>Ikhwaan</b> and <b>Turaath</b> was made clear (largely through the efforts and writings of Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee), in the da'wah scene in the UK numerous individuals and organizations betrayed their Salafi brothers and chose to remain conducting their da'wah upon the Ikhwani, Turathi principles that were the cause of confusion and lack of clarity  prior to that time. They include <b>al-Hidaayah</b> (Na'eem and Sa'eed), the <b>Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeet</b>h figureheads including <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b> and <b>Abdul-Hadi Omari</b>, and individuals such as <b><a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a></b>.    <P>
<li> As a result of this betrayal, these people actively worked against those who held fast to the Salafi creed and methodology, who made walaa and baraa around it, and conducted their da'wah upon clarity, seeking uniting the people around it. These Salafis became objects of the numerous wars and battles that were waged by those remaining upon that <u>Turaathi, Ikhwaani da'wah</u>, along with its associated principles and foundations in behaviour and allegiances.    <P>
<li> It is <u>false</u> and <u>a mistake</u> to try to distinguish between the <b>al-Hidaayah</b> faction and the  Mullah faction consisting of <b><a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a></b>, <b>Abdul-Hadi Omari</b>,  <b>Shu'ayb Mirpuri</b> and others. They are all upon the same manhaj. Just because Na'eem and Sa'eed (al-Hidaayah, current GLM admin) are running the show now, does not mean they alone can be blamed and scapegoated for what has happened in the recent September conference of inviting dubious, astray individuals to speak on their platforms. Rather, all of them have been upon this manhaj in what has passed. In this <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-abdalhadi-conf-taw.jpg>specimen</a></b> we see <b>Abdul-Hadi Omari</b> (the <u>ameer</u> of Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth) - in this September conference during the weekend just passed - sat next to the "innovator" Tawfique Chaudhury who put his name to a Sufi pledge initiative along with grave worshippers and Jahmites. He is second from the right, with Tawfique Chaudhury on the far right. This is because Abdul-Hadi Omari has been upon this manhaj himself, it shows that he hasn't really changed from the days he made his remark, "<i>Also, Ahmad Reza Khan from the Brelwee school of thought, who was a great scholar of the religion who has written many books</i>", praising a caller to Shirk. So the point here is that it is false to distinguish between <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a> (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006a.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006b.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-muhd-adam-kawtharee-s-hasan.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>specimen</a></b>) and Abdul-Hadi Omari on the one hand who represent the Ahl al-Hadeeth and al-Hidaayah (or other factions) on the other hand who have a hold in the <b>MJAH-GLM</b> nexus. All of them have been upon that Ikhwani, Turathi manhaj in da'wah.    <P>
<li>The <b>Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth</b> and <b><a href='../tags/green-lane-mosque.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Green Lane Mosque</font></a></b> complex have been upon the manhaj of Ihyaa al-Turaath and Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq since the 1990s. They have revealed this on numerous occasions, such as what they wrote in a publication in 1999 indicating whom they consider to be scholars (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-calltoallah-scholars.gif>specimen</a></b>). Here they put the heads of the Ikhwan and other deviants alongside the Imaams of <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>. Further, they also explicitly state that their manhaj and the manhaj of Ihyaat al-Turaath is the one and the same and there is cooperation between them (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-AH_FurqanIhyaTurath.jpg>specimen</a></b>). In this article in al-Furqan magazine (no. 107, twelve years ago), we see one of the figureheads of Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth state about Markaz Jam'iyyah Ahl al-Hadeeth and Ihyaa al-Turaath, "<i>Yes, there is cooperation between us, rather it is obligatory upon us to make cooperation because our manhaj is one</i>..."    <P>
<li> Since the late 1990s Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> took a clear, firm and unwavering stance with respect to Turaath and after discussions and advice with individuals (including <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>, <a href='../tags/abu-usamah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah</font></a>, al-Hidaayah) where it became clear these people have agendas and goals and are not willing to make their walaa and baraa around and upon clarity, they began to warn against cooperation with these people, because these people are upon a wishy-washy, murky da'wah in which light is not clear from darkness. Just ask yourself, how does this look: (<b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006a.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-2006b.jpg>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-didsbury-writeup-st.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-muhd-adam-kawtharee-s-hasan.gif>specimen</a></b>, <b><a href=../assets/images/glmgroup-suh-kawthary-suhaib.gif>specimen</a></b>). Do those specimens give you the vision of a bright joyful summer's day or a misty, foggy, depressing, dark winter evening? You be the judge, but just be honest and truthful and throw away any hawaa (bias) that you might have. The point here is that Maktabah <a href='../tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> took a consistent stance because it was clear these people are betrayers and they are betraying a large community in Birmingham (meaning those attending the Green Lane Mosque) which understands and recognizes the obligation and necessity of following the way of Salaf, in principle at least, but who were and are hindered, and involved in psychological games, and kept in the snares of these treacherous, cowardly people such as al-Hidaayah, <a href='../tags/suhaib-hasan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Suhaib Hasan</font></a>, Abdul-Hadi Omari, <a href='../tags/abu-usamah-khaleefah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu Usamah Khaleefah</font></a> and their likes, who are happy to bring Ikhwanis and Qutbis like Waleed Basyouni and Tawfique Chowdhary (who are upon the manhaj of Ali al-Timimi) and put them in front of that community. This is betrayal and deception. All of this has become clear through the fiasco of the September 6th-8th conference.   </ol>    <P>
