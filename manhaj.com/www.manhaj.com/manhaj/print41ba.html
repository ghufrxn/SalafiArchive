<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. These examples were compiled by Abdullah bin Qasim al-Madkhali.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Another one of the followers of al-Hajuri stated:    <P>
<blockquote><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1578;&#1585;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1608;&#1575;&#1601;&#1604; &#1606;&#1581;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1575;&#1585; &#1602;&#1575;&#1583;&#1605;&#1577; &#1603;&#1571;&#1606;&#1607;&#1575; &#1605;&#1603;&#1577; &#1578;&#1602;&#1601;&#1608;&#1575; &#1604;&#1607;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1610;&#1585;  &#1608;&#1602;&#1583; &#1571;&#1581;&#1575;&#1591;&#1608;&#1575; &#1576;&#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1609; &#1601;&#1610; &#1605;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1607; &#1603;&#1605;&#1575; &#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1591; &#1576;&#1576;&#1610;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1593;&#1576;&#1577;   &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1608;&#1585;</span>    <P>
You see the caravans (of people) approaching the abode (<a href='tags/dammaaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dammaaj</font></a>) as if it is Makkah for which the caravans stop. And they encircle Yahya in his sittings just as the circles (of people) encircle the Ka'bah.  </blockquote>    <P>
Here <a href='tags/dammaaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dammaaj</font></a> is treated like the city of Makkah and Yahya al-Haddaadi is treated like the Ka'bah around which the people form circles. This is like or exceeds the way of the Soofees whose praises are nothing to do with the truth and defence of it, but to raise and praise their figureheads in falsehood. Whilst the Soofees have doctrines from which the likes of these statements of exaggeration might arise (so we can understand why they say what they say), what excuse does one who ascribes to knowledge (Yahya al-Haddadi) have in providing a certain type of tarbiyah to his students and followers leading to the likes of these vile statements?   <P>
