<p><div class='sidebar'> <b><u>Excerpt</u>:</b>...In a video published on Youtube on 28 March 2019, this individual repeated these slanders and labels of J&#257;miyyah and Madkhaliyyah against Salafis and he accused them of being Kh&#257;rijites and Murji&#702;ites in certain respects. In the same video he told numerous lies, and there are a lot more lies, statements of deviation, and innovation in his other videos too. It is important that we address some of his speech as mercy to him and to his followers and with the hope that the burden of sin in misinforming and deceiving 72,000 people who have watched his video may be lifted off his back, and that he may recant, repent and apologise for his lies and slanders.    <b><a href=assets/docs/abushamma-slanders.pdf>Download full article: PDF (20 pages)</a></b>  </div>    <P>
