<div class='sidebar'> <font class='titleHeadline'>Introduction</font>    <P>
<blockquote>In the early to mid-20th century, the <u>theological descendants</u> (Hassan al-Bannaa, Sayyid Qutb, Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani) of the heretical kalaam <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> of the 2nd to 5th centuries hijrah - (namely the Ahl al-Kalaam from the Jahmiyyah, Mu'tazilah and Ash'ariyyah who brought the poison of kalaam [taken from the conceptual tools of the Greek Philosophers] into the Ummah) -  they brought the poison of <u>the fikr of secular atheist Jews</u> into the Ummah, namely the "revolution" and "social justice" of the Marxists, Communists, Socialists which gave birth to the innovated concept of the "Islamic political jamaa'ah". Their aim as they claimed was to restore the Islamic rule. In reality, they were largely grieved by the demise of the Sufi, Ash'ari, Maturidi Ottoman empire and they did not affirm the Islaam of the state founded upon the Tawheed of the Messengers and the Salafi aqidah that was at their doorstep, namely Saudi Arabia. They considered all Muslim societies to be societies of disbelief and apostasy. A large part of the impetus behind this activity of theirs was their grievance at the demise of the As'hari,  Maturidi, Soofee state, intense hatred of the Salafi aqidah and manhaj and a desire to restore a state founded up the creed of the Jahmite Ash'aris and Maturidis.     <P>
The theoretical figureheads of this new poison of fikr were the likes of Hassan al-Bannaa, Sayyid Qutb, Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani and Abu A'laa al-Mawdudi. Part of their socialist, communist agenda clothed in the garb of Islaam is to amass the people, ideologically and physically, and mobilize them towards a revolution in order to take power. To this end they innovated many great and evil principles to facilitate their objectives, the aim of which was to silence the People of the Sunnah from speaking the truth, and to allow differences in aqidah to be ignored so as to bring together large numbers people to support the goals of these innovated political <a href='tags/jamaaaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>jamaa'aat</font></a>. The first great <u>taaghoot</u> given birth by this Socialist, Communist, Marxist fikr was the principle of <a href='tags/hasan-al-banna.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hasan al-Banna</font></a>, called their "<i>Golden Principle</i>", "<i>Let us cooperate in that which we agree and pardon each other in that which we disagree</i>." This abolished the firmly founded foundation in the Sunnah of abandoning innovation and its people, refuting them and warning the Ummah from them, because they are from the greatest of harms to this Ummah, its <a href='tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a> and its success. Those who later inherited the teachings of these <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> began to elaborate on this principle and reformulate it in a variety of different ways in order to make inroads into Salafi audiences. From the heads of innovation bringing this <u>Marxist, Socialist, Communist originating filth and corruption</u> into the deen of Allaah (disguised under lofty and alluring slogans) were the following:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>Abdur-Rahmaan Abdul-Khaaliq</b>, who claimed multiplicity of <a href='tags/groups.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>groups</font></a> is virtuous and good for da'wah, he innovated a fourth category for <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, he reviled and slandered the Major Scholars of the Sunnah (calling them mummified bodies of a long-gone age). He combined between the fikr of Sayyid Qutb and Hassan al-Bannaa and repackaged it for a Salafi audience.    <P>
<li> <b><a href='tags/salman-al-awdah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salman al-Awdah</font></a></b>, another heretical diseased innovator. He tried to include the various <a href='tags/sects.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>sects</font></a> such as the Ikhwan, Tabligh and Tahrir within the saved sect (al-firqah al-najiyah). Currently, he has opened arms to the Sufis, Shi'ites and Liberalists. This is part of the current Ikhwani agenda for the 21st century as outlined by one of their main theoreticians Abdullaah al-Nafeesee (al-Kuwaitee) in the book "<i>Ru'yah Mustaqbalah</i>." Namely, that the goal cannot be achieved except with cooperation with the Shi'ah, the Liberalists, Marxists and Communists.    <P>
<li> <b>Adnaan Ar'oor</b> who also combined between the fikr of Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb and tried to bring it into a Salafi audience. He spoke of the bid'ah of al-Muwaazanah and numerous offshoot principles from Hassan al-Bannaa's original taaghootee principle.    <P>
<li> <b><a href='tags/abu-al-hasan-al-maribee.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribee</font></a></b> who followed on the work of those who preceded him and he thought that his planned revolution against the Salafi  manhaj and its people following the death of the four great Scholars of our era (Shaykhs Ibn Baz, <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, Ibn Uthaymeen, Muqbil) would be successful. The heretical mubtadi' was unfortunately mistaken.  </ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
The Scholars of the Sunnah stood to repel this onslaught and at the head of them was <b>Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</b> who played an instrumental role in exposing them and making clear their evil designs and their opposition to the deen of Allaah, the Exalted, and their enmity and opposition to the Salafi aqidah. He was supported by the other Major Scholars in all the major issues of aqidah and  manhaj with respect to which he refuted those heretical <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a>, their institutions, parties and organizations. </div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> Refuting Adnaan Ar'oor's Principle and Making Tahdheer (Warning) From Him</font>    <P>
The audio for what follows below can be found here: <b>Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> on the Ar'oori Principles</b> (<a href=http://www.sunnahpublishing.net/audio/fawzanarur.wma>Download here </a>) - courtesy of SunnahPublishing.Net. This phone conversation was also printed in the book "<i>Tahdheer ul-Anaam min Akhtaa' Ahmad Sallaam</i>"    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><b>Note:</b> This is reproduction of material that was published 10 years ago on Spubs.Com</div>    <P>
<blockquote><u>Question:</u> We want to present some principles to you, and we require some clarification by the answers, and whether they are in agreement with what Ahl us-Sunnah are upon of firmly established usool (foundations)?    <P>
1. "We correct (the mistake) but we do not disparage (the person, i.e. make jarh)."    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "This a false principle (qaa'idah baatilah), which has no basis for it. It is binding to make jarh (criticise, censure) the people of falsehood."    <P>
2. "When you judge (upon someone), you are judged upon, and when you invite (him instead), then you are rewarded"    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "This is a newly introduced matter which has no basis for it. It is necessary to pass judgement over Ahl ul-Bid'ah."    <P>
3. It is from justice and equity to mention both the good and evil points, and he used as an argument for the manhaj of al-Muwaazanah with the well-known hadeeth, "he spoke the truth but he is a great liar" (concerning the devil that taught aayat ul-kursee to Abu Hurairah).    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "This is false speech also, for the Qur'aan mentions the evils of the Mushrikeen and it does not mention their good deeds. And Ahl ul-Bidah are treated like that also. That which is mentioned is his evil. His good deeds are not to be mentioned, because Allaah mentioned the evil of the enemies and He did not mention their good aspects."    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "Are these the principles of Ar'oor?"    <P>
<u>Questioner:</u> "Yes".    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "These are principles that are criticised and which are false, and which are rejected upon him, and books have actually been written against him."    <P>
4. "It is permissible to declare someone to be in error, but reviling is forbidden".    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "This (principle) is similar to "We correct (the mistake), but we do not criticise (the person)", it is the same principle."    <P>
<u>Question:</u> "[Adnaan Ar'oor] said, "Why is Imaam Ahmad not reproached for his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of the one who abandons prayer and yet Sayyid Qutb is reproached merely because some of these expressions occurred from him (i.e. his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of Muslim societies). So we say: This one performed <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of the Muslim societies (i.e. Qutb), and yet Imaam Ahmad ý may Allaah have mercy upon him ý is not reproached despite his judgement of kufr against all these societies [meaning that the majority of them do not pray]."    <P>
So what is your comment upon this?"    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "Imaam Ahmad is a scholar and a sage (erudite, sagacious) who knows the evidences and the manner of extracting proof from them and Sayyid Qutb is an ignoramus (jaahil) who has no knowledge or cognisance and neither does he have any evidences for what he says. Hence, equating between Imaam Ahmad and Sayyid Qutb is injustice (dhulm) [because Imaam Ahmad has many evidences from the Book and the Sunnah for the one who deliberately abandons the prayer whereas Sayyid does not have a single piece of evidence for his <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of the Muslims in general. Rather the evidences are in opposition to what he says]."    <P>
<u>Question:</u> "Likewise he (Adnaan Ar'oor) says, "I do not know of anyone who has spoken about the affairs of Manhaj in the manner that Sayyid Qutb has spoken of them. And he is correct in the vast majority of what he has written." He (Ar'oor) was asked about this statement of his and he replied, "By the word minhaaj here I mean the issues of reform, elections and assassinations. And by "in his time" I mean the Fifties."    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "He (Ar'oor) does not know because he is ignorant. As for us, then we know ý and all praise is due to Allaah ý that the scholars both prior to and after Sayyid Qutb, opposed him."    <P>
<u>Question:</u> "Adnaan says, "There is a trap in the name of da'wah to the manhaj of Ahl us-Sunnah, and to disparage the servants and to revile the servants on account of a single word or due to an ambiguous expression, and also a trap in the name of <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a>, a trap which is called "takfir of the rulers" .    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "This is meaningless speech, by which beautification of falsehood and defence of Ahl ul-Bid'ah is intended".    <P>
<u>Question:</u> [And his saying] "Whoever follows up all the causes of splitting, will find that the majority of them are to do with manners, and not to do with aqeedah or manhaj."    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "Rather, causes in aqeedah and manners. But he desires to cover and protect them (i.e. the Innovators)".    <P>
<u>Question:</u> "What is your saying concerning him?"    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "He, in his foundation, he is not a scholar. He came to Saudiyyah as a worker (employed), and then he openly manifested what is actually with him (of manhaj)."    <P>
<u>Question:</u> "Are his lessons to be attended or not?"    <P>
<u>Shaykh:</u> "We advise the Salafee youth to cut off from him and not to attend his lessons".</blockquote>    <P>
