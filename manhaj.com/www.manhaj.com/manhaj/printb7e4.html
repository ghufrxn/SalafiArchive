<p><div class='sidebar'>  Mu&#7717;ammad Mun&#299;r is <b>a misguided individual who misguides others</b> and is driven by his <b>narcissism</b> to market himself as a full blown, independent scholar and muft&#299; who does not make taql&#299;d and is not in need of any contemporary scholars. He draws people to himself by self-promotion and away from the way of the Salaf and from the Scholars upon the way of the Salaf... Likewise, Mun&#299;r gives fatw&#257; and answers questions related to manhaj issues in opposition to the answers of the major Salaf&#299; scholars of this era, such as Im&#257;m Ibn Baz, Im&#257;m al-Alb&#257;n&#299;, Im&#257;m Ibn al-&#703;Uthaym&#299;n, Shaykh A&#7717;mad al-Najm&#299;, Shaykh &#7778;&#257;li&#7717; al-Fawz&#257;n, Shaykh Rab&#299;&#703; and others, and has mechanisms through which he justifies his orientation. This article discusses his belittlement of the Salaf (at the head of whom are the Companions) and his rejection of their being <b>a superior understanding which they possessed</b>, which Muslims are obligated to follow as a criterion of truth in creed and methodology. He considers, "<b>The Qur'an, the Sunnah and the Understanding of the Salaf</b>" as a third, foreign, exotic way that does not exist.     <P>
