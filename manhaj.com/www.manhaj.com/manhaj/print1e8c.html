<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>In this series of articles we present the statements of the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah which clarify and explain the issue of (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1584;&#1585; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1607;&#1604;</span>), the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a>, and also (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1593;&#1604;&#1608;&#1605; &#1605;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606; &#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1590;&#1585;&#1608;&#1585;&#1577;</span>), that which is known from the religion by necessity. There is much confusion and speculation about this issue, despite the fact that it is very clear in the speech of the Scholars. One should also be aware of factions of the <b>Takfiris, Qutbis</b> who allege that the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah such as Imaam Ibn Baz, Imaam <a href='tags/ibn-uthaymin.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ibn Uthaymin</font></a>, Imaam al-Albaani, Shaykh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbaad and many other contemporary Scholars are "revisionists," a charge levelled because these Scholars did not agree to their methodologies and positions (of mass <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of nations and societies or <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of certain rulers). Hence, they extended this claim of revisionism beyond the issue of the <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of the rulers into other issues (such as the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> and that which is known from the religion by necessity) in order to discredit these Scholars and make the people not take from them and instead to drive the people towards the Harakiyyeen and their figureheads. These Qutbis and Takfiris are ignorant people, they are pretenders to knowledge, and they employ much deception. Instead of being honest and saying that difference in this issue can be found right through the history of the da'wah of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> in Najd, and varying sayings can be found amongst the Scholars of the da'wah, they opted for their usual trait of deception and lies and tried to attack those Scholars who spoke against their Qutbi da'wah by accusing them of being "revisionists" merely because they held the view of granting the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> in matters of kufr and shirk within certain circumstances. Addressing their falsehood and their conniving in detail is for another place. Here we want to systematically document the sayings of the scholars for the purposes of building a record and at a later time, we will inshaa'Allaah, discuss some of these issues with the purpose of clarification.</blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan's Comment on Shaykh Rabee Regarding  Those Falling into Shirk From the Ignorant Muslims</font>    <P>
Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> reviewed the book of Shaykh Rabee', "<i>Manhaj al-Anbiyaa Fee al-Da'wah Ilallaah</i>" and made a remark upon a statement of Shaykh Rabee' where he was speaking about ignorant people falling into Shirk (such as in places like India), having been affected by the Mushriks. Here is the page:    <P>
<img src=assets/images/takfir-excuse-fawzan-rabee.jpg width="525" border="1" border=0>    <P>
Shaykh Rabee explains that in these lands (where many of these politicians emerge with their political da'wah) the people are steeped in Shirk, and the majority of the Muslims are far away from understanding Islam and Tawheed. That they are affected in their beliefs by the mushriks whom they have been living with, and you will see Muslims, just like the mushriks in their lands, having their own idols (tombs), covered in silk, decorated with flowers and burning incense, flocking around it with humility, awe, veneration, alongside their belief that the Awliyaa know the unseen and control the creation. Upon this Shaykh Saalih <a href='tags/al-fawzaan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzaan</font></a> commented:    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Whoever does this is not to be labelled a Muslim unless when he does this out of ignorance and the proof has not been established against him.</blockquote>    <P>
The Shaykh does have other speech that suggests the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> does not apply (in matters treated as "known by necessity" or "through conveyance of the Qur'an" etc.), however the intent here is to show that this view has been held by the Shaykh (and that there is differing about it between the Scholars) and this is a silencing of the <b><a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a></b> who are using this issue to ascribe Irjaa' to many of the Salafi Scholars who affirm the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a>  and they include Scholars of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> from Najd in what has passed and likewise the contemporary Scholars, <a href='tags/al-albani.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Albani</font></a>, Ibn al-Uthaymin, Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad and so on.     <P>
These <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a> have now openly started speaking against Scholars such Ibn Taymiyyah, Abd al-Razzaaq al-Afeefee, Ibn Baz in whose statements there can be found what amounts to the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> for those falling into Shirk.    <P>
