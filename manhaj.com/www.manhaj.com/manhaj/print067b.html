<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. When it is the case that the Messenger of Allaah, (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and the Companions (radiallaahu anhu) are not free from the tongue of <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, then it is unlikely that his followers will have any shame in attacking those less than them, the Scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah.    <P>
Shaykh Rabee' bin Haadee established that al-Hajooree is a Haddaadi but continued to show lenience and gentleness with al-Hajooree, hoping that he would return and recant - unfortunately that has not happened and the Shaykh has recently warned about the fitnah of al-Hajuri.    <P>
The audio below is a recording from 1st Jumaadah al-Oulaa 1434H and the essential points have been summarized. This was put out by our brothers from <a href=http://sunnahpublishing.net/>Sunnah Publishing</a> and we have added some additional points from the audio not in the original.    <P>
</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Rabee on the Fitnah of <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a> and His IgnorantFollowers</font>    <P>
Listen to the audio here:    <P>

<b>Essential Points</b>    <P>
<blockquote>     Concerning the view of Yahyaa al-Hajooree and his followers, the Shaykh explained that their behaviour is essentially saying the following, that "<i>All of the Salafiyyeen are <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> now all of them are <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> now.  The callers and the Scholars, all of them are beneath his (al-Hajuri's) feet now</i>."    <P>
  Concerning the followers of Yahyaa al-Hajooree, the Shaykh said, "<i>Complaints have come to us from all regions of the earth.  Perhaps an individual learns for two days, three months, two months and then he goes far away, to Russia saying, 'Ubayd, Ubayd, Yahyaa.  Yahyaa is above the heavens and Ubayd is an innovator. This is their da'wah.  Britain, Sudan, <a href='tags/egypt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Egypt</font></a>, Turkey, Kenya, Libya, all of the nations are loaded with hatred against the Salafiyyeen and <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a>, (this is) a war which has no equal to it</i>."    <P>
   Shaykh Rabee' said, "<i>We have remained patient for seven years, whilst letters and complaints were coming to us</i>."    <P>
  When a students says, "Advise him, O Shaykh, and write him a letter," Shaykh Rabee' replies, "<i>I have already advised him, and I have advised him, and I have advised him, and I have advised him concerning what he has.  And at times the advice would go on for two and a half hours.  And he would not listen and he would return and he would not have fulfilled his share, may Allaah bless you.  And his students are extremists (<a href='tags/ghulaat.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghulaat</font></a>), with extremism that has no match.  Meaning, imaamuth-thaqalayn (Imaam of mankind and the Jinn) and an-naasihul-ameen (trustworthy advisor) extremism and extremism and extremism</i>."    <P>
   Shaykh Rabee' says to the student, "<i>Go to him and advise him.  Do not campaign for him and do not applaud him and take positions as men with regards to him</i>."    <P>
 Shaykh Rabee' said about al-Hajuri (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1571;&#1614;&#1590;&#1614;&#1585;&#1617; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575;&#1587; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1614;&#1617;&#1593;&#1618;&#1600;&#1608;&#1614;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1604;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1548; &#1604;&#1575;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1581;&#1614;&#1583; &#1571;&#1614;&#1590;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1617; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1609;</span>), "<i>The most harmful of people to the Salafi Da'wah, there is no one more harmful than Yahyaa</i>."    <P>
 Shaykh Rabee' said, "<i>My brother, we have schools... many thousands, all of them are upon the Salafi manhaj, they call to Salafiyyyah and they defend it, (yet) they are all under the feet (according to al-Hajuri and followers). (Such schools are in) the Kingdom, in <a href='tags/yemen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yemen</font></a>, in Algeria, in all of the countries, (but) everything is under the feet</i>."    <P>
 Shaykh Rabee' said, (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1607;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1605;&#1575;&#1607;&#1610; &#1587;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1548; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618;&#1607;&#1614;&#1580; &#1587;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610;</span>), "<i>This is not <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> and nor is it the Salafi manhaj</i>."  </ul>  </blockquote>    <P>
