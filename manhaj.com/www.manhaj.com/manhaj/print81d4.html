<p><div align="right"><img src=assets/images/al-hamd-salat.gif border=0></div>    <P>
<div class='sidebar'> In previous articles we highlighted the following:     <P>
<ul> <li> <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> belittling the rububiyyah of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic (see <a href=indexe56b.html?gkmnd>here</a>) and speaking with Mu'tazili Qadari poison.  <li> Shadeed Muhammad's belittlement of the affair of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> (see   <a href=index85b5.html?qwsvz>here</a>).  <li> <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> using a degrading label for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) such as "alpha male" and then defending it after it was made clear to him that this is unfitting and is the way of the disbelievers who use it to refer to him as a sex-seeking, power-hungry, warmonger (see   <a href=index0e4a.html?mfzfe>here</a> and <a href=indexb689.html?vuuma>here</a>).  <li> Shadeed Muhammad's lies upon Aa'ishah (radiyallaahu anhaa) that she marched/demonstrated against Ali (radiyallaahu anhu) (see   <a href=indexf7f9.html?gzccw>here</a>).  <li> Shadeed Muhammad's corruption in walaa and baraa in that he is angered that a white man should refute the 'Nation of Islam' in matters of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a>, Imaan (see   <a href=indexf3dc.html?iryyv>here</a>) and demands  that he be more concerned instead with "white privelege" and "police brutality".  <li> Munir Muhammad regurgitating the arguments of Ikhwanis in relation to innovation, <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> and disparagement and warning (see   <a href=index13b0.html?utjea>here</a>, <a href=index0090.html?odviu>here</a>).  <li> Errors in da'wah and methodology allowing Baatinee Kafirs to gain tactical benefit and call to their zandaqah (see   <a href=index2836.html?nrnfu>here</a>) in the case of <a href='tags/tahir-wyatt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tahir Wyatt</font></a>.  </ul>    <P>
All of these are knowledge and da'wah based issues and are serious and dangerous.     <P>
<b>NOTE: This article highlights <u>the depths of ignorance</u> of <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> which leads him to make terrible statements in matters of deen. Being generous, we excuse him for his ignorance, despite the fact that he compiled a book on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> back in 2009 and spent six years at the Islamic University of Madinah. Nowhere in this article do we make takfeer of Shadeed, but we simply highlight the very dangerous statements that emanate from him and also the corruption in his da'wah and its direction. All of this indicates jahl of a tremendous nature.</b>  </div>    <P>
<blockquote>    <P>
We were sent a clip from a lecture given by <a href='tags/shadeed-muhammad.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Shadeed Muhammad</font></a> On 29th September 2017 related to social responsibilities of the Muslim community. Within this clip, Shadeed expresses a statement in which there is a validation of the deen of the Ahl al-Kitab and Mushrikeen. He asserts that it maybe the case that (non Muslims and other faith traditions (which means Ahl al-Kitab and Mushrikeen) are closer to Allaah due to their devotion, worship and service to humanity than many Muslims (who are people of Tawhid).    <P>
Listen to the audio: (<a href=assets/audio/shadeed-nm-worship-closer-clip.mp3>MP3 file</a>).    <P>
<audio controls>  <source src="assets/audio/shadeed-nm-worship-closer-clip.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">  Your browser does not support the audio element.  </audio>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>So how much are we really isolating ourselves as a Muslim community. We talk the talk but we don't really walk the walk. We talk, you know the Islamic community, but the fact of the matter is that the lines have been blurred between the Islamic community and the non-Islamic community, evidenced by how we carry ourselves. And that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, because not all non-Muslims or not other faith-traditions are immoral and sacriligious as we would like to paint them to be.<b> As a matter of fact, some of them might be, you know, closer to God in terms of their worship, in terms of their religious devotion, in terms of their service to humanity than many of us as Muslims</b>. </blockquote>    <P>
If we were to render this in Arabic as close as possible, it could be as follows:    <P>
<div class='arabic' dir='rtl' align='right'>&#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1575;&#1602;&#1593;&#1548; &#1602;&#1583; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1593;&#1590; &#1605;&#1606;&#1607;&#1605;&#1548; &#1603;&#1605;&#1575; &#1578;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1608;&#1606;&#1548; &#1571;&#1602;&#1585;&#1576; &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1606; &#1581;&#1610;&#1579; &#1593;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1578;&#1607;&#1605;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606; &#1581;&#1610;&#1579; &#1578;&#1583;&#1610;&#1606;&#1607;&#1605;&#1548; &#1605;&#1606; &#1581;&#1610;&#1579; &#1582;&#1583;&#1605;&#1578;&#1607;&#1605; &#1604;&#1604;&#1576;&#1588;&#1585;&#1610;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1603;&#1579;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1606;&#1575; &#1603;&#1605;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1606;.</div>    <P>
Upon this are some observations:    <P>
<ol><li> The statement under question, which has been highlighted, is <b>a standalone statement</b>, comprising a complete meaning in and of itself. It does not require anything before it or after it (and we have listened to that) for it to be understood, or for it to be given a context that would alter its substance. It is a complete meaning in and of itself.     <P>
<li> In this statement Shadeed is asserting that it might be the case that the Ahl al-Kitab and Mushrikeen (they are the only two categories that exist besides the Muslims) are closer to Allaah in terms of their worship (ibaadah) and religious devotion and service to humanity than many Muslims. Within this is a validation of the deen of Ahl al-Kitab and Mushrikeen as an acceptable religion. Now, these are the implications of Shadeed's words and out of justice, we will not say that he is intending, deliberately to validate these adyaan. Rather, we say he is an ignoramus who, due to his jahl, does not know what he is saying. He often gets caught in the emotion of the particular thought he is getting across and will insert another statement or a thought without really thinking about it, and make terrible mistakes in the process (like he did  <a href=indexe56b.html?gkmnd>here</a>, speaking ill of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic). Nevertheless, despite giving him that excuse, this does not mean that we let this baatil (falsehood) pass untouched. His speech is baatil (falsehood) and kufr (disbelief), without that necessitating that we have passed judgement upon him. We excuse him with jahl (ignorance) and khata' (error) - unless he persists in defending this statement after its falsehood has been made clear.    <P>
<li> From the nawaaqid of Islam is to validate the deen of the mushrikeen by considering their way (madhhab) to be valid.    <P>
<div class='arabic' dir='rtl' align='right'> &#1605;&#1606; &#1604;&#1605; &#1610;&#1603;&#1601;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1588;&#1585;&#1603;&#1610;&#1606;&#1548; &#1571;&#1608;&#1588;&#1603; &#1601;&#1610; &#1603;&#1601;&#1585;&#1607;&#1605;&#1548; &#1571;&#1608; &#1589;&#1581;&#1581; &#1605;&#1584;&#1607;&#1576;&#1607;&#1605;. &#1603;&#1601;&#1585; &#1573;&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1593;&#1575;&#1611;</div>    <P>
<li> To say that Ahl al-Kitab and Mushrikeen are "<i>closer to Allaah</i>" in terms of their "<i>worship and religious devotion</i>" than many of the Muslims is <b>a validation of their worship and devotion</b>. Whereas the Qur'an in many places (beginning of Surah al-Ghaashiyah, Surah al-Bayyinah, 25:23) falsifies this worship. This is not acceptable worship, but futile worship, and no one is "close" to Allaah with futile worship resting upon a deen of kufr that is mubaddal and muharraf.    <P>
<li> To say therefore that maybe a mushrik is closer to Allaah in terms of worship and religious devotion than a muwahhid upon Islam, irrespective of his sin and disobedience, then this is a statement of kufr. Shadeed must recant from this statement, make tawbah to Allaah.     <P>
<li> It would not have been a problem if Shadeed said: "Some of the non-Muslims and faith traditions have a greater amount of devotion to their religion (and to their deities) than many of us do as Muslims to our religion and to Allah" - this meaning, there is nothing wrong with it, it is saying something that would be factual and true. But as for saying they are "closer to Allaah" on account of their "worship and devotion" then this is baatil and it is a statement that contains validation of their religion.  </ol>    <P>
This matter is simple enough for any person of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> to understand and does not require any further comment. It does not require any detailed <a href='tags/refutations.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>refutations</font></a> or citing of lots of texts as any child who has been taught the basics of <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> and Islam knows of its futility. Shadeed is a graduate of the Islamic University of Madinah and has even compiled a book on <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> taken from the writings of the A'immat al-Da'wah. This shows that tawfeeq is purely from Allaah and certificates are not a proof in and of themselves that a person has actual fiqh in the religion.     <P>
<div class='sidebar'>All of our speech against the likes of Shadeed (and others) are regarding the foundations of the religion, in creed or methodology. We have no interest or concern about anything else walhamdulillaah. We do not have any personal grievances with these people and nor have they harmed us in the dunya or anything of  that nature such that there should be any grievances.  It is the way of the people of baatil and hawaa in that when there is a legitimate, warranted criticism, then they start making unfounded accusations (of control, monopoly, power, cultism and so on) built upon lies and suspicions and they spread slanders and develop personal vendettas because they got angry for their own nafs and not for the sake of Allaah. This is because they are unable to respond to these criticisms and if they do, it is with flowery speech and deception to explain away their mistakes, rather than to acknowledge them and take them back.     <P>
<b>Finally:</b> It should be known that it angers us more that these people utter these statements of falsehood about Allaah's deen--statements that relate to the very foundations of the deen--than it angers us that they slander us, attempt to defame us and bring us down using the most despicable of ways! Meanwhile, it angers them more that Shadeed is criticised than it angers them that Shadeed disrespects Allaah, disrespects the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), lies upon Aa'ishah and the Companions (radiyallaahu anhum) and so on. Let them continue in their path and we will continue in our path seeking the aid and assistance of Allaah, asking him to make us sincere in all that we do and for His sake alone, Ameen.   </div>    <P>
