<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The following is a serialization in parts of an article written by Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee in exposing the misguidance of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi. You can refer to the original Arabic <a href=http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?t=46986>posted here</a>. Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee was a student of Shaykh Muqbil and also spent time studying with Yahya al-Haddadi. He has a number of very good articles which give a great deal of context and background to the deviation of al-Hajuri, many of these things are not revealed to those in the West and it will be very eye-opening inshaa'Allaah. Meanwhile the fanatics of al-Hajuri continue their futile defence of their Imaam and continue attacking those who are with the firmly-grounded Scholars such as Shaykh Rabee', Shaykh Ubayd, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee and others. One should also note that there is no one with al-Hajuri except the youths and youngsters he is propping up as "Shaykhs" to make it look to everyone that there are lots of "Shaykhs" with him. There aren't. He is on his own with "thousands" of his students now being promoted to shaikhdom in order to give life-support to the corpse of Yahyah al-Haddadi's reputation.</blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Usool of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> Opposed by <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> and Those With Him: Part 1 - Introduction, al-Hajuri is Akhbath (Most Vile) of Diseased Souls in His Manhaj</font>  <blockquote>By Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee (former student of Shaykh Muqbil and of Yahya al-Hajuri)</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>All praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaat, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his companions. To proceed:    <P>
Every time a diseased soul becomes constricted, not being able to abide by the manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah - the blessed Salafi manhaj - and is not able to show patience on the restrictions which the Salafi manhaj is defined by, (such a soul) begins to stir trouble between Ahl al-Sunnah, screaming and stumbling like a possessed person. As a result of this, an observer may start thinking that this is a flaw with the Salafi manhaj but does not know that this disturbance is in fact from these diseased souls. Just like a sick man who has been touched (by Jinn), this remains with him for many years without no one really knowing. Then when he comes (in the presence) of the people of the Qur'an and knows that he will not hear except verses, hadeeth, recitation, tafseer and what is like this, he falls (due to the effect of the possession), requesting that he be taken out from this place. There is no fault in the place (he is present in) rather the fault is with this sick person who is not able to bear presence in this place.    <P>
Indeed, from the likes of such people is al-Hajuri, rather he is the most vile (<i>akhbath</i>) of them in manhaj. He stood to cause trouble for the Scholars of the Salafi da'wah and at the head of them is our Shaykh, Shaykh Rabee. His affair (that of al-Hajuri) is like that of the affair of his predecessors, such as Mahmood al-Haddaad who stormed (into the da'wah) for a period but  the Salafi da'wah spat him out, and his affair and that of his companions came to an end, and the Salafi da'wah remained pure.    <P>
And al-Hajuri has deviant principles which he proceeds upon and his followers proceed upon them, and these foundations took him away from the path of the people of knowledge, so here are some of the foundations which <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> opposed:    <P>
<ul><li> <b>The first:</b> Uniting the word  <li> <b>The second:</b> Loyalty for the generality of Ahl al-Sunnah  <li> <b>The third:</b> Preserving the status of the Scholars  <li> <b>The fourth:</b> Praising the leading Imaams who have preceded  <li> <b>The fifth:</b> Wisdom in the da'wah to Allaah  <li> <b>The sixth:</b> Leaving judgements in tribulations and newly-arising affairs affecting Muslims for the Scholars  <li> <b>The seventh:</b> Having istiqaamah (steadfastness) upon the Sunnah, and being safe from having lots of subsidiary deviations.  </ul>    <P>
So these are seven foundations and perhaps the rest will come after (in order to be addressed). And when his opposition to these foundations were the cause of his deviation and of those who are with him, I wished to explain them so that the readers will come to know of the reasons behind the scholars warning against <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> and whoever is with him.    <P>
Every intelligent and just person knows that the warning of the scholars against <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> and Falih al-Harbee and whoever is like them is an evidence that Ahl al-Sunnah are just and they do not flatter anyone in the deen of Allaah, the Most High, even if it was a man who in the beginning of the affair, affiliated with them, and even if he was a man who ingratiates himself (gains favour) from Ahl al-Sunnah by refuting the people of innovation and partisanship, for they (Ahl al-Sunnah) will not be satisfied with him until he shows steadfastness upon the way.     <P>
So let us know proceed to these foundations...</blockquote> <P>
