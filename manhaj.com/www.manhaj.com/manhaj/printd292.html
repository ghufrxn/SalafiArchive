<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>In a gathering with brothers from the Maldives, Singapore, the UK, India and the US after Isha prayer on 25th Jumadah First 1434H (6th April 2013) Shaykh Ahmad <a href='tags/bazmul.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Bazmul</font></a> (hafidhahullaah) outlined a number of foundations (usool) derived from the Book, the Sunnah and understanding of the Companions which distinguishes the ways of the Mumayyi'ah (Halabiyyah and Ma'ribiyyah) and the <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a> (Hajooriyyah, Hajaawirah) from the way of the people of truth. The amazing, concise talk helped to clarify many of the shubuhaat (doubts) surrounding the way of the people of the Sunnah in adhering to the Scholars who clarify the truth from falsehood and the allegations made against them in this regard.     <P>
The following is an outline translation made during the talk and serves to communicate all the core and essential points made by the Shaykh.</blockquote></div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Part 5: An Important Foundation of the Religion - Acting Upon One's Knowledge and the Meaning of a Sound Heart</font>    <P>
<blockquote>The Shaykh went on to explain a fifth and final foundation (asl) which he stated is very important, and said that he will seal the lesson with and remind himself and those present with it - which is that we should ask ourselves, "Why did Allaah create us?" It is to worship Him alone, and also to know why we have been commanded, it is to know the truth and to follow it and to know falsehood and to avoid it and its people. The intent behind knowledge is to act upon it. Knowing and not acting is harmful knowleldge, it is a loss to that person, when he does not act upon what he knows.    <P>
The Shaykh also explained that the world (dunyaa) is a passing temporary place (daar mamarr), it is a place of action and a place of lots of tribulations. But the Hereafter is a place of settlement and permanence (dar maqarr) and a place of accounting. So we have to have patience upon the truth until we meet Allaah. Wealth and status will not benefit us on the Day of Judgement. "<b>The day on which neither wealth nor offspring will benefit. Except the one who comes to Allaah with a sound heart</b>" (26:88-89).    <P>
The Shaykh explained that a <b>sound heart</b> is one that is nurtured upon the Qur'an, the Sunnah upon the understanding of the Sahaabah. A sound heart is not just one that is free of unbefitting things, (e.g. such as rancour, suspicion and the likes), rather a sound heart is one that is upon the Qur'an, the Sunnah upon the understanding of the Sahaabah.    <P>
The Shaykh finished by supplicating and asking Allaah to "make me and you to benefit through knowledge and righteous action" and to "spare us from the tribulations until we meet him."  </blockquote>    <P>
End of the final part, there were a few very important questions at the end, which are to follow inshaa'Allaah. <P>
