<p><font class='titleHeadline'>Shaykh Salih <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzan</font></a> on <a href='tags/takfir.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>takfir</font></a> of Those Who Worship the Righteous</font>    <P>
May Allaah reward the sister who sent us this audio: <a href=assets/audio/fawzan-shirk-excuse-ignorance.mp3>Download MP3 File</a>. Original is from this lecture (<a href=http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/sites/default/files/fathul majid - 17 - 4-  1437.mp3>Sharh Fath al-Majeed</a>) at 55m:30s, dated 17/04/1437AH (<a href=http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/taxonomy/term/281>see here</a>).    <P>
<blockquote>  <b>Question:</b>  <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>Esteemed Shaykh, this questioner says: The one who went astray in the topic of intercession and worshipped the righteous due to a doubt which occurred to him, can he be prayed over (with the funeral prayer)?</blockquote>    <P>
<b>Answer:</b>   <blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>If he persists upon this after he has been conveyed to and prohibited from that, then prayer is not performed over him. As for when it has not been conveyed to him, then he is prayed over, because the falsehood of what he is upon has not been conveyed to him. Yes, whilst he ascribes to Islam, says "<i>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammad Rasoolullaah</i>", however he fell into what he fell into due to ignorance  (whose nature) has not been explained to him. Yes.</blockquote></blockquote>    <P>
<b>Comment:</b> This is powerful refutation of the misguided, evil <a href='tags/haddaadiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Haddaadiyyah</font></a> who accuse the Salafi scholars of Irjaa' because they afford the <a href='tags/excuse-of-ignorance.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>excuse of ignorance</font></a> in matters of Shirk and claim that to affirm Islaam for a person who falls into Shirk out of ignorance without the proof being established upon him is the religion of al-Jahm bin Safwaan and Daawood bin Jarjees. In the above answer, Shaykh <a href='tags/al-fawzan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Fawzan</font></a> affirms that such a person is prayed over. These people (Haddadis and Takfiri Extremists) employ this issue in which scholars have differences as a means of kindling tribulation and engineering the accusation of al-Irjaa' against Ahl al-Sunnah. For a detailed refutation of these misguided evil <a href='tags/innovators.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Innovators</font></a> which include factions from the followers of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>, refer to <a href=http://alhajuri.com/?swiuidp>this book</a>:    <P>
