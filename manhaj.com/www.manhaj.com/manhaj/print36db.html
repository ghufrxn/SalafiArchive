<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
<blockquote>This weekend (Friday - Sunday 12th - 14th April, 2013), the followers of al-Hajuri in the city of London organized a three day seminar. We have seen despicable examples of <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> (extremism) in previous articles in this series, and our aim in this article is to illustrate another sample of this <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>.  What is laughable is that whilst they protest against the exposition of their <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> towards "his royal highness" (al-Hajuri) and his majestic flesh, they continue to demonstrate this <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> with no shame.    <P>
In the schedule of this conference this weekend, there are 16 lectures running over the three day period. The <u>very last</u> lecture on Sunday (this evening) is stated as follows:    <P>
<blockquote>7:30 - 8:00 Maghrib and break    <P>
"The last thereof will be the smell of musk..." 8:00 - 9:00 tele-link with the esteemed scholar of <a href='tags/yemen.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yemen</font></a> Ashaikh Al'alaama Yahya bin Ali alhajoori.</blockquote>    <P>
The title of this lecture has been carefully chosen and indicates the continuing <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> in the way they perceive and view his royal highness, <a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>majestic of flesh</a>, <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>, <a href=indexac51.html?gxpqv>star of stars</a> and Imaam of Imaams. The title is taken from the verse in Surah al-Mutaffifeen, (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1582;&#1578;&#1575;&#1605;&#1607; &#1605;&#1587;&#1603;</span>), and <u>the thinking</u> here is that we will seal the conference, <b>the last thereof will be the smell of the musk of Paradise</b>, and this is in reference to al-Hajuri, who is sealing the conference by his tele-presence and his speech. The followers of al-Hajuri portray and exemplify al-Hajuri's presence and his speech as the musk of Paradise - not surprising when you consider his <a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>melted flesh</a> would morph into an uncreated attribute of Allaah, in the words of one of them.    <P>
But in contrast, when it comes to the Scholars of the Sunnah, to use a sample from <u>the lexicon of Yahya al-Hajuri</u>, (which is reserved for the Scholars of the Sunnah), one of the Scholars of Madinah, in the view of his royal highness, al-Hajuri, is exemplified as "<i>the fart of an old woman</i>" (this is straight from the mouth of al-Hajuri, and his followers are well aware of this language coming from al-Hajuri).     <P>
<b>If a person pays attention carefully to these people, and looks at their writings, one will see that <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> is a staple diet in the camp of al-Hajuri and upon the firmly established (biological) principle, "<i>What goes in, must come out</i>" one will not be surprised in the least any more when witnessing the likes of this emanating from these people.</b>    <P>
By this stage in the fitnah, where shock turns into bewilderment and bewilderment turns into laughter, there only remains pity and compassion - nothing else seems to be working. So we make du'a to Allaah, the Mighty and Exalted that He guides these poor souls away from this misguidance and makes them see outside of the bubble they have been encapsulated in, Ameen.     <P>
</blockquote> <P>
