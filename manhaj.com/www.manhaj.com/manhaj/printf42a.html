<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>The following is a serialization in parts of an article written by Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee in exposing the misguidance of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi. You can refer to the original Arabic <a href=http://www.albaidha.net/vb/showthread.php?t=46986>posted here</a>. Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee was a student of Shaykh Muqbil and also spent time studying with Yahya al-Haddadi. He has a number of very good articles which give a great deal of context and background to the deviation of al-Hajuri, many of these things are not revealed to those in the West and it will be very eye-opening inshaa'Allaah. Meanwhile the fanatics of al-Hajuri continue their futile defence of their Imaam and continue attacking those who are with the firmly-grounded Scholars such as Shaykh Rabee', Shaykh Ubayd, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee and others. One should also note that there is no one with al-Hajuri except the youths and youngsters he is propping up as "Shaykhs" to make it look to everyone that there are lots of "Shaykhs" with him. There aren't. He is on his own with "thousands" of his students now being promoted to shaikhdom in order to give life-support to the corpse of Yahyah al-Haddadi's reputation.</blockquote></div> <P> 


<p><font class='titleHeadline'>The Usool of <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> Opposed by <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> and Those With Him: Part 2 - Uniting the Word and Al-Hajuri's <a href='tags/oppression.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>oppression</font></a> and Transgression Will Fall Back Upon Him </font>  <blockquote>By Shaykh Alee al-Hudhayfee (former student of Shaykh Muqbil and of Yahya al-Hajuri)</blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'> This is because Allaah ordered <a href='tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a> and cordiality and prohibited splitting and differing. For this reason, Allaah made unlawful all the causes of quarrelling, hatred and splitting, and ordered all the causes of cordiality and love and commended rectification between (parties) and made it to be most excellent of actions and nearness (to Allaah). And He ordered clinging to the Jamaa'ah, and He informed, the Sublime, upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) that His hand is over the Jamaa'ah. And the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) (<a href='tags/unity.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>unity</font></a>) behind the rulers - be they pious or sinful, so long as their sin does not expel them from Islaam - and he ordered jihaad with those rulers and informed that jihaad and hajj will remain operative behind them until the establishment of the Hour. And he  prohibited from rebelling against them and removing the hand of obedience from them and all of this is due to what there is in the uniting of the word of great, mighty benefits which return to Islam and its people of strength and togetherness.     <P>
And this foundation from the foundations of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah has been written down by our Scholars in the books of creed so that it becomes a foundation from the foundations of Islaam and a broad path from its various broad paths. And they are not spoken of as "Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah" except due to their (practical) observance of this mighty foundation, from which many of the people of deviation and misguidance have deviated from.     <P>
Al-Tahawi said in his aqeedah, "<i>And we hold (sticking to) the Jamaa'ah to be the truth and correctness. And we hold splitting to be deviation and a punishment</i>."    <P>
And the point of evidence in that is that splitting is a (manifestation) of deviation from the path, and for that reason, its callers are deviants away from the path of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah who command with uniting the word.    <P>
And it is very sad for him that al-Hajuri does not depend upon this foundation and does not give it any concern. Hence, separating from all of Ahl al-Sunnah, except those who agree with him, became a very easy affair upon him, and so he judged them with misguidance out of <a href='tags/oppression.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>oppression</font></a>, envy and enmity and there is nothing more severe in splitting than that. So whoever shunned the way of the people of knowledge, declared the innocent ones to be misguided without any reflection, consideration and thoughtful hesitation - the way of those deeply grounded in knowledge - then these wrongdoings and declaring others misguided will return back to him, and these oppressive rulings will return back to him, and he will exit from the manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah without dignity.   </blockquote>    <P>
<blockquote><b>Comment:</b>    <P>
These are truthful words, this is how the reality has turned out, al-Hajuri's transgressions and oppressions over the many years has led to this pitiful state and he has eventually been spoken of by Shaykh Rabee',  (<span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1571;&#1614;&#1590;&#1614;&#1585;&#1617; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575;&#1587; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1614;&#1617;&#1593;&#1618;&#1600;&#1608;&#1614;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1604;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1548; &#1604;&#1575;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1581;&#1614;&#1583; &#1571;&#1614;&#1590;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1617; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1610;&#1581;&#1610;&#1609;</span>), "<i>The most harmful of people to the Salafi Da'wah, there is no one more harmful than Yahyaa</i>" (<a href=index067b.html?dedtt>see this article</a>) and he has been spoken of by notable Salafi Scholars known for many long years to be firm and steadfast as "<i>safeeh</i> (idiot)" and "<i>mubtadi</i> (innovator)" and "<i>daall</i> (astray)" and what is like this - so he left the way of Ahl al-Sunnah without dignity and the stripping of all dignity was something his students guaranteed for him through their excessive and laughable <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> (exaggeration):    <P>
The <a href=indexac51.html?gxpqv>Gemini superstar</a>, <a href=indexd3af.html?rkwbk>Imaam of Imaams</a>,  <a href=indexac51.html?gxpqv>the star of stars</a> and  the <a href=index5d28.html?zzpwe>glistening light</a> that outshines both the sun and moon, the <a href=index36db.html?imbec>sealed musk of Paradise</a>, the <a href=index16bc.html?weerq>one invoked (from a distance) with <i>istighaathah</i> in times of grief</a>, the one <a href=indexb504.html?upjgs>whose boots deserved to be polished perpetually, for multiple lifetimes</a> and <a href=index41ba.html?mddzw>he to whom people flock as</a> they do to the Ka'bah, his royal highness,  <a href=indexf3b8.html?mdbmo>majestic of flesh</a>,  <b>Yahya al-Hajuri [al-Haddadi al-Mubtadi']</b>    <P>
One would never imagine (in 14 centuries of Islaam), that Ahl al-Sunnah would ever have to refute nonsense and stupidity like this!    <P>
