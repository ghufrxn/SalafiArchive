He had shown rejection against Ab&#363; al-&#7716;asan al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; (d. 324H) when he came to Baghd&#257;d and claimed attachment to madhhab of Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad. The &#7716;anbal&#299;s in general had hatred of al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; and his madhhab which was rooted in the approach of Ibn Kull&#257;b and &#7716;&#257;rith al-Mu&#7717;&#257;sib&#299; whom Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad had severely warned against. This trend among the followers of the creed of Im&#257;m A&#7717;mad, which is the creed of the Salaf, continued with Ab&#363; &#7716;&#257;mid al-Isfar&#257;y&#299;n&#299; (d. 406H), and he was the shaykh of the Sh&#257;f&#299;&#702;is. He would openly warn against Ab&#363; Bakr al-B&#257;qill&#257;n&#299; (d. 403H) who was spreading the Ash&#703;ar&#299; ideology. <b><a href=assets/docs/manhaj-sharh-sunnah-baqillani.pdf>Download PDF File</a></b> </div>    <P>
