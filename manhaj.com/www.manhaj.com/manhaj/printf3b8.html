<div class='sidebar'><blockquote>Yahyaa al-Hajooree is a the leader of new wave of al-Haddaadiyyah which has emerged to cause splits amongst the ranks of Ahl al-Sunnah. Like <a href='tags/al-haajooree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-<a href="tags/haajooree.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Haajooree</font></a></font></a>, they display vile, foul speech, have errors in understanding the usool. Consequently, they err in implementing the usool of Ahl al-Sunnah when it comes to dealing with Ahl al-Sunnah, their ijtihaads, and their mistakes. Al-Hajooree has spawned a movement of mostly young, ignorant, charged-up youths who are deceived by the small amount of knowledge they have acquired into thinking they have reached the status of being able to mock, revile, abuse and speak ill of major and senior scholars. As if this was not bad enough, they added to this excessive praises and exaggerations for their leader which were mostly met with acceptance by the leader himself, who has been alleged by his followers to be "the Imaam of the thaqalayn (men and jinn)" and "star amongst stars."    <P>
Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah said, "<b>Sincerity and love of praise and hoping for what the people have do not come together in the heart except as fire and water and a lizard and a fish come together</b>." (al-Fawaa'id p. 149).    <P>
In this series we will give some illustrations of the type of exaggeration (<a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a>) that <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> al-Haddadi has received from his followers - indicating the type of tarbiyah provided by Yahya al-Haddadi. One can contrast this with the absence of such <a href='tags/ghuluww.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ghuluww</font></a> emanating from the students of the genuine scholars. These examples were compiled by Abdullah bin Qasim al-Madkhali.</blockquote>  </div>    <P>
Abu Muslim Ahmad bin Muhammad bin al-Husayn al-Hajuri al-Za'kari expressed the following repugnant lines of poetry:    <P>
<blockquote><div align=center><span class='arb' dir='rtl'>&#1604;&#1608; &#1584;&#1614;&#1608;&#1614;&#1617;&#1576;&#1615;&#1608;&#1607;&#1615; &#1604;&#1584;&#1614;&#1575;&#1576;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1581;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1607;&#1615; &#1587;&#1615;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1611; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1589;&#1614;&#1575;&#1585;&#1614; &#1570;&#1610;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1603;&#1616;&#1578;&#1614;&#1575;&#1576;&#1616; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1614;&#1575;&#1602;&#1616;&#1610;</span></div></blockquote>    <P>
Which translate as:    <P>
<blockquote>If they were to melt him (<a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a>), his flesh would have melted as the Sunnah and would have become the verses of the Remaining Book. </blockquote>    <P>
From the angle of justice, the author of these lines did issue a retraction (2nd Rabi al-Thani 1430H) and likewise the other bigoted and cult-followers of al-Hajuri, such as Abdul-Hameed al-Hajuri, they also removed it <u>after first acknowledging it, being satisfied with it, and having published it and distributed it</u>.     <P>
Despite this, there are some notes on this:    <P>
<blockquote><b><u>First:</u></b> The students and followers of al-Hajuri were not able to see the baatil (falsehood) in this poetry to the extent that they published and distributed it. Then when it was pointed out, they retracted and removed it. This shows the lack of fahm (understanding) in the deen. Fine, you retracted, but how on earth did such a vile statement get passed you in the first place? What Tawheed, Sunnah and <a href='tags/salafiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Salafiyyah</font></a> have you been studying or been taught such that such a calamity should arise in the first place? <u>That's the real issue</u>.     <P>
<b><u>Second:</u></b> The flesh of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> turning into the verses of the Qur'an implies that the Qur'an is created in that it can take the form of something created. Its one over the Ash'aris who said the Qur'an is "<i>an expression of the kalaam nafsee</i>" and over the Christians who said "<i>the word became flesh</i>" whereas in the case of al-Hajuri, "<i>the (melted) flesh became the word</i>." Upon the poetry of this misguided follower of al-Hajuri (Abu Muslim Ahmad al-Hajuri) and likewise those who initially cited, published and distributed this poetry (like Abdul-Hameed al-Hajuri) it is as if the flesh of al-Hajuri is an expression of the verses of the Qur'an. At the same time, this also implies the aqidah of <u>al-hulool</u> (indwelling) whereby the melted flesh of <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> becomes an attribute from the attributes of Allaah (His uncreated Speech, the Qur'an) and thus we see two repugnant things arising from this vile poetry - implication that the Qur'an is created and implication that al-Hajuri indwells with Allaah, morphing into one of His uncreated attributes. The author of the lines protested that his intent was merely to show the intensity with which Yahya holds fast to the Book and Sunnah. But wait a minute, we are seeing a disturbing pattern here (see next) - despite the retractions - and in any case, what jahl (ignorance) and misguidance is it that you utter statements whose utter baatil (falsehood) completely passes you by - this shows that the Hajuri Cult is not nurtured upon a thorough understading and appreciation of the <a href='tags/tawhid.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Tawhid</font></a> of the Messengers.     <P>
<b><u>Third:</u></b> We are seeing the students of Yahya al-Haddadi presenting a picture that appears to be uniform in indicating the tarbiyah these people have received - <a href='tags/yahya-al-hajuri.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Yahya al-Hajuri</font></a> is loftier than the constellation of Gemini, he is like the Ka'bah around whom people encircle, he has combined the traits of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), the Companions, the Salaf and contemporary Imams of the Sunnah, he is "<i>the Imaam of the Jinn and Men</i>" he is titled with the titles of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), "<i>al-Naasih al-Ameen</i>", melt his flesh and it becomes the verses of the Qur'an ... and so on and so on and so on. Now, if this was an isolated occurrence, it occurred once and that was it, one instance of madness can be overlooked, but when you see a whole pattern emerging, that can not be treated in the same way, because this now indicates that a disease is present.    <P>
<b><u>Fourth:</u></b> At the same time al-Hajuri belittles the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) [The Messenger erred in a matter that is tawqeefee, the ways and means of da'wah], and affirms what his ignoramus students write that even the Messenger's speech is not taken except with evidence(!), and al-Hajuri states as a matter of belief that the Companions participated in the murder of Uthmaan (<a href=index31af.html?taggg>then lies about it</a>), the bid'ah of Irjaa' originated with one of the Companions he claims and Abu Dhar al-Ghifaree was a Takfeeree, as was <a href='tags/al-barbahaaree.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Barbahaaree</font></a> affected by a takfiri mentality. "Piss" on the principle of al-Shafi'ee says al-Hajuri (sorry about the language, but its merely a citation from the tongue of al-Hajuri and is in fact just a mild example from the sum of whatever other filth can be cited from this alleged "Imaam of Jinn and Men"). So now you understand what is going on here, al-Hajuri is being raised and praised, he is physically closer to Allaah than everyone else (because he has reached heights greater than the constellation of Gemini), and meanwhile there is a certain type of tarbiyah being found in the writings of al-Hajuri himself and those of his students regarding the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam), the Companions, the Salaf, a type of belittlement and disdain.     <P>
<b>Fifth:</b> The <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> (followers of the cult of al-Hajuri) have made much effort to indicate that al-Hajuri is not pleased with this and that recantations have been made. <b>This begs  questions.</b> Why are we seeing a disturbing pattern that we have not seen from the students of the genuine scholars? Why are there such outrageous, extreme statements that would simply not come from a heart, mind and tongue that has been nurtured upon pure Tawheed and pure Sunnah? All of this is pointing towards something disturbing that is residing there in <a href='tags/dammaaj.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Dammaaj</font></a> - a type of murky <a href='tags/hizbiyyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hizbiyyah</font></a>, a cultish mentality. How many retractions are we seeing, and whilst the <a href='tags/hajaawirah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Hajaawirah</font></a> protest with these retractions, saying isn't this a good and praiseworthy thing, the real question is what grounding in knowledge do you people really have such that you are forced to make retractions on issues such as these? And yet on many issues you (and your leader, al-Hajuri) are not forthcoming in making retractions at all?</blockquote>    <P>
