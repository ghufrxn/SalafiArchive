In his explanation of the chapter on the types of magic in Kitab al-Tawheed, Shaykh Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah) states in <i>Sharh Kitab al-Tawheed</i> (Dar al-Diyaa, 1422H, p. 135):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And magic (sihr) is of two types:    <P>
<ul><li> A type which occurs through knots, blowing and harmful potions, and this is present    <P>
<li>A type that occurs through takhyeel (making someone imagine or perceive something), and talbees (deception) and tazweer (fabrication), as the Exalted said about the magicians of Pharoah, "<b>Then behold, their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast</b>." (20:66) and He said, "<b>And they displayed a great magic</b>." (7:116). Hence, he labelled it as "great" on account of what it comprises of deception and making people imagine, perceive things (upon other than the reality).</ul>    <P>
And whoever performed magic has committed Shirk, whoever engaged in magic, because it occurs through the worship of the devils (shayaateen) and invoking them, and for this reason, Allaah said, "<b>Sulaimaan did not disbelieve, but the Shayaateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic</b>..." (2:102), and He said, <b>"But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, 'We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us)'</b>." (2:102). So this indicates that learning it necessitates disbelief.  </blockquote>    <P>
Sulaymaan Aal al-Shaykh said in <i>Tayseer al-Azeez al-Hameed</i> (p. 297):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>And his saying, "Whoever does magic has committed shirk" is a text that the magician is a mushrik since he does not bring his magic without (committing) shirk as has been cited by al-Haafidh from some of them.</blockquote>    <P>
And Shaykh Ibn al-Uthaymeen said in <i>al-Qawl al-Mufeed</i> (2/47-48):    <P>
<blockquote class='quote'><img src='images/quote-start.gif'>(<i>Whoever</i>) is a conditional particle, and the action of the condition is (<i>does magic</i>) and the answer to the condition is (<i>has committed shirk</i>). And this does not apply to all magic, since the intent behind (<i>Whoever does magic</i>) is that with satanic routes. As for magic through potions and medications and what is like them, then it has already preceded that he is not  a mushrik, however the one who does magic through obeying the devils and using them for what he desires (of goals), then there is no doubt this one is a mushrik.</blockquote>    <P>
Refer to <i>Mughnee al-Mureed al-Jaami' Li Shurooh Kitaab al-Tawhid</i> of Abd al-Mun'im Ibraaheem (1420H, p. 1850). <P>
