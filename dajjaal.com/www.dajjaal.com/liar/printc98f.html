<p><div class='sidebar'>In two previous articles we covered texts from the Qur'an that relate to the issue of magic and the occult, in particular, <b>a)</b> the luring of <a href='tags/adam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Adam</font></a> by <a href='tags/iblis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iblis</font></a> through the promise of everlasting life, immortality, becoming angelic and an everlasting kingdom (<a href=indexe4af.html?bgxjt>see this article</a>) and <b>b)</b> the teaching of magic by the devils to the Judaics in the time of <a href='tags/sulayman.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sulayman</font></a> and also by the two angels in <a href='tags/babylon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Babylon</font></a> (<a href=index3360.html?feicu>see this article</a>).</div>      <P>
The false promise of <a href='tags/iblis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iblis</font></a> (of eternal life and immortality through special knowledge and "illumination") along with magic and its associated numerology, astrology coming from <a href='tags/babylon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Babylon</font></a>,  transmitted by the Judaics in a codified form known as the "<a href="tags/qabbalah.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">Qabbalah</font></a>" has been behind much of the corruption (shirk, kufr,  immorality) through the ages. In this article we want to look at another verse addressing the issue of magic in relation to those who were previously given something of the Book (i.e. revelation).    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>Concerning <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href="tags/at-taghut.html" class="tagLink"><font class="tagLink">at-Taghut</font></a></font>    <P>

At-Tabari (d. 310H) brings with his asaaneed, a large number of narrations from the classic commentators in explanation of the words <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a>, and so what we can do here is to summarize them in the form of a table:    <P>
<table width=520 style="border-top:1px solid #999999;border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">    <P>

There are also two narrations in which Mujahid explains "<i><a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a></i>" to mean "<i>Satan in the form of a man, to whom the people refer to in judgment and who is in charge of their affair</i>." And there are also narrations from Ibn Abbaas (radiallaahu anhu) and ad-Dahhaak which between them explain <i><a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a></i> and <i><a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a></i> to mean "Ka'b bin al-Ashraf (al-Yahoodi)" or "Hayyiy bin Akhtab (al-Yahoodi)" interchangeably.    <P>
After all these narrations at-Tabari explains that both <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a> admit to numerous explanations all of which are simultaneously valid and correct, and they are:    <P>
<ul><li>al-Jibt and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a> are two (interchangeable) names for every glorified, worshipped or obeyed entity besides Allaah, whether that may be a stone, tree or devil.  <li> That the idols worshipped besides Allaah (by the people of jaahiliyyah) are also <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and at-Taghut  <li> That <u>the devils</u> obeyed by the disbelievers are also are <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and at-Taghut  <li> That <u>the magicians</u> and <u>the soothsayers</u> are also <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a> (as we have seen from the narrations above)  <li> That <u>al-Ka'b bin al-Ashraf</u> and <u>Hayyiy bin Akhtab</u> are <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a> for they were obeyed by the Judaics in kufr and disobedience  </ul>    <P>
And so our intent here is to highlight the fact that <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and <a href='tags/at-taghut.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>at-Taghut</font></a> are interchangeable terms to refer to: <u>Magic, sorcery, soothsaying, magicians, soothsayers, <a href='tags/satan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Satan</font></a> and the devils</u>, and that this verse is in reference to al-Yahood (Judaics), and they were the ones who followed what the devils rehearsed in the time of <a href='tags/sulayman.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Sulayman</font></a> (alayhis salaam) of magic, and also what was revealed to the Angels at <a href='tags/babylon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Babylon</font></a>, and these people they apostatized from what Moses (alayhis salaam) and abandoned the Tawrah and mixed their religion with magic, mystery, superstition and the likes. So remember what is stated in the above verse (<span class='arb'>&#1610;&#1615;&#1572;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1616;&#1576;&#1618;&#1578;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1591;&#1617;&#1614;&#1575;&#1594;&#1615;&#1608;&#1578;&#1616; </span>), "<b>They believe in <a href='tags/al-jibt.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>al-Jibt</font></a> and at-taghut</b>" in light of the explanations from the classical commentators, meaning they believe in <a href='tags/satan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Satan</font></a> and magic.    <P>
<div class='sidebar'>When the Judaics were held captive in <a href='tags/babylon.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Babylon</font></a> by Nebuchadnezzar in the 6th century BC, they added to their magic the astrology and numerology of the Chaldean Babylonians, the remnants of the people of Nimrod, and this magic was passed on orally through secret initiation only and it is what is called "the Qabbalah". Although basic elements of it were put into writing (in the 13th century AD) with the higher, more esoteric and and innermost secretive aspects only taught through initiation.</div>    <P>
<font class='titleHeadline'>The Core Secrets in the Mystery Religions of the Occultists</font>    <P>
And at the core of this magic (in the innermost circles) <u>from  what is explicitly stated and written in their books</u> is the belief that immortality can be achieved, and it is possible to become angelic, or that one can merge with God and become God, and that <a href='tags/iblis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iblis</font></a> was truthful, and that he was wrongly cast out, and that he gave intellect (i.e. illumination, enlightenment) to <a href='tags/adam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Adam</font></a> (which God wanted to hide from <a href='tags/adam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Adam</font></a>, as they claim and believe) or that the <a href='tags/adam.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Adam</font></a> and his offspring are in fact emanations of God who can become immortal through that secret knowledge, and that it is through this so-called illumination that the practitioners of this magic (worshipers of the devils) believe that they can progress towards immortality, and that <a href='tags/iblis.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Iblis</font></a> was in reality the true God, and he wanted good for mankind, and that he is in reality mankind's savior by "enlightening" man. And thus "Lucifer" (<a href='tags/satan.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Satan</font></a>) is the real God and savior of mankind, and this is known as the "Luciferian doctrine". It is being pushed to the masses today through what is called "<i><a href='tags/new-age-spirituality.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>New Age Spirituality</font></a></i>", and this is also being used as a vehicle to unite all religions.     <P>
These notions we have mentioned in the above paragraph are really getting right down to the core of <u>what is believed by the occultists at the highest level</u>. We are not talking about your average street-magician, pir, faith-healer and the likes of these charlatans and fraudsters trying make a quick buck through the aid of the <a href='tags/jinn.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jinn</font></a> in putting magic upon people and then appearing as "healers", consuming the wealth of the people in falsehood. This is <u>your low level small-fry</u> at the very bottom of the ladder who is just seeking worldly gain through obedience to the devils, and these small-fry don't believe in these esoteric doctrines and they don't take it as a religion, they are just dabbling at the low level.     <P>
However, there are those <u>high-level occultists</u> who believe the doctrines we have outlined above and they are in league with the devils amongst the <a href='tags/jinn.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Jinn</font></a>, with both parties seeking mutual benefit from each other (<a href=indexb0d3.html?rrzil>see this article on that subject</a>). These are your Aleister Crowleys and your Helena Blavatskys (by way of example of the most disbelieving practitioners of magic and worshipers of the devils) who explicitly write and boast that they receive dictations of books (on magic and esoteric, secret knowledge) via "channelling" through spiritual beings (i.e. devils amongst the jinn) and this is an altogether different level of sorcerer (Satan worshiper) because they are upon this as a religion, <u>and what these people indulge in of activities</u> will make your average small-fry sorcerer appear to be innocent (even "righteous") by comparison!     <P>
    <P>
