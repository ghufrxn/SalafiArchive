The Qur'an is the uncreated speech of Allaah, the Exalted and it is from the most powerful of matters, alongside Tawhid, firm Eemaan (faith), and Taqwaa (piety, righteousness) that constitute a fortress and protection against the devils and the magic of the magicians. The following two files contain a collection of verses that are useful for <a href='tags/ruqyah.html' class='tagLink'><font class='tagLink'>Ruqyah</font></a> (Islamic incantations against magic).    <P>
<div class='sidebar'><ul><li>The first PDF file contains all of the surahs, passages and verses in the Qur'an that are specifically mentioned in the Sunnah or have been proven to be useful and effective through collective experience in combatting the devils, magic and its effects.<BR>  <a href=assets/docs/islamic-ruqyah.pdf>Download the File</a>    <P>
<li>This second PDF file is shorter and includes those verses that relate specifically to the magic of the magicians, its falsehood, and its invalidation, and these are very effective.<BR>  <a href=assets/docs/islamic-ruqyah-magicians.pdf>Download the File</a></ul></div>    <P>
Anyone who is affected by magic should strive to take control of their own affair and to recognize that magic only occurs by the permission of Allaah, that it is a trial and a test, and that it is breakable through the Tawhid of Allaah, through firm knowledge, faith and through the Qur'an and the supplications mentioned in the Sunnah. Unfortunately, most people do not realize that their excessive reliance upon others to help them in their predicament, and their seeking of a quick fix solution is a manifestation of weakness that allows the  magic to persist or to recur again. The susceptibility to  magic is often a result of years of negligence, being far from the deen, from Allaah, and not being firm upon Tawhid, so a person has to make broad and wide-ranging set of changes in order to combat this evil.  <P>
