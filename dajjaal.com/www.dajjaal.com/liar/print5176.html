<b><font color='red'>Update 4th July 2020: It gets worse and worse for Team Dajaajilah, just when you thought it could not possibly get any worse than it already is:</font></b>     <P>
There are some audio excerpts of the same lecture which was delivered on other occasions.    <P>
One of them was Leeds, the talk was done again, over two years later (see <b><a href=http://www.salafitalk.com/threads/1781-Leeds-Conference-The-Evils-of-Magic>SalafiTalk.Com post here</a></b>) and see also <b><a href=assets/images/magic-talk-leeds.png>the poster</a></b> for this event.     <P>
<b>Leeds November 2013:</b> Here is the clip:<BR>  <audio controls>  <source src="assets/audio/sulayman-sihr-lecture-ai-leeds-2013-11-16.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">  Your browser does not support the audio element.  </audio>     <P>

Recently, some misguided entertainers, performance artists and online actors from among Ahl al-Bid&#703;ah conspired in a team to slander me and then engage in actions of technical, computer fraud in order to malign me.     <P>
They first extracted a clip from a lecture of mine--which I did in Leeds on Saturday, 27th February 2010--and they claimed that I had slandered the Prophet Sulaym&#257;n (&#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;). They published a video about this on 31st May 2020. <a href=http://dajjaal.com/liar/assets/docs/sulayman-jinn-magic.pdf>After I clarified myself and exposed their evil plot</a> (see page 24), they fell on the back foot and then hatched another evil plot.     <P>
They then claimed the lecture was from 10 September 2005, a pure invention on  their behalf, and that I had told a lie. They engaged in the deliberate, calculated fabrication of evidence through manipulation of computer system dates in order to backdate the metadata information of the electronic file of the audio clip.     <P>
They then promoted their act of fraud on the tube and social media in order to play with the emotions and intellects of their followers, having first deceived themselves into thinking that they will escape the justice of All&#257;h (&#1593;&#1586; &#1608;&#1580;&#1604;) on the Day of Judgement and that they will not be exposed in this life before the next.     <P>
Then, after knowing for two weeks that I had made a clarification and having used the very document that I published in which I said that the talk was around 2010, they then fabricated a third lie, after the first two failed to stick. And this was that I had now allegedly repented from what they slandered me with in the first lie. All of this was a show for their audience.     <P>
This series of articles will address this issue.   </div>  </blockquote>  </div>    <P>
