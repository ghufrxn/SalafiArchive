<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which sin is the  greatest in Allah&#8217;s Sight?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To set up a rival unto Allah  though He Alone created you . &#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; The man said,  &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse  with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; So Allah revealed in confirmation of this  narration:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And those who invoke not with Allah, any other god. Nor  kill, such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause nor commit illegal sexual  intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment.&#8217; (25.68) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A faithful believer remains at  liberty regarding his religion unless he kills somebody unlawfully.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One of the evil deeds with bad consequence from which there  is no escape for the one who is involved in it is to kill someone unlawfully. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 4: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The first cases to be decided among  the people (on the Day of Resurrection) will be those of blood-shed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 5: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr Al-Kindi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An ally of Bani Zuhra who took part in the battle of Badr  with the Prophet, that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I meet an unbeliever and we  have a fight, and he strikes my hand with the sword and cuts it off, and then takes refuge  from me under a tree, and says, &#8216;I have surrendered to Allah (i.e. embraced Islam),&#8217; may I  kill him after he has said so?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not kill him.&#8221;  Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;But O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he  said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said. &#8220;Do not  kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you  kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the  sentence.&#8221; The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, &#8220;If a faithful believer conceals  his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill  him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at  Mecca before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No human being is killed unjustly,  but a part of responsibility for the crime is laid on the first son of Adam who invented  the tradition of killing (murdering) on the earth. (It is said that he was Qabil). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said during Hajjat-al-Wada&#8217;, &#8220;Let the  people be quiet and listen to me. After me, do not become disbelievers, by striking  (cutting) the necks of one another.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Al-Kaba&#8217;ir (the biggest sins) are:  To join others (as partners) in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one&#8217;s  parents,&#8221; or said, &#8220;to take a false oath.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Shu&#8217;ba is not  sure) Mu&#8217;adh said: Shu&#8217;ba said, &#8220;Al-kaba&#8217;ir (the biggest sins) are: (1) Joining  others as partners in worship with Allah, (2) to take a false oath (3) and to be undutiful  to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; or said, &#8220;to murder (someone unlawfully). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The biggest of Al-Kaba&#8217;ir (the  great sins) are (1) to join others as partners in worship with Allah, (2) to murder a  human being, (3) to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents (4) and to make a false statement,&#8221;  or said, &#8220;to give a false witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 11: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama bin Zaid bin Haritha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us (to fight) against Al-Huraqa (one  of the sub-tribes) of Juhaina. We reached those people in the morning and defeated them. A  man from the Ansar and I chased one of their men and when we attacked him, he said,  &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; The Ansari refrained from  killing him but I stabbed him with my spear till I killed him. When we reached (Medina),  this news reached the Prophet. He said to me, &#8220;O Usama! You killed him after he had  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! He said so in order to save himself.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You killed him  after he had said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; The Prophet kept  on repeating that statement till I wished I had not been a Muslim before that day. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samat: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was among those Naqibs (selected leaders) who gave the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. We gave the oath of allegiance, that we would not  join partners in worship besides Allah, would not steal, would not commit illegal sexual  intercourse, would not kill a life which Allah has forbidden, would not commit robbery,  would not disobey (Allah and His Apostle), and if we fulfilled this pledge we would have  Paradise, but if we committed any one of these (sins), then our case will be decided by  Allah. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 14: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to help that man (i.e., &#8216;Ali), and on the way I met  Abu Bakra who asked me, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am going to  help that man.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go back, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If two  Muslims meet each other with their swords then (both) the killer and the killed one are in  the (Hell) Fire.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is alright for the killer, but what about  the killed one?&#8217; He said, &#8216;The killed one was eager to kill his opponent.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.083.015"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 15: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones, and  the girl was asked, &#8220;Who has done that to you, so-and-so or so and so?&#8221; (Some  names were mentioned for her) till the name of that Jew was mentioned (whereupon she  agreed). The Jew was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet kept on questioning him till  he confessed, whereupon his head was crushed with stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A girl wearing ornaments, went out at Medina. Somebody  struck her with a stone. She was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle asked her, &#8220;Did such-and-such a person strike you?&#8221; She raised her head,  denying that. He asked her a second time, saying, &#8220;Did so-and-so strike you?&#8221;  She raised her head, denying that. He said for the third time, &#8220;Did so-and-so strike  you?&#8221; She lowered her head, agreeing. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then sent for the killer and  killed him between two stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The blood of a Muslim who  confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle,  cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits  illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew killed a girl so that he may steal her ornaments. He  struck her with a stone, and she was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive. The  Prophet asked her, &#8220;Did such-and-such person strike you?&#8221; She gestured with her  head, expressing denial. He asked her for the second time, and she again gestured with her  head, expressing denial. When he asked her for the third time, she beckoned,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So the Prophet killed him (the Jew) with two stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them  in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;Allah held  back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers  overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in  Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after  me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is  at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not  be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who  would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to  choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer  killed.&#8221; Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood up and said, &#8220;Write that)  for me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to his companions), &#8220;Write  that for Abu Shah.&#8221; Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for  graves.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-idhkkir.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was  Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was  not permitted as an alternate. But Allah said to this nation (Muslims): &#8216;O you who  believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, &#8230;..(up to) &#8230;end of the Verse.  (2.178) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse,  means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: The Verse:  &#8216;Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.&#8217; (2.178) means that  the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with the Prophet to Khaibar. A man (from the  companions) said, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Let us hear some of your Huda (camel-driving  songs.)&#8221; So he sang some of them (i.e. a lyric in harmony with the camels walk). The  Prophet said, &#8220;Who is the driver (of these camels)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Amir.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on him !&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you let us enjoy his company  longer!&#8221; Then &#8216;Amir was killed the following morning. The people said, &#8220;The good  deeds of &#8216;Amir are lost as he has killed himself.&#8221; I returned at the time while they  were talking about that. I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Let my  father be sacrificed for you! The people claim that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s good deeds are lost.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so is a liar, for &#8216;Amir will have a double reward as he  exerted himself to obey Allah and fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause. No other way of killing would  have granted him greater reward.&#8221; </font></p>

We  went to Khaibar and found one of us murdered.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Let the older  among you come forward and speak.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, to them, &#8220;Bring your  proof against the killer.&#8221; They said &#8220;We have no proof.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Then they (the defendants) will take an oath.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not  accept the oaths of the Jews.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not like that the Blood-money of  the killed one be lost without compensation, so he paid one-hundred camels out of the  camels of Zakat (to the relatives of the deceased) as Diya (Blood-money). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qilaba: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz sat on his throne in the  courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him. Then he admitted them  and (when they came in), he said, &#8220;What do you think of Al-Qasama?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;We say that it is lawful to depend on Al-Qasama in Qisas, as the previous Muslim  Caliphs carried out Qisas depending on it.&#8221; Then he said to me, &#8220;O Abu Qilaba!  What do you say about it?&#8221; He let me appear before the people and I said, &#8220;O  Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs.  If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in  Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in  Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one  of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed  (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man  who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&#8221;  Then the people said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle cut off the  hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&#8221; I said,  &#8220;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &#8220;Eight persons from the  tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became  Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and  complained about that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &#8220;Won&#8217;t you go out with  the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine)?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So they went out and drank the camels&#8217; milk and urine, and  after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and took away all  the camels. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces  and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands  and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them  in the sun till they died.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What can be worse than what those people  did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Anbasa bin Said said, &#8220;By Allah, I never heard a  narration like this of today.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O &#8216;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&#8221;  &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be  related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is  among them.&#8221; I added, &#8220;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed  some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people  went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we have found our companion who  had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went out and asked them, &#8220;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed  him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We think that the Jews have killed him.&#8221; The Prophet sent  for the Jews and asked them, &#8220;Did you kill this (person)?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked the Al-Ansars, &#8220;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an  oath that they have not killed him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It matters little for the Jews  to kill us all and then take false oaths.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then would you like to  receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your  man)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not take the oath.&#8221; Then the Prophet himself  paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;The tribe of Hudhail  repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, at a place called Al-Batha&#8217; (near Mecca), the man  attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed  him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured  the Yemenite and brought him to &#8216;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &#8220;He has killed  our companion.&#8221; The Yemenite said, &#8220;But these people had repudiated him (i.e.,  their companion).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had  not repudiated him.&#8221; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging  to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid  one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him  and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &#8220;We  and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a  place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the  cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the  two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on  the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year  and then died.&#8221; I further said, &#8220;&#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to  death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but  later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who  had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in  Sham.&#8221; </font></p>

So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him, he said (to him), &#8220;If  I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your  eye with this (sharp iron bar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The asking for  permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there  is in the house without the permission of its people).&#8221; </font></p>

Anas is an intelligent boy, so let him serve you.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;So I  served the Prophet L at home and on journeys; by Allah, he never said to me for anything  which I did: Why have you done this like this or, for anything which I did not do: &#8216;Why  have you not done this like this?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew whose face had been slapped (by someone), came to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! A man from your Ansari companions slapped me. &#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Call him&#8221;. They called him and the Prophet asked him,  &#8220;Why did you slap his face?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! While I was  passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, &#8216;By Him Who chose Moses above all the human  beings.&#8217; I said (protestingly), &#8216;Even above Muhammad?&#8217; So I became furious and slapped  him.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the  people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain  conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of the pillars of the Throne (of  Allah). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me or he has been  exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) which he  received.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.080.716">Volume 8, Book 80, Number 716: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I became sick so Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came on foot  to pay me a visit. When they came, I was unconscious. Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed ablution  and he poured over me the water (of his ablution) and I came to my senses and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall I do regarding my property? How shall I distribute  it?&#8221; The Prophet did not reply till the Divine Verses of inheritance were revealed . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 717: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Beware of suspicion, for it is the  worst of false tales and don&#8217;t look for the other&#8217;s faults and don&#8217;t spy and don&#8217;t hate  each other, and don&#8217;t desert (cut your relations with) one another O Allah&#8217;s slaves, be  brothers!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 90) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 718: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima and Al &#8216;Abbas came to Abu Bakr, seeking their share  from the property of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and at that time, they were asking for their land at  Fadak and their share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said to them, &#8221; I have heard from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Our property cannot be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be  spent in charity, but the family of Muhammad may take their provisions from this  property.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;By Allah, I will not leave the procedure I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle following during his lifetime concerning this property.&#8221; Therefore  Fatima left Abu Bakr and did not speak to him till she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 719: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Our (Apostles&#8217;) property should not  be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.080.720"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 720: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;I went and entered upon &#8216;Umar, his doorman, Yarfa came  saying &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d are asking your permission (to see you).  May I admit them? &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So he admitted them Then he came again and said, &#8216;May  I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O, chief of the believers! Judge  between me and this man (Ali ). &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I beseech you by Allah by Whose permission  both the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our (the  Apostles&#8217;) property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave (after our death) is to  be spent in charity?&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself.&#8217; The group said, &#8216;(No  doubt), he said so.&#8217; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8216;Do you both know that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;(No doubt), he said so.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;So let me  talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this Fai&#8217; (i.e.  booty won by the Muslims at war without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah gave to His Apostle ( Fai&#8217;  Booty) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;to do all things&#8230;.(59.6) And so that property was only for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . Yet, by Allah, he neither gathered that property for himself nor withheld it  from you, but he gave its income to you, and distributed it among you till there remained  the present property out of which the Prophet used to spend the yearly maintenance for his  family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s property is spent  (i.e. in charity etc.). Allah&#8217;s Apostle followed that throughout his life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know all that?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar then said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8216;I beseech you by Allah, do you know  that?&#8217; Both of them said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar added, &#8216;And when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;  I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and took charge of that property and managed it in  the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I took charge of this property for two years during  which I managed it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas)  came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You  came to me asking for your share from the property of your nephew, and this man (Ali) came  to me, asking for the share of h is wife from the property of her father. I said, &#8216;If you  both wish, I will give that to you on that condition (i.e. that you would follow the way  of the Prophet and Abu Bakr and as I (Umar) have done in man aging it).&#8217; Now both of you  seek of me a verdict other than that? Lo! By Allah, by Whose permission both the heaven  and the earth exist, I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is  established. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will be  sufficient to manage it on your behalf.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 721: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Not even a single Dinar of my  property should be distributed (after my deaths to my inheritors, but whatever I leave  excluding the provision for my wives and my servants, should be spent in charity.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, his wives  intended to send &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Aisha said to them, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah&#8217;s Apostle say, &#8216;Our (Apostles&#8217;) property is  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 723: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am more closer to the believers  than their own selves, so whoever (of them) dies while being in debt and leaves nothing  for its repayment, then we are to pay his debts on his behalf and whoever (among the  believers) dies leaving some property, then that property is for his heirs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Give the Fara&#8217;id (the shares of the  inheritance that are prescribed in the Qur&#8217;an) to those who are entitled to receive it.  Then whatever remains, should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased  .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 725: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was stricken by an ailment that led me to the verge of  death. The Prophet came to pay me a visit. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have much  property and no heir except my single daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my property in  charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One-third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You may do so) though  one-third is also to a much, for it is better for you to leave your off-spring wealthy  than to leave them poor, asking others for help. And whatever you spend (for Allah&#8217;s sake)  you will be rewarded for it, even for a morsel of food which you may put in the mouth of  your wife.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I remain behind and fail to  complete my emigration?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you are left behind after me,  whatever good deeds you will do for Allah&#8217;s sake, that will upgrade you and raise you  high. May be you will have long life so that some people may benefit by you and others  (the enemies) be harmed by you.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula  as he died in Mecca. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula was a man from the  tribe of Bani &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad bin Yazid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal came to us in Yemen as a tutor and a  ruler, and we (the people of Yemen) asked him about (the distribution of the property of )  a man who had died leaving a daughter and a sister. Mu&#8217;adh gave the daughter one-half of  the property and gave the sister the other half. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 727: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give the Fara&#8217;id (shares  prescribed in the Qur&#8217;an) to those who are entitled to receive it; and whatever remains,  should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 728: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Huzail bin Shirahbil: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa was asked regarding (the inheritance of) a  daughter, a son&#8217;s daughter, and a sister. He said, &#8220;The daughter will take one-half  and the sister will take one-half. If you go to Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, he will tell you the  same.&#8221; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud was asked and was told of Abu Musa&#8217;s verdict. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud then said,  &#8220;If I give the same verdict, I would stray and would not be of the rightly-guided.  The verdict I will give in this case, will be the same as the Prophet did, i.e. one-half  is for daughter, and one-sixth for the son&#8217;s daughter, i.e. both shares make two-thirds of  the total property; and the rest is for the sister.&#8221; Afterwards we cams to Abu Musa  and informed him of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud&#8217;s verdict, whereupon he said, &#8220;So, do not ask me for  verdicts, as long as this learned man is among you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The person about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I were  to take a Khalil from this nation (my followers), then I would have taken him (i.e., Abu  Bakr), but the Islamic Brotherhood is better (or said: good),&#8221; regarded a grandfather  as the father himself (in inheritance). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 731: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(During the early days of Islam), the inheritance used to  be given to one&#8217;s offspring and legacy used to be bequeathed to the parents, then Allah  cancelled what He wished from that order and decreed that the male should be given the  equivalent of the portion of two females, and for the parents one-sixth for each of them,  and for one&#8217;s wife one-eighth (if the deceased has children) and one-fourth (if he has no  children), for one&#8217;s husband one-half (if the deceased has no children) and one-fourth (if  she has children).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the judgment that a male or female  slave should be given in Qisas for an abortion case of a woman from the tribe of Bani  Lihyan (as blood money for the fetus) but the lady on whom the penalty had been imposed  died, so the Prophets ordered that her property be inherited by her offspring and her  husband and that the penalty be paid by her Asaba. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal gave this verdict for us in the lifetime  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One-half of the inheritance is to be given to the daughter and the  other half to the sister. Sulaiman said: Mu&#8217;adh gave a verdict for us, but he did not  mention that it was so in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 734: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Huzail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;The judgment I will give in this  matter will be like the judgment of the Prophet, i.e. one-half is for the daughter and  one-sixth for the son&#8217;s daughter and the rest of the inheritance for the sister.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 735: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sick, the Prophet entered upon me and asked for  some water to perform ablution, and after he had finished his ablution, he sprinkled some  water of his ablution over me, whereupon I became conscious and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have sisters.&#8221; Then the Divine Verses regarding the laws of inheritance  were revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The last Quranic Verse that was revealed (to the Prophet)  was the final Verse of Surat-an-Nisa, i.e., &#8216;They ask you for a legal verdict Say: Allah  directs (thus) About those who leave No descendants or ascendants as heirs&#8230;.&#8217; (4.176) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 737: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I am more closer to the  believers than their ownselves, so whoever (among them) dies leaving some inheritance, his  inheritance will be given to his &#8216;Asaba, and whoever dies leaving a debt or dependants or  destitute children, then I am their supporter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 80, Number 739: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: regarding the Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And to  everyone, We have appointed heirs. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the emigrants came to Medina, the Ansar used to be the  heir of the emigrants (and vice versa) instead of their own kindred by blood  (Dhawl-l-arham), and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had  established between them, i.e. the Ansar and the emigrants. But when the Divine Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And to everyone We have appointed heirs,&#8217; (4.33) was  revealed, it cancelled the other, order i.e. &#8216;To those also, to whom Your right hands have  pledged.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man and his wife had a case of Lian (or Mula&#8217;ana) during  the lifetime of the Prophet and the man denied the paternity of her child.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Utba (bin Abi Waqqas) said to his brother Sa&#8217;d, &#8220;The  son of the slave girl of Zam&#8217;a is my son, so be his custodian.&#8221; So when it was the  year of the Conquest of Mecca, Sa&#8217;d took that child and said, &#8220;He is my nephew, and  my brother told me to be his custodian.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said,  &#8216;but the child is my brother, and the son of my father&#8217;s slave girl as he was born on his  bed.&#8221; So they both went to the Prophet. Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This is)  the son of my brother and he told me to be his custodian.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said,  &#8220;(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, born on his  bed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;This child is for you. O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a, as the child  is for the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones.&#8221; He then ordered  (his wife) Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba. Since then the boy had never seen Sauda till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I bought Barira (a female slave). The Prophet said (to me),  &#8220;Buy her as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; Once she was given a sheep (in  charity). The Prophet said, &#8220;It (the sheep) is a charitable gift for her (Barira) and  a gift for us.&#8221; Al-Hakam said, &#8220;Barira&#8217;s husband was a free man.&#8221; Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;When I saw him, he was a slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her  masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; (after her death) would be for them. &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her masters  stipulated that her Wala&#8217; will be for them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Manumit her as  the Wala is for the one who manumits (the slave),&#8221; or said, &#8220;The one who pays  her price.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha bought and manumitted her. After that, Barira was given the  choice (by the Prophet) (to stay with her husband or leave him). She said, &#8220;If he  gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him.&#8221; (Al-Aswad added: Her  husband was a free man.) The sub-narrator added: The series of the narrators of Al-Aswad&#8217;s  statement is incomplete. The statement of Ibn Abbas, i.e., when I saw him he was a slave,  is more authentic. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We have no Book to recite except the Book of Allah (Qur&#8217;an)  and this paper. Then &#8216;Ali took out the paper, and behold ! There was written in it, legal  verdicts about the retaliation for wounds, the ages of the camels (to be paid as Zakat or  as blood money). In it was also written: &#8216;Medina is a sanctuary from Air (mountain) to  Thaur (mountain). So whoever innovates in it an heresy (something new in religion) or  commits a crime in it or gives shelter to such an innovator, will incur the curse of  Allah, the angels and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds  will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever (a freed slave) takes as his  master (i.e. be-friends) some people other than hi real masters without the permission of  his real masters, will incur the curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and none  of his compulsory, or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And  the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the Muslims, even if it is  granted by one of the lowest social status among them; and whoever betrays a Muslim, in  this respect will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of  his Compulsory or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

After that,  the Prophet caller her (Barira) and gave her the choice to go back to her husband or not.  She said, &#8220;If he gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him.&#8221;  So she selected her ownself (i.e. refused to go back to her husband).&#8221; </font></p>

This (boy) is the son of my brother, &#8216;Utba bin  Abi Waqqas who told me to be his custodian as he was his son. Please notice to whom he  bears affinity.&#8221; And &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;This is my brother, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! He was born on my father&#8217;s bed by his slave girl.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked  at the boy and noticed evident resemblance between him and &#8216;Utba, so he said, &#8220;He  (the toy) is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a, for the boy is for the owner of the bed, and the  stone is for the adulterer. Screen yourself before the boy, O Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha added: Since then he had never seen Sauda. </font></p>

Then both of them went to (the Prophet) Solomon,  son of David and informed him of the case. Solomon said, &#8216;Give me a knife so that I may  cut the child into two portions and give one half to each of you.&#8217; The younger lady said,  &#8216;Do not do so; may Allah bless you ! He is her child.&#8217; On that, he gave the child to the  younger lady.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: By Allah!

<h3 align="center">Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.079.699"></a>Volume 8, Book 79, Number 699:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and he said to me, &#8220;Come near.&#8221; So I went near to him and he said, &#8220;Are your lice troubling you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting, Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Aiyub said, &#8220;Fasting should be for three days, and the Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to six poor persons.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 700:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual relation with my wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got enough to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he sat down. Afterwards an &#8216;Irq, i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Take this and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we?&#8221; On that, the Prophet smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, &#8220;Feed your family with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 701:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said to him?&#8221; &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then an Ansari man came with an Irq (a big basket full of dates). The Prophet said (to the man), &#8220;Take this (basket) and give it in charity.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth! There is no house in between the two mountains (of the city of Medina) poorer than we.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go and feed it to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 702:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophets and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; Later on an Irq (big basket) containing dates was given to the Prophet, and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take this basket and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we? Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 703:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ju&#8217;aid bin Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings on their measures, Sa&#8217; and Mudd (i.e., of the people of Medina) &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody manumits a Muslim slave, Allah will save from the Fire every part of his body for freeing the corresponding parts of the slave&#8217;s body, even his private parts will be saved from the Fire) because of freeing the slave&#8217;s private parts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 707:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) for me?&#8221; Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, &#8220;That was a coptic slave who died in the same year.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 708:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that she intended to buy Barira (a slave girl) and her masters stipulated that they would have her Wala&#8217;. When &#8216;Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet ; he said, &#8220;Buy her, for the Wala&#8217; is for the one who manumits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 709:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 710:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 711:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 713:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 714:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration as above (i.e. No. 712).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 715:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!) Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.593">Volume 8, Book 77, Number 593: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said,  &#8220;Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns  into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a  similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four  things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the  blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person  among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or  an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has  ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and  enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit  or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of  the people of the Fire and enters it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.594"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 594: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah puts an angel in charge of  the uterus and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O  Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation,  the angel asks, &#8216;O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a  blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?&#8217; So all  that is written while the creature is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 595: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the people of  Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he  will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do.&#8221; (i.e. everybody will find  easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been  created). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ; was asked about the offspring of the pagans.  He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 597: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about the offspring of the  pagans. He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No child  is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It  is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one  before you mutilate them yourself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do  you think about those (of them) who die young?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah knows  what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No woman should ask for the  divorce of her sister (Muslim) so as to take her place, but she should marry the man  (without compelling him to divorce his other wife), for she will have nothing but what  Allah has written for her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 599: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa&#8217;d, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  and Mu&#8217;adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his  daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 600: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and  we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Allah  has ordained to come into existence but will be created.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.601"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 601: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of  us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events  taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before  their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who  has been absent and then sees and recognizes him. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.602"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 602: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.603"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 603: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.604"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 604: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 605: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet forbade vowing and said, &#8220;In fact, vowing  does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.606"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 606: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (that Allah said), &#8220;Vowing does not  bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is  imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his  wealth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 607: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet said, &#8220;No Caliph is appointed but has  two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and  the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the  one whom Allah protects.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding the Verse) &#8220;And We granted the vision  (Ascension to the heavens &#8220;Miraj&#8221;) which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual  eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.&#8217; (17.60): Allah&#8217;s Apostle actually saw with his  own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night  Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the  Qur&#8217;an is the tree of Az-Zaqqum. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Adam and Moses argued with each  other. Moses said to Adam. &#8216;O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us  out of Paradise.&#8217; Then Adam said to him, &#8216;O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Warrad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Muawiya wrote to  Mughira. &#8216;Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.&#8217; So Al-Mughira  dictated to me and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying after the prayer, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold  what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is  useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;I have kept for you a  secret.&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;Ad-Dukh.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Keep quiet,  for you cannot go beyond your limits (or you cannot exceed what has been foreordained for  you).&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop off his  neck!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave him, for if he is he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal), then you  will not be able to overcome him, and if he is not, then you gain no good by killing  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the plague. He said,  &#8220;That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whom-so-ever He wished,  but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town  in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but has  patience and hopes for Allah&#8217;s reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what  Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the Prophet on the Day of (the battle of) Al-Khandaq,  carrying earth with us and saying, &#8220;By Allah, without Allah we would not have been  guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would we have prayed. O Allah! Send down Sakina  (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet (the enemy). The pagans have  rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse  (to flee).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 5). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet drew a square and then drew a line in the  middle of it and let it extend outside the square and then drew several small lines  attached to that central line, and said, &#8220;This is the human being, and this, (the  square) in his lease of life, encircles him from all sides (or has encircled him), and  this (line), which is outside (the square), is his hope, and these small lines are the  calamities and troubles (which may befall him), and if one misses him, an-other will snap  (i.e. overtake) him, and if the other misses him, a third will snap (i.e. overtake)  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(an ally of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai and one of  those who had witnessed the battle of Badr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu  &#8216;Ubaida bin AlJarrah to Bahrain to collect the Jizya tax. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had concluded a  peace treaty with the people of Bahrain and appointed Al &#8216;Ala bin Al-Hadrami as their  chief; Abu Ubaida arrived from Bahrain with the money. The Ansar heard of Abu &#8216;Ubaida&#8217;s  arrival which coincided with the Fajr (morning) prayer led by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When the  Prophet finished the prayer, they came to him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled when he saw them and  said, &#8220;I think you have heard of the arrival of Abu &#8216;Ubaida and that he has brought  something.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! &#8221; He said, &#8220;Have  the good news, and hope for what will please you. By Allah, I am not afraid that you will  become poor, but I am afraid that worldly wealth will be given to you in abundance as it  was given to those (nations) before you, and you will start competing each other for it as  the previous nations competed for it, and then it will divert you (from good) as it  diverted them.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The thing I am afraid of most  for your sake, is the worldly blessings which Allah will bring forth to you.&#8221; It was  said, &#8220;What are the blessings of this world?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The  pleasures of the world.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;Can the good bring forth evil?&#8221; The  Prophet kept quiet for a while till we thought that he was being inspired divinely. Then  he started removing the sweat from his forehead and said,&#8221; Where is the  questioner?&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I (am present).&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id added: We thanked  the man when the result (of his question) was such. The Prophet said, &#8220;Good never  brings forth but good. This wealth (of the world) is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and  all the vegetation which grows on the bank of a stream either kills or nearly kills the  animal that eats too much of it, except the animal that eats the Khadira (a kind of  vegetation). Such an animal eats till its stomach is full and then it faces the sun and  starts ruminating and then it passes out dung and urine and goes to eat again. This  worldly wealth is (like) sweet (fruit), and if a person earns it (the wealth) in a legal  way and spends it properly, then it is an excellent helper, and whoever earns it in an  illegal way, he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet added, &#8220;And  after them there will come people who will bear witness, though they will not be asked to  give their witness; and they will be treacherous and nobody will trust them, and they will  make vows, but will not fulfill them, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221; </font></p>

I walked with  him a little longer. Then he said to me, &#8220;Sit down here.&#8221; So he made me sit in  an open space surrounded by rocks, and said to me, &#8220;Sit here till I come back to  you.&#8221; He went towards Al-Harra till I could not see him, and he stayed away for a  long period, and then I heard him saying, while he was coming, &#8220;Even if he had  committed theft, and even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse?&#8221; When he  came, I could not remain patient and asked him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Let Allah get me  sacrificed for you! Whom were you speaking to by the side of Al-Harra? I did not hear  anybody responding to your talk.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Gabriel who appeared to me  beside Al-Harra and said, &#8216;Give the good news to your followers that whoever dies without  having worshipped anything besides Allah, will enter Paradise.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Gabriel!

I  would have spent all of it (distributed it) amongst Allah&#8217;s Slaves like this, and like  this, and like this.&#8221; The Prophet pointed out with his hand towards his right, his  left and his back (while illustrating it). He proceeded with his walk and said, &#8220;The  rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except those who  spend their wealth like this, and like this, and like this, to their right, left and back,  but such people are few in number.&#8221; Then he said to me, &#8220;Stay at your place and  do not leave it till I come back.&#8221; Then he proceeded in the darkness of the night  till he went out of sight, and then I heard a loud voice, and was afraid that something  might have happened to the Prophet .1 intended to go to him, but I remembered what he had  said to me, i.e. &#8216;Don&#8217;t leave your place till I come back to you,&#8217; so I remained at my  place till he came back to me. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I heard a voice and I was  afraid.&#8221; So I mentioned the whole story to him. He said, &#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Gabriel who came to me and said,  &#8216;Whoever died without joining others in worship with Allah, will enter Paradise.&#8217; I asked  (Gabriel), &#8216;Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?

By Allah, if he should ask for a  lady&#8217;s hand in marriage, he ought to be given her in marriage, and if he intercedes for  somebody, his intercession will be accepted.

Then Umar passed by me and I asked  him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger,  but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet ) passed by me and he  smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, &#8220;O  Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said  to me, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; He left and I followed him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter  and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, &#8220;From where is this milk?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such  woman).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go and call the people of Suffa to me.&#8221; These people of  Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon,  and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet , he would send it to them  and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to  send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order off the Prophet upset me,  and I said to myself, &#8220;How will this little milk be enough for the people of  As-Suffa?&#8221; thought I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen  myself, but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered  what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His  Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the  Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Aba-Hirr!&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take it and give it to them.&#8221;  So I took the bowl (of Milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and  return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink  his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his  fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached  the Prophet who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said.  &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said,  &#8220;There remain you and I.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have said the truth, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221; I sat down and drank. He said,  &#8220;Drink,&#8221; and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said,  &#8220;No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my  stomach).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hand it over to me.&#8221; When I gave him the bowl, he  praised Allah and pronounced Allah&#8217;s Name on it and drank the remaining milk. </font></p>

The Prophet  said, &#8220;Let him who wants to look at a man from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire, look  at this (man).&#8221; Another man followed him and kept on following him till he (the  fighter) was injured and, seeking to die quickly, he placed the blade tip of his sword  between his breasts and leaned over it till it passed through his shoulders (i.e.,  committed suicide).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;A person may do deeds that seem to the  people as the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact, he is from the dwellers of  the (Hell) Fire: and similarly a person may do deeds that seem to the people as the deeds  of the people of the (Hell) Fire while in fact, he is from the dwellers of Paradise.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle narrated to us two narrations, one of which  I have seen (happening) and I am waiting for the other. He narrated that honesty was  preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in the beginning) and then they learnt it  (honesty) from the Qur&#8217;an, and then they learnt it from the (Prophet&#8217;s) Sunna (tradition).  He also told us about its disappearance, saying, &#8220;A man will go to sleep whereupon  honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling the  traces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be  taken away (from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the  surface of skin, when an ember touches one&#8217;s foot; and in fact, this blister does not  contain anything. So there will come a day when people will deal in business with each  other but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons among them. Then it will be said  that in such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is honest, and a man will  be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed he will not have  belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; The narrator added: There came upon me  a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his  religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler  would prevent him from cheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and  so-and-so.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on  the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold ! Moses  will be there holding the side of Allah&#8217;s Throne. I will not know whether Moses has been  among those people who have become unconscious and then has regained consciousness before  me, or has been among those exempted by Allah from falling unconscious.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I stood at the gate of Paradise and  saw that the majority of the people who had entered it were poor people, while the rich  were forbidden (to enter along with the poor, because they were waiting the reckoning of  their accounts), but the people of the Fire had been ordered to be driven to the Fire. And  I stood at the gate of the Fire and found that the majority of the people entering it were  women.&#8221; </font></p>

O people of the  Fire, no more death ! &#8216; So the people of Paradise will have happiness added to their  previous happiness, and the people of the Fire will have sorrow added to their previous  sorrow.&#8221; </font></p>

Ask, and your request will be granted, and say, and your saying will be  listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; Then I will raise my  head, and I will glorify and praise my Lord with a saying(i.e. invocation) He will teach  me, and then I will intercede, Allah will fix a limit for me (i.e., certain type of people  for whom I may intercede), and I will take them out of the (Hell) Fire and let them enter  Paradise. Then I will come back (to Allah) and fall in prostration, and will do the same  for the third and fourth times till no-one remains in the (Hell) Fire except those whom  the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned therein.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Qatada used to say at that  point, &#8220;&#8230;those upon whom eternity (in Hell) has been imposed.&#8221;) (See Hadith  No. 3, Vol 6). </font></p>

Is  there only one Paradise? There are many Paradises, and he is in the highest Paradise of  Firdaus.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;A forenoon journey or an after noon journey in  Allah&#8217;s Cause is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and a place equal to  an arrow bow of anyone of you, or a place equal to a foot in Paradise is better than the  whole world and whatever is in it; and if one of the women of Paradise looked at the  earth, she would fill the whole space between them (the earth and the heaven) with light,  and would fill whatever is in between them, with perfume, and the veil of her face is  better than the whole world and whatever is in it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our  Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you crowd and squeeze each other  on looking at the sun when it is not hidden by clouds?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you crowd and squeeze each other on looking at  the moon when it is full and not hidden by clouds?&#8221; They replied, No, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you will see Him (your Lord) on the Day of Resurrection  similarly Allah will gather all the people and say, &#8216;Whoever used to worship anything  should follow that thing. &#8216;So, he who used to worship the sun, will follow it, and he who  used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship false deities will  follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., Muslims) will remain, including their  hypocrites. Allah will come to them in a shape other than they know and will say, &#8216;I am  your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We seek refuge with Allah from you. This is our place; (we  will not follow you) till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us, we will  recognize Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will come to then in a shape they know and will  say, &#8220;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;(No doubt) You are our Lord,&#8217; and they will  follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added,  &#8220;I will be the first to cross it. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day,  will be &#8216;Allahukka Sallim, Sallim (O Allah, save us, save us!),&#8217; and over that bridge  there will be hooks Similar to the thorns of As Sa&#8217;dan (a thorny tree). Didn&#8217;t you see the  thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan?&#8221; The companions said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He  added, &#8220;So the hooks over that bridge will be like the thorns of As-Sa-dan except  that their greatness in size is only known to Allah. These hooks will snatch the people  according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some  will be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Allah  has finished the judgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever  He wishes to take out from among those who used to testify that none had the right to be  worshipped but Allah. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We will order the angels to take them out and the angels  will know them by the mark of the traces of prostration (on their foreheads) for Allah  banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the body of Adam&#8217;s son. So they  will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then water, called  Maul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed  springs out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be  facing the (Hell) Fire and will say, &#8216;O Lord! It&#8217;s (Hell&#8217;s) vapor has Poisoned and smoked  me and its flame has burnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire.&#8217; He will keep on  invoking Allah till Allah says, &#8216;Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for  another thing?&#8217; The man will say, &#8216;No, by Your Power, I will not ask You for anything  else.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man  will say after that, &#8216;O Lord, bring me near the gate of Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say (to  him), &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How  treacherous you are!&#8217; The man will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will say, &#8216;But if I  give you that, you may ask me for something else.&#8217; The man will say, &#8216;No, by Your Power. I  will not ask for anything else.&#8217; He will give Allah his covenant and promise not to ask  for anything else after that. So Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and  when he sees what is in it, he will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will  say, &#8216;O Lord! Let me enter Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you promise that you would  not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you  are!&#8217; On that, the man will say, &#8216;O Lord! Do not make me the most wretched of Your  creation,&#8217; and will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will smile and when Allah will smile  because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he will enter Paradise,  he will be addressed, &#8216;Wish from so-and-so.&#8217; He will wish till all his wishes will be  fulfilled, then Allah will say, All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again  therewith are for you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people  of Paradise to enter (Paradise). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata (while Abu Huraira was narrating): Abu Said  was sitting in the company of Abu Huraira and he did not deny anything of his narration  till he reached his saying: &#8220;All this and as much again therewith are for you.&#8221;  Then Abu Sa&#8217;id said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;This is for you and ten times  as much.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;In my memory it is &#8216;as much again therewith.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The word &#8216;Al-Kauthar&#8217; means the abundant good which Allah  gave to him (the Prophet Muhammad).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam in his complete  shape and form (directly), sixty cubits (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him,  He said (to him), &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what  they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your  offspring.&#8221; Adam (went and) said, &#8216;As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon you).&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;AsSalamu-&#8216;Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you) So they  increased &#8216;Wa Rahmatullah&#8217; The Prophet added &#8216;So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of  the shape and form of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam&#8217;s (offspring) (i.e. stature of  human beings is being diminished continuously) to the present time.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Fadl bin &#8216;Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion  rider on the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice,  10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;Beware! Avoid sitting on the  roads.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! We can&#8217;t help sitting (on  the roads) as these are (our places) here we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216; l f you  refuse but to sit, then pay the road its right &#8216; They said, &#8220;What is the right of the  road, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8216;Lowering your gaze, refraining from harming  others, returning greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet  emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah&#8217;s Apostle for ten years (the last part of  his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of  Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. It was  revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with Zainab bint  Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone. At that time the Divine  Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his  family). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet married Zainab, the people came and were  offered a meal, and then they sat down (after finishing their meals) and started chatting.  The Prophet showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed  that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept  on sitting. When the Prophet returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but  then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet of their departure and he came and went  in. I intended to go in but the Prophet put a screen between me and him, for Allah  revealed:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses..&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Let your wives be veiled&#8221; But he did not do so. The wives of  the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.&#8217; Once  Sauda, the daughter of Zam&#8217;a went out and she was a tall woman. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw  her while he was in a gathering, and said, &#8220;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&#8221; He  (&#8216;Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling  of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover  excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man peeped through a round hole into the dwelling place  of the Prophet, while the Prophet had a Midray (an iron comb) with which he was scratching  his head. the Prophet said, &#8221; Had known you were looking (through the hole), I would  have pierced your eye with it (i.e., the comb).&#8221; Verily! The order of taking  permission to enter has been enjoined because of that sight, (that one should not look  unlawfully at the state of others). (See Hadith No. 807, Vol. 7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have not seen a thing resembling &#8216;lamam&#8217; (minor sins)  than what Abu Huraira &#8216;narrated from the Prophet who said &#8220;Allah has written for  Adam&#8217;s son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is  the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the  inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Musa replied,  &#8220;I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the  permission is not given, then he should return.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah! We  will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it.&#8221; (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the  Ansar and said). &#8220;Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet ?&#8221; Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  said, &#8220;By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a  witness).&#8221; (Abu Said) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed  &#8216;Umar that the Prophet had said so.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa-bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said, &#8220;The Prophet rode over a donkey  with a saddle underneath which there was a thick soft Fadakiya velvet sheet. Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik narrating (when he did not join the  battle of Tabuk): Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to speak to us. I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips to  return to my greetings or not till fifty nights passed away. The Prophet then announced  (to the people) Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for us (acceptance of our repentance) at the time when  he had offered the Fajr (morning) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu  Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, &#8220;Proceed till you reach  Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin  Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca).&#8221; So we overtook her while she was proceeding on  her camel at the same place as Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us. We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

Peace be on us and on the pious slaves of Allah, I testify  that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is  Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of the Prophet  during his fatal ailment. The people asked (&#8216;Ali), &#8220;O Abu Hasan! How is the health of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;This morning he is better, with the  grace of Allah.&#8221; Al-&#8216;Abbas held Ali by the hand and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see him  (about to die)? By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.  Besides, I will never ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; (See Hadith No 728, Vol 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was walking with the Prophet at the Hurra of Medina  in the evening, the mountain of Uhud appeared before us. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu  Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

Bless me with a (pious) good  companion.&#8221; So he sat beside Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; who asked, &#8220;From where are you?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;From the people of Kufa.&#8221; Abu Darda&#8217; said, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there among  you the person who keeps the secrets (of the Prophet ) which nobody knew except him (i.e.,  Hudhaifa (bin Al-Yaman)). And isn&#8217;t there among you the person whom Allah gave refuge from  Satan through the request (tongue) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle? (i.e., &#8216;Ammar). Isn&#8217;t there among  you the one who used to carry the Siwak and the cushion (or pillows (of the Prophets)?  (i.e., Ibn Mas&#8217;ud). How did Ibn Mas&#8217;ud use to recite &#8216;By the night as it conceals (the  light)?&#8221; (Sura 92). &#8216;Alqama said, &#8220;Wadhdhakari Wal Untha&#8217; (And by male and  female.&#8221;) Abu Ad-Darda added. &#8216;These people continued to argue with me regarding it  till they were about to cause me to have doubts although I heard it from Allah&#8217;s Apostle  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was no name dearer to &#8216;Ali than his nickname Abu  Turab (the father of dust). He used to feel happy whenever he was called by this name.  Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to the house of Fatima but did not find &#8216;Ali in the house. So he  asked &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;There was something (a quarrel)  between me and him whereupon he got angry with me and went out without having a midday nap  in my house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked a person to look for him. That person came, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went there and found him lying. His upper body cover had fallen off to one side of  his body, and so he was covered with dust. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started cleaning the dust from  him, saying, &#8220;Get up, O Abu Turab! Get up, Abu Turab!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 432, Vol  1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to Quba, he used to visit Um  Haram bint Milhan who would offer him meals; and she was the wife of &#8216;Ubada bin As-samit.  One day he went to her house and she offered him a meal, and after that he slept, and then  woke up smiling. She (Um Haram) said, &#8220;I asked him, &#8216;What makes you laugh, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Some people of my followers were displayed before me as warriors  fighting for Allah&#8217;s Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on thrones,&#8217; or said, &#8216;like  kings on thrones.&#8217; (The narrator, Ishaq is in doubt about it.) I (Um Haram) said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He may make me one of them.&#8217; He invoked (Allah) for her  and then lay his head and slept again and then woke up smiling. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  laugh, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Some people of my followers were displayed before me  as warriors fighting for Allah&#8217;s Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on the thrones,&#8217;  or said, &#8216;like kings on the thrones.&#8217; I (Um Haram) said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah  that He may make me one of them.&#8217; He said, You will be amongst the first ones.&#8221; It is  said that Um Haram sailed over the sea at the time of Muawiya, and on coming out of the  sea, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

So, be afraid of Allah, and be  patient, for I am the best predecessor for you (in the Hereafter).&#8217; &#8221; Fatima added,  &#8220;So I wept as you (&#8216;Aisha) witnessed. And when the Prophet saw me in this sorrowful  state, he confided the second secret to me saying, &#8216;O Fatima!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.073.001"></a>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Walid bin &#8216;Aizar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abi Amr &#8216;Ash-Shaibani saying, &#8220;The owner of this house.&#8221; he pointed to &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s house, &#8220;said, &#8216;I asked the Prophet &#8216;Which deed is loved most by Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To offer prayers at their early (very first) stated times.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had asked more, he would have told me more.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet, &#8220;Shall I participate in Jihad?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are your parents living?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; the Prophet said, &#8220;Do Jihad for their benefit.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&#8221; It was asked (by the people), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How does a man curse his parents?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While three persons were traveling, they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it. They said to each other. &#8216;Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn&#8217;t return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.&#8217; So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, &#8216;O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said &#8216;O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.&#8217; I said (to him). &#8216;Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.&#8217; And so Allah released them (from their difficulty).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden you ( 1 ) to be undutiful to your mothers (2) to withhold (what you should give) or (3) demand (what you do not deserve), and (4) to bury your daughters alive. And Allah has disliked that (A) you talk too much about others ( B), ask too many questions (in religion), or (C) waste your property.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said thrice, &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the great sins?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221; He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah: to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet sat up after he had been reclining and added, &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness; I warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying that warning till we thought that he would not stop.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the greatest sins or he was asked about the greatest sins. He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to kill a soul which Allah has forbidden to kill; and to be undutiful or unkind to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Shall I inform you of the biggest of the great sins? That is the forged statement or the false witness.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba (the sub-narrator) states that most probably the Prophet said, &#8220;the false witness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother came to me, hoping (for my favor) during the lifetime of the Prophet asked the Prophet, &#8220;May I treat her kindly?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Uyaina said, &#8220;Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Allah forbids you not with regards to those who fought not against you because of religion, and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them.&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;.(60.8)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That Heraclius sent for him and said, &#8220;What did he, i.e. the Prophet order you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He orders us to offer prayers; to give alms; to be chaste; and to keep good relations with our relatives.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet), &#8220;How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (&#8216;Umar&#8217;s brother) embraced Islam.</p>

What is the matter with him?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He has something to ask (what he needs greatly).&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and join none in worship with Him: You should offer prayers perfectly, give obligatory charity (Zakat), and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Leave it!&#8221; (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;It seems that the Prophet was riding his she camel.&#8221;</p>

Allah said, &#8216;Yes, won&#8217;t you be pleased that I will keep good relations with the one who will keep good relations with you, and I will sever the relation with the one who will sever the relations with you.&#8217; It said, &#8216;Yes, O my Lord.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Then that is for you &#8216; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added. &#8220;Read (in the Qur&#8217;an) if you wish, the Statement of Allah: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?&#8217; (47.22)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Ar-Rahm (womb) derives its name from Ar-Rahman (i.e., one of the names of Allah) and Allah said: &#8216;I will keep good relation with the one who will keep good relation with you, (womb i.e. Kith and Kin) and sever the relation with him who will sever the relation with you, (womb, i.e. Kith and Kin).</p>

And if somebody commits suicide with anything in this world, he will be tortured with that very thing on the Day of Resurrection; And if somebody curses a believer, then his sin will be as if he murdered him; And whoever accuses a believer of Kufr (disbelief), then it is as if he killed him.&#8221;</p>

So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.&#8221;</p>

And the hasty people went away, wondering. &#8220;Has the prayer been shortened&#8221; Among the people there was a man whom the Prophet used to call Dhul-Yadain (the longarmed). He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has it been shortened.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Surely, you have forgotten, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, Dhul-Yadain has told the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet got up and offered other two Rakat and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then he said Takbir, performed a prostration of ordinary duration or longer, then he raised his head and said Takbir and performed another prostration of ordinary duration or longer and then raised his head and said Takbir (i.e. he performed the two prostrations of Sahu, i.e., forgetfulness).&#8221;</p>

So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of &#8216;Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), &#8220;The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days).&#8221; So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others&#8217; sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, &#8220;I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.&#8221; They (Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.</p>

There was a man amongst us who was (from the Khawari) having a different opinion. He came saying. &#8220;Look at this old man! He left his prayer because of a horse.&#8221; On that Abu Barza came to us and said, &#8220;Since the time I left Allah&#8217;s Apostle, nobody has admonished me; My house is very far from this place, and if I had carried on praying and left my horse, I could not have reached my house till night.&#8221; Then Abu Barza mentioned that he had been in the company of the Prophet, and that he had seen his leniency.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But when he entered, the Prophet spoke to him gently in a polite manner. I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You have said what you have said, then you spoke to him in a very gentle and polite manner?

I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.&#8221; I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction. I said, &#8220;I can do more than that (fasting)&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fast three days every week.&#8221; But as I insisted (on fasting more) so I was burdened. I said, &#8220;I can fast more than that.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fast as Allah&#8217;s prophet David used to fast.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How was the fasting of the prophet David?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;One half of a year (i.e. he used to fast on alternate days). &#8216;</p>

So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, &#8220;What have you done (about the guests)?&#8221; They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet. He then called again. &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet and he called again, &#8220;O ignorant (boy)! I beseech you by Allah, if you hear my voice, then come out!&#8221; I came out and said, &#8220;Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me).&#8221; They said, &#8220;He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As you have been waiting for me, by Allah, I will not eat of it tonight.&#8221; They said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not eat of it till you eat of it.&#8221; He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don&#8217;t you accept your meals of hospitality from us?&#8221; (He said to me), &#8220;Bring your meal.&#8221; I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, &#8220;In the name of Allah.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;All that happened was from Satan.&#8221; So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), &#8220;O, sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8221; She said, &#8220;O, pleasure of my eyes! The meal is now more than it had been before we started eating&#8221; So they ate of it and sent the rest of that meal to the Prophet.

The Prophet said, &#8220;Let the older (among you) speak first.&#8221; So they spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. The Prophet said, &#8220;Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,&#8221; (or said, &#8220;..your companion&#8221;). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The murder was a thing we did not witness.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree&#8221; When I came out with my father, I said, &#8220;O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What prevented you from saying it?&#8221; Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar and we travelled during the night. A man amongst the people said to &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel&#8217;s foot steps, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is that driver (of the camels)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa.&#8221;&#8216; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His mercy on him.&#8221; A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are those fires? For what are you making fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking meat.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Donkeys&#8217; meat.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots.&#8221; A man said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You can do that too.&#8221; When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit &#8216;Amir&#8217;s knee and caused him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw me pale and said, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who said so?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, &#8216;Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, &#8216;Amir will have double reward.&#8221;&#8216; (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, &#8220;He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah&#8217;s Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an &#8220;Arab like him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! Didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;Abdullah bin Unbar). &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &#8216;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you&#8230;..and from the pagans (3.186)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8216;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. &#8230;. (2.109) So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&#8217;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&#8221;. Then they became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Muslim men emigrated to Ethiopia whereupon Abu Bakr also prepared himself for the emigration, but the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Wait, for I hope that Allah will allow me also to emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. Do you hope that (emigration)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on the leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Here is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his face covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must have brought you here at this hour.&#8221; The Prophet came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Let those who are with you, go out.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;(There is no stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8221; I shall accompany you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles! Let my father be sacrificed for you. Take one of these two she-camels of mine&#8221; The Prophet said. I will take it only after paying its price.&#8221; So we prepared their baggage and put their journey food In a leather bag. And Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the &#8216;Isha prayer. They would sleep soundly till &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">For one year I wanted to ask &#8216;Umar about the two women who helped each other against the Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &#8220;(They were) &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &#8216;Strange! You can retort in this way?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives.&#8217; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah&#8217;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &#8216;A great event has happened!&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Greater than that! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, &#8220;Ask the permission for me to enter.&#8221; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</p>

So the people started talking about the issue and said, &#8220;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. &#8220;Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &#8221; On that &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &#8220;Am I one of them, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

No, (she should observe the prescribed period Idda) for four months and ten days.&#8217;</p>

We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers,&#8221; and they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they be given some camels and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet ordered that their eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in that state.</p>

Those people differed in their opinions. Some of them said, &#8220;We have come out for a purpose and we do not think that it is proper to give it up,&#8221; while others said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;You have along with you. other people and the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so do not advise that we take them to this epidemic.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said to them, &#8220;Leave me now.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Call the Ansar for me.&#8221; I called them and he consulted them and they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they did. He then said to them, Leave me now,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest of Mecca.&#8221; I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, &#8220;We advise that you should return with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar made an announcement, &#8220;I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Would that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu &#8216;Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don&#8217;t you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?&#8221; At that time &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, &#8220;I have some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If you hear about it (an outbreak of plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not run away from it.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the companions of the Prophet came across a tribe amongst the tribes of the Arabs, and that tribe did not entertain them. While they were in that state, the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said, (to the companions of the Prophet ), &#8220;Have you got any medicine with you or anybody who can treat with Ruqya?&#8221; The Prophet&#8217;s companions said, &#8220;You refuse to entertain us, so we will not treat (your chief) unless you pay us for it.&#8221; So they agreed to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his people presented the sheep to them, but they said, &#8220;We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&#8221; When they asked him, he smiled and said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya?

The patient got cured and the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, &#8220;You have taken wages for reciting Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; When they arrived at Medina, they said, &#8216; O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, &#8220;Will you go to the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?&#8221; They came to them and said, &#8220;O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages.&#8221; Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Distribute (the sheep).&#8221; But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, &#8220;Do not do that till we go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us.&#8221; So they came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the story to him and he said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.648"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once came out to us and said, &#8220;Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, &#8216;This is Moses and his followers.&#8217; Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look&#8221; I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It was said, &#8220;Look this way and that way.&#8217; So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8220;These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (being asked about their) accounts. &#8221; Then the people dispersed and the Prophet did not tell who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of them said, &#8220;As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.&#8221; That talk reached the Prophet who said, &#8220;These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.&#8221; then &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am I one of those (70,000)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his verdict about two ladies of the Hudhail tribe who had fought each other and one of them had hit the other with a stone.

The guardian of the lady who was fined said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I be fined for a creature that has neither drunk nor eaten, neither spoke nor cried? A case like that should be nullified.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;This is one of the brothers of soothsayers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Khaibar was conquered, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was presented with a poisoned (roasted) sheep. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Collect for me all the Jews present in this area.&#8221; (When they were gathered) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;I am going to ask you about something; will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Abal-Qasim!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;Who is your father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Our father is so-and-so.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You have told a lie. for your father is so-and-so,&#8221; They said, &#8220;No doubt, you have said the truth and done the correct thing.&#8221; He again said to them, &#8220;If I ask you about something; will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Abal-Qasim! And if we should tell a lie you will know it as you have known it regarding our father,&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then asked, &#8220;Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We will remain in the (Hell) Fire for a while and then you (Muslims) will replace us in it&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them. &#8221;You will abide in it with ignominy. By Allah, we shall never replace you in it at all.&#8221; Then he asked them again, &#8220;If I ask you something, will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked. &#8220;Have you put the poison in this roasted sheep?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What made you do that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We intended to learn if you were a liar in which case we would be relieved from you, and if you were a prophet then it would not harm you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forbade the eating of wild animals having fangs. (Az-Zuhri said: I did not hear this narration except when I went to Sham.) Al-Laith said: Narrated Yunus: I asked Ibn Shihab, &#8220;May we perform the ablution with the milk of she-asses or drink it, or drink the bile of wild animals or urine of camels?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The Muslims used to treat themselves with that and did not see any harm in it. As for the milk of she-asses, we have learnt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of their meat, but we have not received any information whether drinking of their milk is allowed or forbidden.&#8221; As for the bile of wild animals, Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Idris Al-Khaulani told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of the flesh of every wild beast having fangs . &#8220;</p>

All those who want to perform ablution. The blessing is from  Allah.&#8221; I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed the  ablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and  capacity), for I knew that it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir,  &#8220;How many persons were you then?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We were one-thousand four  hundred men.&#8221; Salim said: Jabir said, 1500. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Al-Adha Festival Sacrifice (Adaahi)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.068.453"></a>Volume 7, Book 68, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer the (&#8216;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, he just slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet distributed among his companions some animals for sacrifice (to be slaughtered on &#8216;Id-al-Adha). &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s share was a Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old goat). &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I get in my share of Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old ram).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&#8221; A man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An uncle of mine called Abu Burda, slaughtered his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Your (slaughtered) sheep was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got a domestic kid.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be permissible for anybody other than you&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before the (&#8216;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;(Never mind), slaughter it to make up for the other one, but it will not be sufficient for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of &#8216;Id-Allah. a), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours is that we will offer the &#8216;Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter our sacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his family, and that was not a sacrifice.&#8221; Abu Burda got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

The man said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is to me better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Eat of the meat of sacrifices (of &#8216;Id al Adha) for three days.&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah departed from Mina, he used to eat (bread with) oil, lest he should eat of the meat of Hadi (which is regarded as unlawful after the three days of the &#8216;Id).</p>

<h3 align="center">Divorce</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.063.178"></a>Volume 7, Book 63, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Order him (your son) to take her back and keep her till she is clean and then to wait till she gets her next period and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he can divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the prescribed period which Allah has fixed for the women meant to be divorced.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 179:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;I divorced my wife while she was menstruating. &#8216;Umar mentioned that to the Prophet . The Prophet said, (to my father), &#8220;Let your son take her back.&#8221; I asked (Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Is such a divorce counted (i.e. as one legal divorce)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Of course.&#8221; Narrated Yunus bin Jubair: Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Order him (Ibn &#8216;Umar) to take her back.&#8217; &#8221; I asked, &#8220;Is such a divorce counted (as one legal divorce)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What do you think if someone becomes helpless and foolish?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 180:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Divorcing my wife during her menses) was counted as one legal divorce.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Awza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Az-Zuhri, &#8220;Which of the wives of the Prophet sought refuge with Allah from him?&#8221; He said &#8220;I was told by &#8216;Ursa that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the daughter of Al-Jaun was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (as his bride) and he went near her, she said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have sought refuge with The Great; return to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 182:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Usaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu&#8217;man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, &#8220;Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?&#8221; The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, &#8220;O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family.&#8221; Narrated Sahl and Abu Usaid: The Prophet married Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It seemed that she disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 183:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">similarly as above (182).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Ghallab Yunus bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar,&#8221;(What is said regarding) a man divorces his wife during her period?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know Ibn &#8216;Umar? Ibn &#8216;Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. &#8216;Umar then went to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. The Prophet ordered him to take her back and when she became clean, he could divorce her if he wanted.&#8221; I asked (Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Was that divorce counted as one legal divorce?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If one becomes helpless and foolish (will he be excused? Of course not). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 185:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin Adi Al-Ansari and asked, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! Tell me, if a man sees his wife with another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him in Qisas, or what should he do? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#8216;Asim heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hard on him. When he returned to his family, &#8216;Uwaimir came to him and said &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! What did Allah&#8217;s Apostle say to you?&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;You never bring me any good. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to hear the problem which I asked him about.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not leave the matter till I ask him about it.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was in the midst of the people and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man finds with his wife another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him (in Qisas): or otherwise, what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed something concerning the question of you and your wife. Go and bring her here.&#8221; So they both carried out the judgment of Lian, while I was present among the people (as a witness). When both of them had finished, &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep my wife with me, then I have told a lie&#8221;. Then he pronounced his decision to divorce her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to do so. (Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;That was the tradition for all those who are involved in a case of Lian.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 186:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wife of Rifa&#8217;a Al-Qurazi came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Rifa&#8217;a divorced me irrevocably. After him I married &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi who proved to be impotent.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to her, &#8220;Perhaps you want to return to Rifa&#8217;a? Nay (you cannot return to Rifa&#8217;a) until you and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman consummate your marriage.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 187:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man divorced his wife thrice (by expressing his decision to divorce her thrice), then she married another man who also divorced her. The Prophet was asked if she could legally marry the first husband (or not). The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, she cannot marry the first husband unless the second husband consummates his marriage with her, just as the first husband had done.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 188:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave us the option (to remain with him or to be divorced) and we selected Allah and His Apostle . So, giving us that option was not regarded as divorce.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 189:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Musruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha about the option: She said, &#8220;The Prophet gave us the option. Do you think that option was considered as a divorce?&#8221; I said, &#8220;It matters little to me if I give my wife the option once or a hundred times after she has chosen me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 190:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man divorced his wife and she married another man who proved to be impotent and divorced her. She could not get her satisfaction from him, and after a while he divorced her. Then she came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My first husband divorced me and then I married another man who entered upon me to consummate his marriage but he proved to be impotent and did not approach me except once during which he benefited nothing from me. Can I remarry my first husband in this case?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is unlawful to marry your first husband till the other husband consummates his marriage with you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 191:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;If a man makes his wife unlawful for him, it does not mean that she is divorced.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Indeed in the Apostle of Allah , you have a good example to follow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 192:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubaid bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8220;The Prophet used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house. So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us, she should say him, &#8220;I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8217; &#8221; So the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet said, &#8220;Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore.&#8221; So there was revealed: &#8216;O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,&#8217; (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. &#8216;When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.&#8217; (66.3) namely his saying: But I have taken some honey.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the &#8216;Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, &#8220;By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so).&#8221; So I said to Sada bint Zam&#8217;a &#8220;The Prophet will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: &#8216;Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then say to him: &#8216;Then what is this bad smell which i smell from you?&#8217; He will say to you, &#8216;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&#8217; Then say: Perhaps the bees of that honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-&#8216;Urfut.&#8217; I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the same.&#8221; Later Sada said, &#8220;By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet ) stood at the door, I was about to say to him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you.&#8221; So when the Prophet came near Sada, she said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you taken Maghafir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; She said. &#8220;Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-&#8216;Urfut tree.&#8221; When he came to me, I also said the same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet again went to Hafsa, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give you more of that drink?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not in need of it.&#8221; Sada said, &#8220;By Allah, we deprived him (of it).&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Keep quiet.&#8221; &#8216;</p>

The Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side again. The man moved again (and repeated his statement) for the fourth time. So when the man had given witness four times against himself, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you insane?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to his companions), &#8220;Go and stone him to death.&#8221; The man was a married one. Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari said: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying place) in Medina.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 210:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pagans were of two kinds as regards their relationship to the Prophet and the Believers. Some of them were those with whom the Prophet was at war and used to fight against, and they used to fight him; the others were those with whom the Prophet made a treaty, and neither did the Prophet fight them, nor did they fight him. If a lady from the first group of pagans emigrated towards the Muslims, her hand would not be asked in marriage unless she got the menses and then became clean. When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to get married, and if her husband emigrated too before she got married, then she would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave emigrated from them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free persons (not slaves) and they would have the same rights as given to other emigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the pagans involved with the Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in Mujahid&#8217;s narration. If a male slave or a female slave emigrated from such pagans as had made a treaty with the Muslims, they would not be returned, but their prices would be paid (to the pagans). Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Qariba, the daughter of Abi Umaiyya, was the wife of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar divorced her and then Mu&#8217;awiyya bin Abi Sufyan married her. Similarly, Um Al-Hakam, the daughter of Abi Sufyan was the wife of &#8216;Iyad bin Ghanm Al-Fihri. He divorced her and then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Uthman Al-Thaqafi married her.</p>

When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them . . .&#8217; (60.10) So if anyone of those believing women accepted the above mentioned conditions, she accepted the conditions of faith. When they agreed on those conditions and confessed that with their tongues, Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to them, &#8220;Go, I have accepted your oath of allegiance (for Islam). By Allah, and hand of Allah&#8217;s Apostle never touched the hand of any woman, but he only used to take their pledge of allegiance orally. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not take the pledge of allegiance of the women except in accordance with what Allah had ordered him. When he accepted their pledge of allegiance he would say to them, &#8220;I have accepted your oath of allegiance.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin Ad Al-Ansari and said to him, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, would he kill him whereupon you would kill him; or what should he do? Please, O &#8216;Asim, ask about this on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#8216;Asim heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hard on him. When &#8216;Asim returned to his family, &#8216;Uwaimir came to him and said, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! What did Allah&#8217;s Apostle. say to you?&#8221; &#8216;Asim said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;You never bring me any good. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked the problem which I asked him about.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give up this matter until I ask the Prophet about it.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the midst of people, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he kill him, whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed some decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her.&#8221; So they carried out the process of Lian while I was present among the people with Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When they had finished their Lian, &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife, then I have told a lie.&#8221; So he divorced her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him. (Ibn Shihab said: So divorce was the tradition for all those who were involved in a case of Lian.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl bin Sad, the brother of Bani Sa&#8217;idi He said, &#8220;An Ansari man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?&#8217; So Allah revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Quran about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.&#8217; So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet .&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother&#8217;s name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him.&#8221; Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As&#8217;Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above narration), &#8220;If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth.&#8221; Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).</p>

Then a man from his tribe came to him, complaining that he had found a man width his wife. &#8216;Asim said, &#8216;I have not been put to task except for my statement (about Lian).&#8217; &#8216;Asim took the man to the Prophet and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife. The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8217; So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he had found her with. The Prophet then made them carry out Lian.&#8221; Then a man from that gathering asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, &#8216;If I were to stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady&#8217;?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;No, that was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. &#8220;</p>

Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume which contained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls with it and then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, &#8220;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&#8217; &#8221; Zainab further said: I want to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died. She asked for perfume and used some of it and said, &#8220;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying on the pulpit, &#8216;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the last day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&#8217; &#8221; Zainab further said, &#8220;I heard my mother, Um Salama saying that a woman came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease, can she apply kohl to her eye?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed.&#8221; I said to Zainab, &#8220;What does &#8216;throwing a globe of dung when one year had elapsed&#8217; mean?&#8221; Zainab said, &#8220;When a lady was bereaved of her husband, she would live in a wretched small room and put on the worst clothes she had and would not touch any scent till one year had elapsed. Then she would bring an animal, e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her body against it. The animal against which she would rub her body would scarcely survive. Only then she would come out of her room, whereupon she would be given a globe of dung which she would throw away and then she would use the scent she liked or the like.&#8221;</p>

(In the Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance) a widowed woman among you would stay in the worst of her clothes (or the worst part of her house) and when a year had elapsed, if a dog passed by her, she would throw a globe of dung, Nay, (she cannot use kohl) till four months and ten days have elapsed.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day, to mourn for more than three days for a dead person, except for her husband, in which case she should neither put kohl in her eyes, nor perfume herself, nor wear dyed clothes, except a garment of &#8216;Asb&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya added: The Prophet said, &#8220;She should not use perfume except when she becomes clean from her menses whereupon she can use Qust, and Azfar (two kinds of incense).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse): &#8216;If any of you dies and leaves wives behind,&#8217; That was the period of the &#8216;Iddah which the widow was obliged to spend in the house of the late husband. Then Allah revealed: And those of you who die and leave wives should bequeath for their wives a year&#8217;s maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they leave, there is no blame on you for what they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240) Mujahid said: Allah has ordered that a widow has the right to stay for seven months and twenty days with her husband&#8217;s relatives through her husband&#8217;s will and testament so that she will complete the period of one year (of &#8216;Iddah). But the widow has the right to stay that extra period or go out of her husband&#8217;s house as is indicated by the statement of Allah: &#8216;But if they leave there is no blame on you,&#8230; &#8216; (2.240) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: The above Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the &#8216;Iddah at her late husband&#8217;s house, and so she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah wherever she likes. And Allah says: &#8216;Without turning them out.&#8217; &#8216;Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah at her husband&#8217;s house, and live there according to her (husband&#8217;s) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of her husband&#8217;s house) as Allah says: &#8216;There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.&#8217; (2.240) &#8216;Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the widow) was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah wherever she would like, and she was no longer entitled to be accommodated by her husband&#8217;s family.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Um Habiba bint Abi Sufyan was informed of her father&#8217;s death, she asked for perfume and rubbed it over her arms and said, &#8220;I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom the (mourning) period is four months and ten days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prohibited taking the price of a dog, the earnings of a soothsayer and the money earned by prostitution.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet cursed the lady who practices tattooing and the one who gets herself tattooed, and one who eats (takes) Riba&#8217; (usury) and the one who gives it. And he prohibited taking the price of a dog, and the money earned by prostitution, and cursed the makers of pictures.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;If a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse (what is the judgment)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Prophet separated the couple of Bani &#8216;Ajlan (when the husband accused his wife for an illegal sexual intercourse). The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah knows that one of you two IS a liar; so will one of you repent?&#8217; But they refused. He then again said, &#8216;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?&#8217; But they refused, whereupon he separated them by divorce.&#8221; Aiyub (a sub-narrator) said: &#8216;Amr bin Dinar said to me, &#8220;In the narration there is something which I do not see you mentioning, i.e. the husband said, &#8220;What about my money (Mahr)?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;You are not entitled to take back money, for if you told the truth you have already entered upon her (and consummated your marriage with her) and if you are a liar then you are less entitled to take it back.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to those who were involved in a case of Lian, &#8220;Your accounts are with Allah. One of you two is a liar. You (husband) have right on her (wife).&#8221; The husband said, &#8220;My money, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, &#8220;You are not entitled to take back any money. If you have told the truth, the Mahr that you paid, was for having sexual relations with her lawfully; and if you are a liar, then you are less entitled to get it back.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A time will come upon the people, when a group of people will wage a holy war and it will be said, &#8216;Is there amongst you anyone who has accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you a none who has accompanied the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you anyone who has been in the company of the companions of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And victory will be bestowed on them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter&#8221; &#8216;Imran added, &#8220;I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet added, &#8216;There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter. Then there will come some people who will bear witness before taking oaths, and take oaths before bearing witness.&#8221; (Ibrahim, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They used to beat us for witnesses and covenants when we were still children.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &#8216;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Tell Al-Bara&#8217; to carry the saddle for me.&#8221; &#8216;Azib said, &#8220;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &#8216;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &#8216;Lie down, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I belong to a man from Quraish.&#8217; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &#8216;Is there any milk with your sheep?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you then milk (some) for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&#8217;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &#8216;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &#8216;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &#8220;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Your companion has had a quarrel.&#8221; Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&#8216;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.</p>

And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.&#8221;</p>

This is good.&#8217; He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those&#8217; who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;He who is called from all those gates will need nothing,&#8221; He added, &#8220;Will anyone be called from all those gates, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-&#8216;Aliya) &#8216;Umar stood up and said, &#8220;By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is not dead!&#8221; &#8216;Umar (later on) said, &#8220;By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, kissed him and said, &#8220;Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah&#8217;s Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.&#8221; Then he went out and said, &#8220;O oath-taker! Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221; When Abu Bakr spoke, &#8216;Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.&#8221; Then he recited Allah&#8217;s Statement.:&#8211; &#8220;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&#8221; (39.30) He also recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&#8221; (3.144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin &#8216;Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). &#8220;There should be one &#8216;Amir from us and one from you.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu &#8216;baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. &#8216;Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. &#8216;Umar later on used to say, &#8220;By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &#8220;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&#8221; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &#8220;No, by Allah we won&#8217;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &#8216;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &#8216;Umar or Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar took Abu Bakr&#8217;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, &#8220;You have killed Sad bin Ubada.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has killed him.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said (in another narration), (&#8220;When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur&#8217;an 4.69)&#8217; Aisha said, Allah benefited the people by their two speeches. &#8216;Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting:&#8211; &#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..&#8221; (3.144)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, &#8220;You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.&#8221; He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on my thigh .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. &#8220;O family of Abu Bakr!

<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

You fear me more than you do Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, for you are harsher and sterner than Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Ibn Al-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Never does Satan find you going on a way, but he takes another way other than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When (the dead body of) &#8216;Umar was put on his deathbed, the people gathered around him and invoked (Allah) and prayed for him before the body was taken away, and I was amongst them. Suddenly I felt somebody taking hold of my shoulder and found out that he was &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib. &#8216;Ali invoked Allah&#8217;s Mercy for &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! You have not left behind you a person whose deeds I like to imitate and meet Allah with more than I like your deeds. By Allah! I always thought that Allah would keep you with your two companions, for very often I used to hear the Prophet saying, &#8216;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar went (somewhere); I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar entered (somewhere); and I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar went out.&#8221;&#8216;</p>

Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, (to Ibn &#8220;Abbas), &#8220;As for what you have said about the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with it from the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said to me &#8220;Open (the gate) and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was &#8216;Umar. I informed him of what the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me. &#8220;Open (the gate) for him and inform him of the glad tidings, of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him. &#8221; Behold !

The Prophet kept silent for a short while and then said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; Behold! It was &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan. &#8216;Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when &#8216;Uthman entered, he covered them (or it).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth said (to me), &#8220;What forbids you to talk to &#8216;Uthman about his brother Al-Walid because people have talked much about him?&#8221; So I went to &#8216;Uthman and when he went out for prayer I said (to him), &#8220;I have something to say to you and it is a piece of advice for you &#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O man, from you.&#8221; (Umar said: I see that he said, &#8220;I seek Refuge with Allah from you.&#8221;) So I left him and went to them. Then the messenger of Uthman came and I went to him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;Uthman asked, &#8220;What is your advice?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and revealed the Divine Book (i.e. Quran) to him; and you were amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle, and you participated in the two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina) and enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw his way. No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Did you receive your knowledge directly from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;And then Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and I was amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle and I believed in what ever he (i.e. the Prophet) was sent with, and participated in two migrations, as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance him. By Allah! I never disobeyed him, nor did I cheat him till Allah took him unto Him. Then I treated Abu Bakr and then &#8216;Umar similarly and then I was made Caliph. So, don&#8217;t I have rights similar to theirs?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Allah willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right.&#8221; Then he called &#8216;Ali and ordered him to flog him, and &#8216;Ali flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet we considered Abu Bakr as peerless and then &#8216;Umar and then &#8216;Uthman (coming next to him in superiority) and then we used not to differentiate between the companions of the Prophet</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the son of Muhib) An Egyptian who came and performed the Hajj to the Kaba saw some people sitting. He enquire, &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;They are the tribe of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man sitting amongst them?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Ibn Umar! I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that &#8216;Uthman fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The (Egyptian) man said, &#8220;Do you know that &#8216;Uthman was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&#8217; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &#8216;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&#8217;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &#8216;This is &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s hand.&#8217; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &#8216;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &#8216;Uthman.&#8217; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar said to the man, &#8216;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet said, &#8220;O Uhud ! Be calm.&#8221; I think that the Prophet hit it with his foot, adding, &#8220;For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and &#8216;Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &#8220;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &#8216;Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &#8220;Stand in straight lines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&#8217;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &#8216;Umar held the hand of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of &#8216;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &#8216;Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn &#8216;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al Mughira.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to &#8216;Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If the property of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &#8216;Adi bin Ka&#8217;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar then said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;Go to &#8216;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted &#8216;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar has come.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and &#8216;Umar asked (&#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &#8216;Aisha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &#8216;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar mentioned &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &#8216;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &#8216;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when &#8216;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar greeted (&#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he was buried, the group (recommended by &#8216;Umar) held a meeting. Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8221; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Ali.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to &#8216;Uthman,&#8221; Sad, &#8216;I give up my right to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali) kept silent. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &#8216;Ali) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &#8216;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &#8216;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&#8221; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him and bring him to me.&#8221; So when &#8216;Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&#8221;</p>

Then he said, &#8220;How could I remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,&#8221; or said, &#8220;A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership.&#8221; Suddenly came &#8216;Ali whom we did not expect. The people said, &#8220;This is &#8216;Ali.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.</p>

How (was this name given to &#8216;Ali)?&#8221; Sahl said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She said, &#8220;In the Mosque.&#8221; The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. Ali&#8217;s) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, &#8220;Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust).&#8221;</p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar mentioned his good deeds and said, &#8220;It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of the Prophet. Perhaps these facts have hurt you?&#8221; The questioner said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you or make you do things which you hate) !

Ali added &#8220;So the Prophet came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet said, &#8220;Remain at your place&#8221;. Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, &#8220;Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, &#8216;Allahu-Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and &#8216;Alhamdu-lillah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to say, &#8220;Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations.&#8221; In fact I used to keep close to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Quranic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&#8217;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&#8217;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&#8217; By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do,&#8221; Then &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&#8221; Then he (i.e. &#8216;Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &#8220;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle rather than to my own relatives&#8221; Abu Bark added: Look at Muhammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as &#8216;Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-&#8216;As bin Al-Rabi&#8217; (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Enemy cannot be the wives of one man.&#8221; So &#8216;Ali gave up that engagement.</p>

The Qa&#8217;if said.

The Prophet said, &#8216;If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand. But I would cut even the hand of Fatima (i.e. the daughter of the Prophet) if she committed a theft.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Hunting, Slaughtering</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.067.384"></a>Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, &#8220;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah&#8217;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Mi&#8217;rad. He said, &#8220;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi&#8217;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;If I let loose my trained hound after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If the hound eats of the game?&#8221; He said &#8220;Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?&#8221; He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat what they hunt for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if they killed (the game)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Even if they killed (the game).&#8221; I said, &#8216;We also hit (the game) with the Mi&#8217;rad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat of the animal which the Mi&#8217;rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi&#8217;rad.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maghaffal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, &#8220;Do not throw stones, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye.&#8221; Afterwards &#8216;Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, &#8220;I tell you that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;We hunt with the help of these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah&#8217;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&#8221; And it has also been narrated by &#8216;Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet &#8220;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;He can eat if he wishes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound.&#8221; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 395:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;We hunt with these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 397:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We provoked a rabbit at Marr Az-Zahran till it started jumping. My companions chased it till they got tired. But I alone ran after it and caught it and brought it to Abu Talha. He sent both its legs to the Prophet who accepted them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 398:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that once he was with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (on the way to Mecca). When he had covered some of the way to Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind the Prophet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rode his horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it. Some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked him about that. He said, &#8220;It was meal given to you by Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 399:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the same Hadith above, but he added); The Prophet asked, &#8220;Is there any of its meat left with you?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 400:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It is an onager.&#8217; They said, &#8220;It is what you have seen.&#8221; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &#8220;Hand to me my whip.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).&#8221; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &#8220;Come on, carry it!&#8221; But they said, &#8220;We will not even touch it.&#8221; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &#8220;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&#8221; When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &#8220;Has anything of it been left with you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out in a campaign and the army was called The Army of the Khabt, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida was our commander. We were struck with severe hunger. Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida took one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu &#8216;Ubaida to ambush a caravan of the Quraish. But we were struck with such severe hunger that we ate the Khabt (desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabt. Then the sea threw a huge fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so.</p>

Abu Musa was presented with a dish containing chicken. Among the people there was sitting a red-faced man who did not come near the food. Abu Musa said (to him), &#8220;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#8216; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#8216;I have nothing to mount you on&#8217; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked twice, &#8216;Where are Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#8217;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; He said, &#8216;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought a brother of mine to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him while the Prophet was in a sheep fold of his, and I saw him branding a sheep. (The sub-narrator said: I think Anas said, branding it on the ear.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rait&#8217; bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet, &#8220;We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (for slaughtering)&#8217; He said, &#8220;If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth or nail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221; The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were with the Prophet. on a journey, one of the camels ran away. A man shot it with an arrow and stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these camels some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away and you cannot catch it, then do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Sacrifice on Occasion of Birth (`Aqiqa)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.066.376"></a>Volume 7, Book 66, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A son was born to me and I took him to the Prophet who named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik for him with a date, invoked Allah to bless him and returned him to me. (The narrator added: That was Abu Musa&#8217;s eldest son.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A boy was brought to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him, but the boy urinated on him, whereupon the Prophet had water poured on the place of urine.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#8217;, and gave birth at Quba&#8217;. Then I brought the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, &#8220;How does my son fare?&#8221; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &#8220;He is quieter than he has ever been.&#8221; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), &#8220;Bury the child (as he&#8217;s dead).&#8221; Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Did you sleep with your wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.&#8221; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, &#8220;Yes, a few dates.&#8221; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#8217;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman bin &#8216;Amir Ad-Dabbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.&#8221; (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition &#8220;SUNNA&#8221;.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Ash-Shahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of &#8216;Aqiqa. I asked him and he said, &#8220;From Samura bin Jundab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (of camels or sheep) which the pagans used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. And Al-&#8216;Atira was (a sheep which was to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira) is permissible).&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (they got of camels or sheep) which they (pagans) used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. &#8216;Atira was (a sheep which used to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Give food to the hungry, pay a  visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his  ransom).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 287i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe  hunger), I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse from Allah&#8217;s Book to  me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for  a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle standing by my head. He said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira!&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Sadaik!&#8221; Then he held me by the hand, and made  me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and  ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, &#8220;Drink more, O Abu  Hirr!&#8221; So I drank again, whereupon he again said, &#8220;Drink more.&#8221; So I drank  more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met &#8216;Umar and  mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, &#8220;Somebody, who had more  right than you, O &#8216;Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me  while I knew it better than you.&#8221; On that Umar said to me, &#8220;By Allah, if I  admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a boy under the care of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and my hand  used to go around the dish while I was eating. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8216;O boy!  Mention the Name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat of the dish what is nearer  to you.&#8221; Since then I have applied those instructions when eating. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who was the son of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I ate a meal with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was eating  from all sides of the dish. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Eat of the dish what is  nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Wahb bin Kaisan Abi Nu&#8217;aim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his step-son,  &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama was with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Mention the Name of  Allah and eat of the dish what is nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 291: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tailor invited Allah&#8217;s Apostle to a meal which he had  prepared. I went along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him seeking to eat the pieces of gourd  from the various sides of the dish. Since that day I have liked to eat gourd. &#8216;Umar bin  Abi Salama said: The Prophet, said to me, &#8220;Eat with your right hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 292: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to love to start doing things from the  right side whenever possible, in performing ablution, putting on his shoes, and combing  his hair. (Al-Ash&#8217;ath said: The Prophet used to do so in all his affairs.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.065.293"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 293: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have heard the voice  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which was feeble, and I think that he is hungry. Have you got something  (to eat)?&#8221; She took out some loaves of barley bread, then took her face-covering  sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment and turned the  rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I went with that, and found  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked me, &#8220;Have you been sent by Abu Talha?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked,  &#8220;With some food (for us)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to  all those who were with him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (and all the people  accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then  said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not  have food enough to feed them all.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out till he met Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Abu Talha and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Um Sulaim ! Bring  whatever you have.&#8221; She brought that very bread. The Prophet ordered that it be  crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added,  &#8220;Admit ten (men).&#8221; So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Admit ten (more).&#8221; They were admitted, ate their full, and  went out. He then again said, &#8220;Admit ten more!&#8221; They were admitted, ate their  fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they  were eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 294: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the  Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;Have anyone of you any food with him?&#8221; It happened  that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turned into dough then. After a  while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet asked, &#8216;Will you sell us (a  sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?&#8221; The pagan said, &#8220;No, but I will sell it  &#8221; So the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet  ordered that the liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By  Allah, none of those one hundred and thirty men but had his share of those things. The  Prophet gave to those who were present, and also kept a share for those who were absent He  then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we all ate together our fill; yet there  remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 296: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu&#8217;man: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar, and when we  were at As-Sahba&#8217;, (Yahya, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;As-Sahba&#8217; is a place at a distance  of one day&#8217;s journey to Khaibar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked the people to bring their  food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed and ate of it.  Then the Prophet asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our  mouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he went with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to the house of Maimuna,  who was his and Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217; aunt. He found with her a roasted mastigure which her sister  Hufaida bint Al-Harith had brought from Najd. Maimuna presented the mastigure before  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who rarely started eating any (unfamiliar) food before it was described  and named for him. (But that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle stretched his hand towards the (meat of  the) mastigure whereupon a lady from among those who were present, said, &#8220;You should  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what you have presented to him. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is the  meat of a mastigure.&#8221; (On learning that) Allah&#8217;s Apostle withdrew his hand from the  meat of the mastigure. Khalid bin Al-Walid said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this unlawful  to eat?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, but it is not found in the land of my  people, so I do not like it.&#8221; Khalid said, &#8220;Then I pulled the mastigure (meat)  towards me and ate it while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was looking at me. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>who attended the Badr battle and was from the Ansar, that  he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have lost my eyesight and I  lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, the valley which is between me  and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in the  prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that I may  take it as a praying place. The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah willing, I will do that.&#8221;  The next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came with Abu Bakr. The  Prophet asked for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet had not sat till  he had entered the house and said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray in your  house?&#8221; I pointed at a place in my house whereupon he stood and said, &#8220;Allahu  Akbar.&#8221; We lined behind him and he prayed two Rakat and finished it with Taslim. We  then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A large  number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, &#8220;Where  is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&#8221; Another man said, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not  love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not say so. Do you not think  that he has said: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; seeking  Allah&#8217;s pleasure? The man said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better, but we have  always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to  be worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure. &#8221; </font></p>

When he reached As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared  Hais and placed it on a dining sheet. Then he sent me to invite men, who (came and) ate;  and that was his and Safiyya&#8217;s wedding banquet. Then the Prophet proceeded, and when he  saw (noticed) the mountain of Uhud, he said, &#8220;This mountain loves us, and we love  it.&#8221; When we approached Medina, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its  two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham has made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless their Mudd  and Sa (special kinds of measure).&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet asked for lunch, and he was presented  with bread and some extra food from the home-made Udm (e.g. soup).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Jew in Medina who used to lend me money up to  the season of plucking dates. (Jabir had a piece of land which was on the way to Ruma).  That year the land was not promising, so the payment of the debt was delayed one year. The  Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered nothing from my land. I asked him to  give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the Prophet whereupon he said  to his companions, &#8220;Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.&#8221; All of  them came to me in my garden, and the Prophet started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew  said, &#8220;O Abu Qasim! I will not grant him respite.&#8221; When the Prophet saw the  Jew&#8217;s attitude, he stood up and walked all around the garden and came again and talked to  the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and  put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, &#8220;Where is your hut, O  Jabir?&#8221; I informed him, and he said, &#8220;Spread out a bed for me in it.&#8221; I  spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him  again and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again  refused his request. Then the Prophet got up for the second time amidst the palm trees  loaded with fresh dates, and said, &#8220;O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.&#8221;  The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all his right,  yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded till I reached the  Prophet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, &#8220;I testify that I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When your servant brings your food  to you, if you do not ask him to join you, then at least ask him to take one or two  handfuls, for he has suffered from its heat (while cooking it) and has taken pains to cook  it nicely.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was an Ansari man nicknamed, Abu Shu&#8217;aib, who had a  slave who was a butcher. He came to the Prophet while he was sitting with his companions  and noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet . So he went to his butcher  slave and said, &#8220;Prepare for me a meal sufficient for five persons so that I may  invite the Prophet along with four other men.&#8221; He had the meal prepared for him and  invited him. A (sixth) man followed them. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Shu&#8217;aib! Another  man has followed us. If you wish, you may invite him; and if you wish, you may refuse  him.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;No, I will admit him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I know (about) the Hijab (the order of veiling of women)  more than anybody else. Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became the  bridegroom of Zainab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in  the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah&#8217;s Apostle remained sitting and  some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and  I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he  went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the  door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had  left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the  order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Supporting the Family</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.064.263"></a>Volume 7, Book 64, Number 263:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When a Muslim spends something on his family intending to receive Allah&#8217;s reward it is regarded as Sadaqa for him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 264:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;O son of Adam! Spend, and I shall spend on you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 265:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a Mujahid (warrior) who fights for Allah&#8217;s Cause, or like him who performs prayers all the night and fasts all the day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 266:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet visited me at Mecca while I was ill. I said (to him), &#8220;I have property; May I bequeath all my property in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa for you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. Anyhow Allah may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 267:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-&#8216;Amash:</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 268:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;The best alms is that which is given when one is rich, and a giving hand is better than a taking one, and you should start first to support your dependents.&#8217; A wife says, &#8216;You should either provide me with food or divorce me.&#8217; A slave says, &#8216;Give me food and enjoy my service.&#8221; A son says, &#8220;Give me food; to whom do you leave me?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Did you hear that from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, it is from my own self.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 269:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The best alms is that which you give when you are rich, and you should start first to support your dependants.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 270:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to sell the dates of the garden of Bani An-Nadir and store for his family so much food as would cover their needs for a whole year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 271:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I set out to visit &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, &#8220;Uthman AbdurRahman (bin &#8216;Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking permission (to meet you).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to &#8216;Umar &#8216;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; The group, &#8216;Uthman and his companions Sad, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8216;We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostles meant himself?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He did say so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;All and &#8216;Abbas and said. &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8221; They said, &#8216;Yes &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give to anybody else. And Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do all things.&#8217; (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah&#8217;s Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and both of you knew all about it then.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu- Bakr was so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I used to do the same with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&#8216;Ali) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &#8216;If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&#8217; So you both said, &#8216;Hand over this property to us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser so is it sinful of me to feed our children from his property?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No except if you take for your needs what is just and reasonable. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima went to the Prophet complaining about the bad effect of the stone hand-mill on her hand. She heard that the Prophet had received a few slave girls. But (when she came there) she did not find him, so she mentioned her problem to &#8216;Aisha. When the Prophet came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about that. &#8216;Ali added, &#8220;So the Prophet came to us when we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his arrival) but he said, &#8216;Stay where you are.&#8221; Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, &#8220;Shall I direct you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to bed say &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221;</p>

Shall I give it to poorer people than us?

<h3 align="center"><font>Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah) </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.001">Volume 7, Book 62, Number 1: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the  Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that,  they considered their worship insufficient and said, &#8220;Where are we from the Prophet  as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&#8221; Then one of them said, &#8220;I will  offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;I will fast  throughout the year and will not break my fast.&#8221; The third said, &#8220;I will keep  away from the women and will not marry forever.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to them and  said, &#8220;Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to  Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also  marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one  of my followers).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ursa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the Statement of Allah: &#8216;If you  fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other)  women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to  deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess.  That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O my  nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the  guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to  marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such  guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them  their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 3: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Alqama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was with Abdullah, &#8216;Uthman met him at Mina and  said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ! I have something to say to you.&#8221; So both of them  went aside and &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rah. man! Shall we marry you to a virgin  who will make you remember your past days?&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah felt that he was not in  need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Alqama!&#8221; Then I heard him  saying (in reply to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;As you have said that, (I tell you that) the Prophet  once said to us, &#8216;O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and  whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual  power. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no  wealth whatever. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O young people! Whoever among you can  marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his  private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to  marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We presented ourselves along with Ibn &#8216;Abbas at the funeral  procession of Maimuna at a place called Sarif. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This is the wife of  the Prophet so when you lift her bier, do not Jerk it or shake it much, but walk smoothly  because the Prophet had nine wives and he used to observe the night turns with eight of  them, and for one of them there was no night turn.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas asked me, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Marry, for the best person of this (Muslim) nation  (i.e., Muhammad) of all other Muslims, had the largest number of wives.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The rewards (of deeds) are  according to the intention, and everybody will get the reward for what he has intended. So  whoever emigrated for Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s sake, his emigration was for Allah and His  Apostle; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits, or to marry a woman, then his  emigration was for the thing for what he emigrated for.&#8221; (1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to fight in the holy battles in the company of the  Prophet and we had no wives with us. So we said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we get  castrated?&#8221; The Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 10: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came (from Mecca to Medina) and the  Prophet made a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; Al-Ansari. Al-Ansari  had two wives, so he suggested that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman take half, his wives and property.  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman replied, &#8220;May Allah bless you with your wives and property. Kindly show  me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market and gained (in bargains) some  dried yoghurt and some butter. After a few days the Prophet saw Abdur-Rahman with some  yellow stains on his clothes and asked him, &#8220;What is that, O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;I had married an Ansari woman.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;How much Mahr  did you give her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The weight of one (date) stone of gold.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Offer a banquet, even with one sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade &#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un to abstain from  marrying (and other pleasures) and if he had allowed him, we would have gotten ourselves  castrated.(1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, &#8220;Shall we get ourselves  castrated?&#8221; He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary  contract (2) and recited to us: &#8212; &#8216;O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things  which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.&#8217; (5.87) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a young man and I am  afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry.&#8221; He  kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same  (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth  time), and only then the Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after  writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself  castrated or not.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Suppose you landed in a  valley where there is a tree of which something has been eaten and then you found trees of  which nothing has been eaten, of which tree would you let your camel graze?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;(I will let my camel graze) of the one of which nothing has been eaten before.&#8221;  (The sub-narrator added: &#8216;Aisha meant that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not married a virgin  besides herself .) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to me), &#8220;You have been shown to  me twice in (my) dreams. A man was carrying you in a silken cloth and said to me, &#8216;This is  your wife.&#8217; I uncovered it; and behold, it was you. I said to myself, &#8216;If this dream is  from Allah, He will cause it to come true.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were returning from a Ghazwa (Holy Battle) with  the Prophet, I started driving my camel fast, as it was a lazy camel A rider came behind  me and pricked my camel with a spear he had with him, and then my camel started running as  fast as the best camel you may see. Behold! The rider was the Prophet himself. He said,  &#8216;What makes you in such a hurry?&#8221; I replied, I am newly married &#8221; He said,  &#8220;Did you marry a virgin or a matron? I replied, &#8220;A matron.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you marry a young girl so that you may play with her and she with  you?&#8221; When we were about to enter (Medina), the Prophet said, &#8220;Wait so that you  may enter (Medina) at night so that the lady of unkempt hair may comb her hair and the one  whose husband has been absent may shave her pubic region. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, any man who has a slave girl whom he  educates properly, teaches good manners, manumits and marries her, will get a double  reward And if any man of the people of the Scriptures believes in his own prophet and then  believes in me too, he will (also) get a double reward And any slave who fulfills his duty  to his master and to his Lord, will (also) get a double reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said: Abraham did not tell lies except three.  (One of them was) when Abraham passed by a tyrant and (his wife) Sara was accompanying him  (Abu Huraira then mentioned the whole narration and said:) (The tyrant) gave her Hajar.  Sara said, &#8220;Allah saved me from the hands of the Kafir (i.e. infidel) and gave me  Hajar to serve me.&#8221; (Abu Huraira added:) That (Hajar) is your mother, O Banu  Ma&#8217;-As-Sama&#8217; (i.e., the Arabs). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet stayed for three days between Khaibar and  Medina, and there he consummated his marriage to Safiyya bint Huyai. I invited the Muslims  to the wedding banquet in which neither meat nor bread was offered. He ordered for leather  dining-sheets to be spread, and dates, dried yoghurt and butter were laid on it, and that  was the Prophet&#8217;s wedding banquet. The Muslims wondered, &#8220;Is she (Saffiyya)  considered as his wife or his slave girl?&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;If he orders her to  veil herself, she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order  her to veil herself, she will be a slave girl. So when the Prophet proceeded from there,  he spared her a space behind him (on his she-camel) and put a screening veil between her  and the people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have come to give you myself in marriage (without Mahr).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  looked at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed his glance on her and then lowered his  head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat down. A man from his  companions got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If you are not in need of her, then  marry her to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got anything to offer?&#8221; The  man said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go  to your family and see if you have something.&#8221; The man went and returned, saying,  &#8220;No, by Allah, I have not found anything.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Go  again) and look for something, even if it is an iron ring.&#8221; He went again and  returned, saying, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron  ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&#8221; He had no rida. He added, &#8220;I give half  of it to her.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What will she do with your Izar? If you  wear it, she will be naked, and if she wears it, you will be naked.&#8221; So that man sat  down for a long while and then got up (to depart). When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him going, he  ordered that he be called back. When he came, the Prophet said, &#8220;How much of the  Quran do you know?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I know such Sura and such Sura,&#8221; counting  them. The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you know them by heart?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go, I marry her to you for that much of the Quran  which you have.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Hudhaifa bin &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a bin Abdi Shams who had  witnessed the battle of Badr along with the Prophet adopted Salim as his son, to whom he  married his niece, Hind bint Al-Walid bin &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a; and Salim was the freed slave  of an Ansar woman, just as the Prophet had adopted Zaid as his son. It was the custom in  the Pre-lslamic Period that if somebody adopted a boy, the people would call him the son  of the adoptive father and he would be the latter&#8217;s heir.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha regarding the Verse: &#8216;If you fear that  you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans (4.3) She said, &#8220;O my nephew!  This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the guardianship of her guardian who  likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails her Mahr. Such  guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving them their  full Mahr, and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning the women . . . whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them  that if the orphan girl had beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her  family status. They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had  no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them  and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them,  they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them  justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, &#8216;If at all there is evil omen, it is in  the horse, the woman and the house.&#8221; a lady is to be warded off. And the Statement of  Allah: &#8216;Truly, among your wives and your children, there are enemies for you (i.e may stop  you from the obedience of Allah)&#8217; (64.14) </font></p>

When the Prophet saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was  called (for him), and he said to the man, &#8220;How much of the Quran do you know (by  heart)?&#8221; The man replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),&#8221; naming the  Suras The Prophet said, &#8220;I have married her to you for what you know of the Quran  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;When Hafsa bint &#8216;Umar  became a widow after the death of (her husband) Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi who had been  one of the companions of the Prophet, and he died at Medina. I went to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan  and presented Hafsa (for marriage) to him. He said, &#8220;I will think it over.&#8217; I waited  for a few days, then he met me and said, &#8216;It seems that it is not possible for me to marry  at present.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him,  &#8216;If you wish, I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not  say anything to me in reply. I became more angry with him than with &#8216;Uthman. I waited for  a few days and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him.  Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented  Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Nothing  stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned  her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. And if Allah&#8217;s Apostle  had refused her, I would have accepted her.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Habiba said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;We have heard that  you want to marry Durra bint Abu-Salama.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Can she be  married along with Um Salama (her mother)? Even if I have not married Um Salama, she would  not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother.&#8221; &#8216;And there is no  blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.&#8217; (2.235) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Hint your intention of  marrying&#8217; is made by saying (to the widow) for example: &#8220;I want to marry, and I wish  that Allah will make a righteous lady available for me.&#8217; &#8221; Al-Qasim said: One may say  to the widow: &#8216;I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring  you much good, or something similar &#8216;Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should  not declare it openly. One may say: &#8216;I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to  Allah; you are fit to remarry.&#8217; She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what  you say,&#8217; but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to  somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the  Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they  are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid). </font></p>

It was about the female orphan under the protection of her  guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry her with a little  or reduced Mahr. So such guardians were forbidden to marry female orphans unless they deal  with them justly and give their full Mahr; and they were ordered to marry women other than  them.&#8221;&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(Later) the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, for instructions,  and then Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . And yet  whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a  female orphan had wealth and beauty, they desired to marry her and were interested in her  noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if she was not desired by them because of  her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married some other woman. So, as they  used to leave her when they had no interest in her, they had no right to marry her if they  had the desire to do so, unless they deal justly with her and gave her a full amount of  Mahr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was (sitting) among the people in the company of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle a woman stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She has given herself  in marriage to you; please give your opinion of her.&#8221; The Prophet did not give her  any reply. She again stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She has given herself (in  marriage) to you; so please give your opinion of her. The Prophet did not give her any  reply. She again stood up for the third time and said, &#8220;She has given herself in  marriage to you: so give your opinion of her.&#8221; So a man stood up and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Marry her to me.&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Have you got  anything?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and search for  something, even if it were an iron ring.&#8221; The man went and searched and then returned  saying, &#8220;I could not find anything, not even an iron ring.&#8221; Then the Prophet  said, &#8220;Do you know something of the Quran (by heart)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I know  (by heart) such Sura and such Sura.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go! I have married her  to you for what you know of the Quran (by heart).&#8221; </font></p>

The  Muslims asked whether Safiyya would be considered as his wife or as a slave girl of what  his right hands possessed. Then they said, &#8220;If the Prophet screens her from the  people, then she Is the Prophet&#8217;s wife but if he does not screen her, then she is a slave  girl.&#8221; So when the Prophet proceeded, he made a place for her (on the camel) behind  him and screened her from people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Whenever the Prophet passed by (my mother Um-Sulaim)  he used to enter her and greet her. Anas further said: Once the Prophet way a bridegroom  during his marriage with Zainab, Um Sulaim said to me, &#8220;Let us give a gift to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Do it.&#8221; So she prepared Haisa (a sweet dish)  made from dates, butter and dried yoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him  and he said, &#8220;Put it down,&#8221; and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and  to invite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I  found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa  and saying over it whatever Allah wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches  of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, &#8220;Mention the Name of Allah, and each man  should eat of the dish the nearest to him.&#8221; When all of them had finished their  meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy. Then  the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after  him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling  place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting  the Verses:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s house until leave is given you  for a meal, (and then) not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you are  invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse without sitting for a talk.  Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go),  but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.&#8217; (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas said,  &#8220;I served the Prophet for ten years.&#8221; </font></p>

It was  revealed for the first time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab  bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to  a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet  for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that  those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the  threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then,  he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were  still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with  him. When we reached the threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place, he thought that they had  left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had  left. Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were  revealed. </font></p>

And I advise you to take care of the  women, for they are created from a rib and the most crooked portion of the rib is its  upper part; if you try to straighten it, it will break, and if you leave it, it will  remain crooked, so I urge you to take care of the women.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted  that they would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands. The first one said,  &#8220;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is kept on the top of a  mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one might put up  with the trouble of fetching it.&#8221; The second one said, &#8220;I shall not relate my  husband&#8217;s news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe  him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits.&#8221; The third one said, &#8220;My  husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if  I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&#8221; The fourth one  said, &#8220;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot  nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&#8221; The fifth one  said, &#8220;My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a  lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221; The sixth one said, &#8220;If  my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves  nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not  stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221; The seventh  one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are  present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221; The eighth one  said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of  good smelling grass).&#8221; The ninth one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man  wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are abundant and his house is near  to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221; The tenth one said, &#8220;My husband is  Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond  and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home  (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When  the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going  to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221; The eleventh one said, &#8220;My husband is Abu Zar  and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments  and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become  fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He  found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought  me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain .  Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the  morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what  may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of  provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four  months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her  father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of  her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not  waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our  house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out  at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had  two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me  and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse  and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of  livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221;  She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the  smallest utensil of Abu Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I  am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two  ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said &#8216;If you two (wives of  the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so  inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till &#8216;Umar performed the Hajj and I  too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call  of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when  &#8216;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he  performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the  two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &#8216;If you two  (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to  oppose what the Prophet likes)?&#8221; (66.4) He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your  question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar went on narrating the  Hadith and said, &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who  used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day  and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day  regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the  same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but  when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so  our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she  retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &#8216;Why  are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer  him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the  night.&#8217; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&#8217; Then  I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;Does anyone of  you keep the Prophet angry till night?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;You are a ruined losing  person! Don&#8217;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus  you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do  not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your  neighbor (i.e., &#8216;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved  to the Prophet .&#8221; Umar added,&#8221;At that time a talk was circulating among us that  (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on  the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door  violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8216;Today a great thing has happened.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan  come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that:  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;The Prophet kept away from his  wives and I said &#8220;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&#8217; I had already thought that most probably  this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the  morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed  there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&#8217; She said, &#8216;I do not  know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&#8217; I came out and sat near the pulpit and  saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for  a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet;  was and said to a black slave of his, &#8216;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for  &#8216;Umar (to enter)?&#8217; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned  saying, &#8216;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&#8217; Then I  returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear  the situation and once again I said to the slave, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; So I returned  again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the  situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned to me saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; When I  was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &#8216;The Prophet has given you permission.&#8217;  Then I entered upon Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm  leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and  he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while  still standing I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He looked at me  and said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah Akbar!&#8217; And then, while still standing, I said chatting,  &#8216;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power  over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were  overpowered by their women.&#8217; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &#8216;Will you heed  what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;Do not be  tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more  beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him  smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see  anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made  prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not  worship Allah.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &#8216;Are you of  such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the  rewards for their good deeds in this world.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah to  forgive me.&#8217; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the  story which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &#8216;I will not enter upon  them (my wives) for one month,&#8217; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had  admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon  &#8216;Aisha. &#8216;Aisha said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter  upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting  them one by one.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha  added, &#8216;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he  asked me first, and I chose him.&#8217; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said  what &#8216;Aisha had said . &#8221; (1) The Prophet, &#8216; had decided to abstain from eating a  certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of  his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one  month. See Quran: (66.4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the sun eclipsed.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) and so did the people along with him.  He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been  recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long  time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur&#8217;an). Then he  performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the period of the first  bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period  of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of  a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser  duration than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than  the first, and then he again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer.  By then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are  two signs among the signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of the death or birth  of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember Allah (offer the eclipse  prayer).&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you stretching your  hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck  a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this  world exists. Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible  sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women.&#8221; The people  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the reason for that?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was said. &#8220;Do they disbelieve in  Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;They are not thankful to  their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one  of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, &#8220;I have  never seen any good from you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One morning we saw the wives of the Prophet weeping, and  everyone of them had her family with her, I went to the mosque and found that it was  crowded with people. Then &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came and went up to the Prophet who was in  his upper room. He greeted him but nobody answered. He greeted again, but nobody answered.  Then the gatekeeper called him and he entered upon the Prophet, and asked, &#8220;Have you  divorced your wives?&#8221; The Prophet, said, &#8220;No, but I have taken an oath not to go  to them for one month.&#8221; So the Prophet stayed away (from his wives) for twenty nine  days and then entered upon them. </font></p>

He greeted Hafsa and then  proceeded (beside her) till they dismounted (on the way). &#8216;Aisha missed him, and so, when  they dismounted, she put her legs in the Idhkhir and said, &#8220;O Lord (Allah)!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any  slave or anything else except a camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I  used to feed his horse with fodder and drew water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and  prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to  bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry the date stones on my  head from Zubair&#8217;s land given to him by Allah&#8217;s Apostle and this land was two third  Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones  on my head, I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then,  (directing his camel to kneel down) said, &#8220;Ikh! Ikh!&#8221; so as to make me ride  behind him (on his camel). I felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and  his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came to Az-Zubair and said,  &#8220;I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, and he  had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I  felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the  Prophet in such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him.&#8221; (I  continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse,  whereupon I felt as if he had set me free. </font></p>

Then the Divine Inspiration was revealed to him and when that state was over,  he (the Prophet was saying: &#8220;O women! You have been allowed by Allah to go out for  your needs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My foster uncle came and asked permission (to enter) but I  refused to admit him till I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that.

I have been suckled  by a woman and not by a man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is your uncle, so let  him enter upon you.&#8221; And that happened after the order of Al-Hijab (compulsory  veiling) was revealed. All things which become unlawful because of blood relations are  unlawful because of the corresponding foster suckling relations. </font></p>

Then he had sexual relations with them but none of them delivered  any child except one who delivered a half person.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people differed about the type of treatment which had  been given to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. So they asked Sahl bin  Sad As-Sa&#8217;id who was the only surviving Companion (of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied,  &#8220;Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima was washing the blood  off his face and &#8216;Ali was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of date-palm leaves  was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas answering a man who asked him, &#8220;Did  you attend the prayer of &#8216;Id al Adha or &#8216;Id-al-Fitr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas  replied, &#8220;Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship with him, I could not  have offered it.&#8221; (That was because of his young age). Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He  added, &#8220;Then the Prophet went to the women and instructed them and gave them  religious advice and ordered them to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands  to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it)  towards Bilal. Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his house . &#8221; </font></p>

Then the Prophet asked Um Salama, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He is Dihya (al-Kalbi).&#8221; When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah, I did not take him for anybody other than him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet wherein he informed about the news of Gabriel.&#8221; The subnarrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman: From whom have you heard that? Abu &#8216;Uthman said: From Usama bin Zaid.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la used to say, &#8220;I wish I could see Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely.&#8221; When the Prophet was at Al-Ja&#8217;rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?&#8221; The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. &#8216;Umar pointed out to Ya&#8217;la, telling him to come. Ya&#8217;la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet&#8217;s face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked me about &#8216;Umra a while ago?&#8221; The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), &#8220;As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your &#8216;Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), &#8220;Umar has come to me and said: &#8220;Casualties were heavy among the Qurra&#8217; of the! Qur&#8217;an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra&#8217; on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur&#8217;an be collected.&#8221; I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, that is a good project. &#8220;Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which &#8216;Umar had realized.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr said (to me). &#8216;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur&#8217;an and collect it in one book).&#8221; By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How will you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;By Allah, it is a good project.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. So I started looking for the Qur&#8217;an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa&#8217; (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur&#8217;an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with &#8216;Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, so he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Quran) as Jews and the Christians did before.&#8221; So &#8216;Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, &#8220;Send us the manuscripts of the Qur&#8217;an so that we may compile the Qur&#8217;anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.&#8221; Hafsa sent it to &#8216;Uthman. &#8216;Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. &#8216;Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur&#8217;an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur&#8217;an was revealed in their tongue.&#8221; They did so, and when they had written many copies, &#8216;Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. &#8216;Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur&#8217;anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, &#8220;A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur&#8217;an and I used to hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): &#8216;Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.&#8217; (33.23)</p>

He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?&#8221; So, instead of the above Verse, the following Verse was revealed:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, &#8220;Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught it to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have told a lie, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.&#8221; So I dragged him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven&#8217;t taught me!&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Release him, (O &#8216;Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!&#8221; Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Recite, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; I recited it as he had taught me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way. This Qur&#8217;an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).&#8221;</p>

(Be informed) that the first thing that was revealed thereof was a Sura from Al-Mufassal, and in it was mentioned Paradise and the Fire. When the people embraced Islam, the Verses regarding legal and illegal things were revealed. If the first thing to be revealed was: &#8216;Do not drink alcoholic drinks.&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;We will never leave alcoholic drinks,&#8217; and if there had been revealed, &#8216;Do not commit illegal sexual intercourse, &#8216;they would have said, &#8216;We will never give up illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; While I was a young girl of playing age, the following Verse was revealed in Mecca to Muhammad: &#8216;Nay! But the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.&#8217; (54.46) Sura Al-Baqara (The Cow) and Surat An-Nisa (The Women) were revealed while I was with him.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha took out the copy of the Qur&#8217;an for the man and dictated to him the Verses of the Suras (in their proper order) .</p>

He asked again, but he did not answer. He asked for the third time!, but he did not answer. On that, &#8216;Umar said to himself, &#8220;May your mother lose you!

After a little while I heard a call maker calling me, I said, &#8216;I was afraid that some Qur&#8217;anic Verse might be revealed about me.&#8217; So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greeted him. He said, &#8216;Tonight there has been revealed to me a Surah which is dearer to me than that on which the sun shines (i.e. the world).&#8217; Then he recited: &#8216;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 569:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;an to me.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Shall I recite (the Qur&#8217;an) to you while it has been revealed to you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I like to hear it from others.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 570:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to me, &#8220;Recite (the Quran) to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Shall I recite (the Qur&#8217;an) to you while it has been revealed to you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So I recited Surat-An-Nisa&#8217; (The Women), but when I recited the Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people.&#8217; (4.41) He said, &#8220;Enough for the present,&#8221; I looked at him and behold! His eyes were overflowing with tears</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 571:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sufyan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shubruma said, &#8220;I wanted to see how much of the Qur&#8217;an can be enough (to recite in prayer) and I could not find a Surah containing less than three Verses, therefore I said to myself), &#8220;One ought not to recite less than three (Quranic) Verses (in prayer).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud: The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody recites the last two Verses of Surat al-Baqara at night, it will be sufficient for him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 572:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, &#8220;What a wonderful man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.&#8221; When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, &#8220;Let me meet him.&#8221; Then I met him and he asked me, &#8220;How do you fast?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I fast daily,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Quran?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I finish it every night.&#8221; On that he said, &#8220;Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;an (and finish it) in one month.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I have power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then fast for three days per week.&#8221; I said, &#8220;i have the power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur&#8217;an In seven days.&#8221; I wish I had accepted the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is said that &#8216;Abdullah used to recite one-seventh of the Qur&#8217;an during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Amr:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;In the last days (of the world) there will appear young people with foolish thoughts and ideas. They will give good talks, but they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out of its game, their faith will not exceed their throats. So, wherever you find them, kill them, for there will be a reward for their killers on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;There will appear some people among you whose prayer will make you look down upon yours, and whose fasting will make you look down upon yours, but they will recite the Qur&#8217;an which will not exceed their throats (they will not act on it) and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the game whereupon the archer would examine the arrowhead but see nothing, and look at the unfeathered arrow but see nothing, and look at the arrow feathers but see nothing, and finally he suspects to find something in the lower part of the arrow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 579:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer who recites the Qur&#8217;an and acts on it, like a citron which tastes nice and smells nice. And the example of a believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an but acts on it, is like a date which tastes good but has no smell. And the example of a hypocrite who recites the Qur&#8217;an is like a Raihana (sweet basil) which smells good but tastes bitter And the example of a hypocrite who does not recite the Quran is like a colocynth which tastes bitter and has a bad smell.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 580:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as you agree about its interpretation, but if you have any difference of opinion (as regards to its interpretation and meaning) then you should stop reciting it (for the time being).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard a man reciting a Quranic Verse which he had heard the Prophet reciting in a different way. So he took that man to the Prophet (and told him the story). The Prophet said, &#8220;Both of you are reciting in a correct way, so carry on reciting.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;The nations which were before you were destroyed (by Allah) because they differed.&#8221;</p>
