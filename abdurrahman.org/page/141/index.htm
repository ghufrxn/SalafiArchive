		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam <strong>Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</strong> (d.751H)<br>
Source : Kitaabur-Rooh<em> (p. 44)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul (<i>ar-rooh</i>) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Its connection to the body as a fetus in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Its connection to the body after a person is born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Its connection to the body in <i>al-Barzakh</i> (the period between a person’s death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are <i>ahaadeeth </i>and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person’s soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Kathir<br>
</strong>Tafsir Ibn Katheer (Abridged) Volume 9<br>
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.  (It is) like a rain (Ghayth), thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.  But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221; [57:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted degrades the significance of this life and belittles it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this is the significance of this life to its people, just as He said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land.  This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.&#8221; ( 3:14 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Like a rain (Ghayth),&#8221; which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair.  Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And He is it Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.&#8221; (42:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;&#8221; meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain.  And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green.  After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust.  This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble.  This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning.  In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome.  Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens.  They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and gray hair.  He creates what He wills.  And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.&#8221; (30:54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming.  Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it.  Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it.  Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap of his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; [Ahmad 1:387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri [Fath al-Bari 11:328].  This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind.  If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions.  By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.&#8221; (3:133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.  That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with.  And Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, &#8220;This, that Allah has qualified them for, is all a part of His favor, bounty and compassion.&#8221;  We mentioned a Hadith collected in the Sahih in which the poor emigrants said to the Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!  The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;They pray like us and fast as we do.  However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and they free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.&#8221;  The Prophet, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, &#8220;Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? None would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same.  Say, &#8220;Glorious is Allah,&#8221; Allah is Most Great&#8221;, and &#8220;Praise be to Allah&#8221;, thirty three times each after every prayer.&#8221;  They later came back and said, &#8220;Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the favor that He gives to whom He wills.&#8221; [Muslim 1:416]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Gardens of perpetual bliss &#8211; they shall enter them, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses and their offspring. And angels shall enter upon them every gate.&#8221; [ar-Ra`d, 13:23 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is a reminder. Verily, for the righteous is a beautiful place of [final] return &#8211; gardens of eternity, whose doors will [always] be open to them.&#8221; [Saad, 38:49-50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds, until behold, they arrive there. Its gates will be opened, and its keepers will say, &#8216;Peace be upon you!&#8217; Well have you done, do enter it, abiding [in it] eternally.&#8221; [Az-Zumar, 39:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa`d reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8221; Paradise has eight gates, and one of them is called ar-Rayyaan, through which none will enter but those who observe fasting.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever spends two things in the way of Allah will be called from the gates of Paradise and will be addressed, &#8216;Oh slave of Allah, here is prosperity!&#8217; So whoever was among the people who used to offer their prayers will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was among the people who used to participate in jihad will be called from the gate of jihad; and whoever was among those who used to observer fasts will be called from the gate of ar-Rayyaan;<br>
and whoever was among those who used to give charity will be called from the gate of charity.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you, oh Allah&#8217;s Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will be called from those gates. Will there be anyone who will be called from all these gates?&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be one of them.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqba ibn `Aamir said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were entrusted with the task of tending the camels. On my turn, when I came back in the evening after grazing them in the pastures, I found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) stand and address the people. I heard these words of his, &#8216;If any Muslim performs ablution well, then stands and prays two rak`ahs, setting about them with his heart as well as his face, Paradise will be guaranteed to him.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What a fine thing this is!&#8217; A narrator who was before me said, &#8216;The first was even better than this.&#8217; When I cast a glance, I saw that it was `Umar who said, &#8216;I see that you have just come and observed. If anyone among you performs the ablution, completes the ablution well and says, &#8220;I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the servant of Allah and His Messenger,&#8221; then the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The gates of Paradise will be opened on Monday and on Thursdays, and every servant [of Allah] who associates nothing with Allah will be forgiven, except for the man who has a grudge against his brother. [About them] it will be said, &#8216;Delay these two until they are reconciled. Delay these two until they are reconciled. Delay these two until they are reconciled.'&#8221; [Muslim, Maalik, Abu Dawood]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden, abiding in it eternally.&#8221; [2:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There, no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shay they [ever] be evicted.&#8221; [15:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will not taste death therein, except the first death, and He will preserve them from the penalty of the Blazing Fire. [It will be] a bounty from your Lord. That will be the supreme achievement!&#8221; [44:56-57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for those who believe and work righteous deeds, they will have the gardens of Paradise as hospitality. Eternally therein, they will not desire any other [place].&#8221; [18:107-108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Their Lord gives them glad tidings of a mercy from Himself and good pleasure and of gardens for them wherein is lasting enjoyment.&#8221; [9:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah reported that Allah’s Apostle (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who gets into Paradise [will be made to enjoy such an everlasting] bliss that he will neither become destitute nor will his clothes wear out nor will his youthfulness decline.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree and Abu Hurayrah both narrated that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There will be an announcer [in Paradise] who will make this announcement, ‘Verily, there is in store for you [everlasting] health. You will never fall ill, and you will live [forever] and never die. You will remain young and never grow old. You will always live in affluent circumstances and never become destitute.’ [This is explained in] the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, ‘And it will be announced to them, ‘This is the Paradise you have been made to inherit for what you used to do.’’[7:43]&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`eed reported that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a white-colored ram.&#8221; [Abu Kuraib made the addition, &#8220;Then it will be made to stand between Paradise and Hell.&#8221; So far as the rest of the hadeeth is concerned, there is perfect agreement between narrators.] &#8220;It will be said to the people of Paradise, ‘Do you recognize this?’ They will raise up their necks, look towards it and say, ‘Yes, it is death.’ Then a command will be given to slaughter it, and it will be said, ‘O people of Paradise, there is everlasting life for you and no death.’ Then [addressing] the people of Hellfire, it will be said, ‘O people of Hellfire, there is everlasting life for you and no death.’&#8221; Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) then recited the following verse pointing wit his hand to this [material] world: &#8220;Warn them of the day of regret, when their affairs will be decided. They are unmindful, and they do not believe.&#8221; [19:39] [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It will be said to the people of Paradise, ‘O people of Paradise, eternity [for you] and no death!’ To the people of the Fire [it will be said], ‘O people of the Fire, eternity [for you] and no death!’&#8221; [Al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Road to Paradise<br>
Dr. `Abdullah al-Shimemeri</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Descriptions of Paradise from the Qur&#8217;aan and Hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly the ultimate goal of every Muslim is Paradise. As with all aspects of the Unseen, it can be only imagined through analogy, yet its realities are far beyond description in any human language. Allah (subhaanahu wa ta`aala) has prepared for His servants, &#8220;what no eye has seen and no ear has heard and has never occurred to a human heart.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others] This eternal home is not limited to what is described here of material and spiritual enjoyments, for it includes &#8220;all the soul has longed for&#8221; and finally, the greatest and most complete pleasure beyond all imagination &#8211; the presence and nearness of the Creator Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who are the inheritors of such blessing? Who are the souls worthy of such reward?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is common belief among Muslims today that anyone who professes &#8220;La Ilaha ill-Allah&#8221; and &#8220;Muhammadun Rasoolullah&#8221; will enter Paradise. Yet this testimony is more than a statement of the tongue. It is an oath, a commitment that must be fulfilled. It has conditions and requirements which affect all aspects of life. It concerns authority &#8211; what actually governs our behavior and deeds. The Arabs of Quraish who refused to pronounce this kalimah did so because they fully understood its implications. Yet Muslims repeat it today without a second thought, their actions and lifestyles bearing witness to something totally different. And they expect Paradise!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Qur&#8217;aan, Allah (swt) has warned against complacency in religion like that of the Jews and Christians who mistakenly claim that God has favored them over others and that Paradise is theirs alone: &#8220;It is not by your wishes, nor the wishes of the People of the Scriptures. Whoever does a wrong shall be punished for it, and he will not find other than Allah as a protector or helper.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet many of today&#8217;s Muslims consider themselves a chosen people, while neglecting the commands of their Lord, turning their backs on the sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him) and insisting on a secular life far from the blessings of divine law&#8230; perhaps even going so far as to deny certain aspects of that law. Customs and traditions, materialism, man-made social systems, national leaders and even their own inclinations are now sharing the authority which rightfully belongs exclusively to our Creator, Owner of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward of Paradise is too great not to have a price. That price is true faith which is proven by obedience to Allah and His Messenger. The Qur&#8217;aan states, &#8220;And whoever desires the Hereafter and exerts the effor due to it while being a believer &#8211; those are the ones whose effort is appreciated [by Allah].&#8221; [17:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must return to the Qur&#8217;aan, not simply in an emotional or academic manner, but with a sense of instruction for obedience and action. We must find out what kind of people Allah has asked us to be and then become as such. This is the road to Paradise.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In both The Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, janazah prayer is conducted after almost every congregational prayer. Learn this prayer before you leave for The Holy Land so that there will be greater depth to your participation in this prayer]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the manner of performing Funeral Prayer?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The manner of performing Funeral Prayer is that the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) begins by pronouncing <strong>Takbirat-ul-Ihram</strong> (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) and <strong>seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recites the <strong>Basmalah</strong> (saying, &#8220;Bismillah Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim [In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful]&#8221;) and <strong>Al-Fatihah</strong> (the opening chapter of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an, Surah number I). It is desirable that he recites a short Surah after Al-Fatihah, such as <strong>Al-Ikhlas or Al-`Asr</strong>, or some Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses). It was authentically related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) which indicates this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Imam should pronounce the <strong>second Takbir</strong> (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) and invoke Allah&#8217;s <strong>peace upon the Prophet</strong>(peace be upon him) in the same manner a person invokes Allah&#8217;s peace upon him in the final Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam pronounces the <strong>third Takbir</strong> and supplicates to Allah for the deceased with the well-known supplications (of the Prophet), being attentive to mentioning the correct gender and plural pronouns for multiple funerals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the Imam pronounces the <strong>fourth Takbir</strong> followed by a moment of silence and then recites Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) once to his right only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opening invocation, there is no harm in either saying it or not. Yet it is better to omit it in accordance with the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a style="color:blue;" name="Hastenthefuneralproceedings"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="112424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Hasten the funeral proceedings&#8230;</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;"></b><b>Q: Would you please explain to us how should the Funeral Prayer be performed</b><b> as reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him), </b>because many people do not know how it should be performed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A</strong>: The manner of performing Funeral Prayer was demonstrated by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) as follows: It begins with pronouncing Takbirat-ul-Ihram and seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan. Then, the Imam recites the Basmalah and Al-Fatihah followed by a short Surah or some Ayahs. Then, he pronounces Takbir and invokes Allah&#8217;s peace upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) as one does at the end of the Prayer. Then, he pronounces a third Takbir and supplicates to Allah for the deceased.</p>
<p>The best is to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><a style="color:#008000;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></a><a style="color:#008000;" name="OAllah,forgiveourlivingand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="26344" class="tip"></span>O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, those who are present among us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our males and our females. O Allah, whoever You decree to live, let him live in Islam and whoever You cause to die, cause him to die withIman (Faith). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honor the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water, snow and hail, and cleanse him of sins as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family. O Allah, admit him to Paradise and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of Hell-fire; make his grave spacious and fill it with light. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward and do not cause us to go astray after this.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was recorded from the Prophet (peace be upon him). If you supplicate to Allah using other words, this is fine. For example, one may say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allah, if he was a doer of good, then increase his good deeds; and if he was a wrongdoer, then forgive his bad deeds. O Allah, forgive him and give him the strength to say the right thing.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, after a fourth Takbir there is a short pause ending with one Taslim to the right. This was narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of Sunnah (action following the teachings of the Prophet) that the Imam stands at the head of the body if the deceased is a male and by its middle if it is the body of a female as authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anas </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Samurah ibn Jundub </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both). As for the opinion held by some scholars that it is prescribed in the Sunnah that the Imam stands at the chest of the body if the deceased is a male, this is a weak opinion that has no basis as far as we know. When performing Funeral Prayer, the dead body should be positioned facing the direction of the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><span style="color:#008000;"><a style="color:#008000;" name="ItistheQiblah(Kabah-direction"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112426" class="tip"></span>It is the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer) of Muslims while living i.e. during Prayer and after death [in the grave].</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></span> May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p><strong>For the deceased in the funeral prayer:</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">[Note: The following  are for funeral of a male Muslim, change it accordingly for female Muslimah]</span></em></p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمِّ اغْفِرْ لِحَيِّنا وَمَيِّتِنا وَشاهِدِنا ، وَغائِبِنا ، وَصَغيرِنا وَكَبيرِنا ، وَذَكَرِنا وَأُنْثانا. اللهُمِّ مَنْ أَحْيَيْتَهُ مِنّا فَأَحْيِهِ عَلى الإِسْلام ،وَمَنْ تَوَفَّيْتَهُ مِنّا فَتَوَفَّهُ عَلى الإِيمان ، اللهُمِّ لا تَحْرِمْنا أَجْرَه ، وَلا تُضِلَّنا بَعْدَه</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahum-maghfir lihayyinaa, wa mayyitinaa, wa shaahidinaa, wa ghaa&#8217;ibinaa, wa sagheerinaa wa kabeerinaa, wa thakarinaa wa &#8216;unthaanaa.

<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, those who are with us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our menfolk and our womenfolk. O Allah, whomever you give life from among us give him life in Islam, and whomever you take way from us take him away in Faith. O Allah, do not forbid us their reward and do not send us astray after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Majah 1/480, Ahmad 2/368. See also Al-Albani, Sahih Ibn Majah 1/251.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمِّ اغْفِرْ لَهُ وَارْحَمْه ، وَعافِهِ وَاعْفُ عَنْه ، وَأَكْرِمْ نُزُلَه ، وَوَسِّعْ مُدْخَلَه ، وَاغْسِلْهُ بِالْماءِ وَالثَّلْجِ وَالْبَرَدْ ، وَنَقِّهِ مِنَ الْخطايا كَما نَقّيْتَ الثَّوْبُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الدَّنَسْ ، وَأَبْدِلْهُ داراً خَيْراً مِنْ دارِه ، وَأَهْلاً خَيْراً مِنْ أَهْلِه ، وَزَوْجَاً خَيْراً مِنْ زَوْجِه ، وَأَدْخِلْهُ الْجَنَّة ، وَأَعِذْهُ مِنْ عَذابِ القَبْر وَعَذابِ النّار</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahum-maghfir lahu warhamhu, wa &#8216;aafihi, wa&#8217;fu &#8216;anhu, wa &#8216;akrim nuzulahu, wa wassi&#8217; mudkhalahu, waghsilhu bilmaa&#8217;i waththalji walbaradi, wa naqqihi minal-khataayaa kamaa naqqaytath-thawbal-&#8216;abyadha minad-danasi, wa &#8216;abdilhu daaran khayran min daarihi, wa &#8216;ahlan khayran min &#8216;ahlihi, wa zawjan khayran min zawjihi, wa &#8216;adkhilhul-jannata, wa. &#8216;a&#8217;ithhu min &#8216;athaabil-qabri[wa &#8216;athaabin-naar].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him and give him strength and pardon him. Be generous to him and cause his entrance to be wide and wash him with water and snow and hail. Cleanse him of his transgressions as white cloth is cleansed of stains. Give him an abode better than his home, and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife. Take him into Paradise and protect him from the punishment of the grave [and from the punishment of Hell-fire].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheeh Muslim 2/663.</p>
<p><strong>The funeral prayer for deceased child:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمَّ أَعِذْهُ مِن عَذَابِ القَبْرِ<br>
اللهُـمِّ اجْعَلْـهُ فَرَطـاً وَذُخْـراً لِوالِـدَيهِ، وَشَفـيعاً مُجَـاباً، اللهُـمِّ ثَـقِّلْ بِهِ مَوازيـنَهُما، وَأَعْـظِمْ بِهِ أُجُـورَهُـما، وَأَلْـحِقْـهُ بِصَالِـحِ الـمؤْمِنـين، وَاجْعَلْـهُ في كَِفـَالَةِ إِبْـراهـيم، وَقِهِ بِرَحْمَـتِكَ عَذابَ الْجَـحِيمِ, وَأَبْـدِلْهُ داراً خَـيْراً مِنْ دارِه ، وَأَهْلاً خَـيْراً مِنْ أَهْلِـه, اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لإِسْلافِنَا, وَأَفْراطِنَا, وَمَنْ سَبَقَنَاَ بِالإِيمَان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma &#8216;a&#8217;ith-hu min &#8216;athaabil-qabri. Allaahum-maj&#8217;alhufaratan wa thukhran liwaalidayhi, wa shafee&#8217;an mujaaban.

<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, protect him from the torment of the grave. O Allah, make him a precursor, a forerunner and a treasure for his parents and an answered intercessor. O Allah, make him weigh heavily in their scales (of good) and magnify their reward. Make him join the righteous of the believers. Place him in the care of Ibrahim. Save him by Your mercy from the torment of Hell. Give him a home better than his home and a family better than his family. O Allah, forgive those who have gone (i.e. passed away) before us, our children lost (by death), and those who have preceded us in Faith.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Extracted with slight modifications from &#8220;Mysteries of the Soul Expounded&#8221; ©1994 Abul-Qasim Publishing House</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of various schools of thought [1] differ greatly regarding the nature and essence of the soul (nafs). Is it a part of the physical body or a non-essential characteristic [2] of it? Is it an entity consigned to dwell within the physical body?, or is it an independent essence in itself? Is the nafs the same as the rûh (spirit)? Finally, what happens to the soul upon death? Is it confined to its body and its grave? If not, is it free to move about in the unseen spiritual world and on the earth? [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this subject, leading theologians of various sects have put forward a host of conflicting opinions. It would be beyond the scope of the present work to examine each and every view put forward by the various scholars; however, a brief mention of some of their opinions regarding this issue is necessary. The correct view [4] is given, supported by sound reason and statements from the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Various Incorrect Theories</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the theologian, Abul-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;arî scholars differed regarding the rûh (spirit), nafs (soul) and hayâh (life force). An-Nadhdhâm, one of the leaders of the Mu&#8217;tazilah, [5] is attributed with having said that the nafs is the form of the rûh. He further claimed that the rûh is alive (i.e. animate) and e ists independently. In contrast to his view, other scholars alleged that the rûh is a non-essential characteristic of the human being, unable to exist independently of itself. Still others opposed both of these views and claimed that it is not known what rûh is &#8211; an essential characteristic or a non-essential characteristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proponents of another theory claimed that man consists of a particular form contained within a physical body, however, they differed as to precisely what this form is. One group maintained that the form consists of four ingredients [6] from which the physical body originates and further develops. A second opinion was that it represents pure blood, free of impurities and contamination. Another view claimed that this form is the animate life in man, the sensual heat which pervades the body. And a fourth group proposed that the form is an essential element which causes all animate, living beings to function in a particular manner [7] yet is not separated from such beings and does not have a different structure. Although there are other opinions[8] defining this form within the physical body, the four previously mentioned views are a sufficient sample.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Correct View</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is considered as the most accurate view regarding the nafs and the rûh is that of Ibn al-Qayyim [9] which is affirmed by Ibn Abul-&#8216;Izz al-Hanafî in his commentary on al-&#8216;Aqeedat at-Tahâwiyyah. [10] They base their position on various verses of the Qur&#8217;ân and the traditions of the Prophet (S) as well as on sound logic and rational thought. According to them, man consists of a spirit and a body together. The spirit is an entity which differs from the physical, tangible body. It is a higher type of luminous (or light-like) being, alive and moving, and it penetrates the limbs, circulating through them as water circulates throughout the petals of a rose, as oil circulates throughout the olive and as fire circulates throughout the burning embers of coal. One may reasonably perceive the soul filling and occupying the body; its form, though non-physical, is molded into the body&#8217;s shape. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul will maintain its penetration of the limbs of the physical body and continue to affect their sense, movement and will as long as these limbs remain sound. However, if they are overcome [12] and no longer accept the forces enacted upon them by the soul, the soul leaves the body and enters the spiritual world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Qur&#8217;ânic Evidence</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain circumstances of the human soul are mentioned in various places of the Qur&#8217;ân.[13] Two such examples follow:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh takes soul at the time of their death and [the souls] of those that do not die during their sleep. He retains those souls for which He has ordained death, whereas He releases the rest for an appointed term.&#8221; </b> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse it is stated that there are only two points in time at which Allâh takes souls: at death and during sleep. [15] When one sleeps, Allâh separates the soul from the body. If He has decreed death for a person at this point, the separation becomes permanent and the body no longer functions. In the case of one for whom death has not been decreed at that time, the soul taken during sleep is returned to its respective body upon awakening. However, the soul for which Allâh has decreed death need not necessarily be taken during sleep but may be taken at a time other than sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;If you could see when the wrongdoers taste the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out, [saying], &#8216;Deliver up your souls. This day you will be awarded a degrading punishment.&#8217; &#8221; </b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is stated that death is painful for the disbelievers. Although they are ordered to surrender their souls to the angels, they are unwilling; therefore, the soul must be forced out as it does not wish to meet its punishment. [17] The terms &#8220;akhrijû anfusakum&#8221; used in this Qur&#8217;ânic verse literally means &#8220;expel or push out your souls,&#8221; indicating that the soul becomes a separate entity from the physical body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Evidence from the Sunnah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sunnah is replete with descriptions of the state and nature of the human soul. These hadîths substantiate the view held by the dependable scholars of ahl as-sunnah. An example of the physical and psychological punishment awaiting the disbelievers occurs in the following portion of a long, authentically related hadîth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Angel of Death.[says], &#8216;O you foul soul, come out to the anger and wrath of your Lord.&#8217; The soul inside the disbeliever&#8217;s body is overcome by terrible fear [and does not want to deliver itself up], whereupon the Angel of Death violently pulls it out like multi-pronged skewers being yanked out of wet wool &#8211; tearing with them the arteries and nerves.&#8221; </i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated in an authentic tradition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah reported: <i>&#8220;Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (S) entered upon Abû Salamah [i.e. his corpse], whose eyes were wide open. The Prophet (S) closed the lids and then said, &#8216;When the rûh [spirit] is taken out, the eyesight follows it [i.e., watches it ascend].&#8217; &#8220;</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These hadîths indicate in two ways that the soul is indeed a form. First of all, something must have a form in order to be grasped and extracted. And second of all, eyes can only visualize something that has a form. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet (S) described how the believer&#8217;s soul comes out of the body:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Angel of Death comes to the [dying] believer, sits at his head and says, &#8216;O you good soul, come out and receive your Lord&#8217;s forgiveness and pleasure.&#8217; Then the soul flows out effortlessly just as water flows from the mouth of a waterskin.&#8221; </i> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the same hadîth that as the soul is being carried up through the skies, the angels ask, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; This question reaffirms the soul&#8217;s separate existence from the body. The angels would not pose such a question unless they had seen a distinct form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the following hadîth also affirms that the soul separates from the body:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (S) said: <i>&#8220;When the soul of the believer comes out [of its body], two angels receive it and rise with it towards the heavens, whereupon the inhabitants of the heavens say, &#8216;A good soul has come from the earth. Allâh has blessed you and the body which you used to occupy.&#8217; &#8220;</i> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic expression &#8220;kunti ta&#8217;mureenah&#8221; (&#8220;you used to occupy&#8221;) suggests that the soul inhabited the body, filling and possessing the whole of it. The soul&#8217;s dwelling within the body and departure from it clearly confirms the soul&#8217;s own entity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Not the four famous schools of fiqh (jurisprudence) but rather leading scholars and thinkers who represent various unorthodox sects, such as the Mu&#8217;tazilites, Rafidhites and philosophers. They have expressed various incorrect views and opinions on this and other subjects of &#8216;aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] In Arabic, &#8216;aradh. According to the terminology of the philosophers, it refers to things which cannot exist independently, like color, smell, length, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] See Kitâb ar-Rûh, p. 272.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] It is &#8220;correct&#8221; in the sense that it is not contrary to the beliefs of ahl as-sunnah, literally, &#8220;the people of the established way or path&#8221; (those who sincerely and firmly adhere to the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic sunnah as their complete way of life). Indeed, there is little authentic information about the rûh. Referring to the rûh Allâh says in the Qur&#8217;ân: <b>&#8220;And you have not been given knowledge except for a little.&#8221;</b> Sûrah al-Isrâ&#8217;, 17:85. (ed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] A misguided sect which introduced speculative dogmatics into Islâm. The school of thought is characterized by a slanted, so-called &#8220;rationalistic&#8221; approach to matters of faith. They interpret clear texts of the sharî&#8217;ah &#8211; those from the Qur&#8217;ân and the sunnah &#8211; in such a manner as to coincide with their preconceived notions based on what they termed &#8220;sense.&#8221; Ibn al-Qayyim has aptly refuted their views and those of other who have been influenced by philosophical thought foreign to Islâm. Whoever wishes to delve deeply into this aspect is referred to his celebrated treatise, Kitâb ar-Rûh, pp. 266-293, where he meticulously details his refutation with logic and reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] There is a philosophical view which claims that the human body originates from earth, air, fire and water. However, as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân and authentic sunnah, man originates from clay (i.e., earth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] See al-Ghazâlî&#8217;s treatise on the soul, Ma&#8217;ârij al-Qudsfee Madârij Ma&#8217;ârifat an-Nafs, pp. 27-35.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Mentioned and refuted by Ibn Taymiyyah in Majmû&#8217; al-Fatâwâ, vol. 3, pp. 30-35 and vol. 9, pp. 279-302.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] See his famous treatise dealing with the circumstances of the souls of the living and the dead, Kitâb ar-Rûh, pp. 249-250.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] See pp. 443-444.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Descriptions of the spirit as &#8220;light,&#8221; its mode of penetration of the body, as well as its shape cannot be proven by the Qur&#8217;ân or the sunnah. As such, these descriptions can only be considered conclusions based upon their own understanding of the &#8220;proofs.&#8221; (ed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Physical accidents, diseases or disorders may destroy the sound, physical harmony and delicate balance of the body&#8217;s functions, causing a person to die (the point at which the soul leaves the body). In any case, there need not always be a physical dysfunction for divine forces to cause death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Ibn al-Qayyim identifies over ninety supporting statements from the Qur&#8217;ân, the sunnah and sayings of the companions, which altogether give a complete picture of the nature of the human soul and the conditions which surround it. See Kitâb ar-Rûh, pp. 249-261 for details.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Sûrah az-Zumar, 39:42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] The separation which occurs during sleep is temporary, whereas, upon death, it is permanent. For details, see ar-Râzî&#8217;s at-Tafseer al-Kabeer, vol. 26, p. 284.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br>
Sharh Lumu&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad [pg. 105-110]<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. The Emergence of the Dajjaal</b> &#8211; Linguistically, Dajjaal is derived from the word dajl, which means lying and impostering. Religiously, it refers to a man who is an imposter and who will appear during the Last Days, claiming lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His emergence is established in the Sunnah as well as the Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus). The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;O Allaah, verily I seek refuge in you from the punishment of the Hellfire, and I seek refuge in you from the punishment of the grave, and I seek refuge in you from the trial of Maseeh Ad-Dajjaal. And I seek refuge in you from the trial of life and death.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would seek refuge from him during prayer&#8221; [2] and the Muslims have agreed upon his emergence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His story:</b> He will emerge from a road in an area between Shaam and &#8216;Iraaq and will begin to call the people to worship him. A majority of the people that will follow him will be from the Jews, women and bedouins. Seventy-thousand Jews from Asfahaan (in present-day Iran) will follow him and he will travel throughout the entire earth, just as the wind blows rain in all directions, except for Makkah and Madeenah, for he will be prevented from entering them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The length of his stay will be forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be as normal. He is one-eyed (i.e. one eye is good and the other is defective) and between his two eyes will be written KA FA RA (i.e. kaafir or disbeliever). Only the believers will be able to read it. He will bring about great trials, some of which are that he will command the heavens and it will rain and he will command the earth and it will produce vegetation. He will have with him a Garden and a Fire. However, his garden will be a fire, and his fire will be a garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) warned of him by saying: <b>&#8220;Whosoever hears of him, then let him distance himself from him. And whosoever has him reach him, then let him recite the opening verses of Surah Kahf upon him&#8221; &#8211; or &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;let him recite the opening verses of Surah Kahf.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. The Descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam</b> &#8211; The descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam is established in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And there is none of the People of the Scripture, except that he must believe in him (&#8216;Eesaa) before his death.&#8221;</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the death of &#8216;Eesaa which will occur after his descent, as has been interpreted by Abu Hurairah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;I swear by Allaah, &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam will indeed descend judging (mankind) with justice.&#8221;</b> This hadeeth is agreed upon. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims have unanimously agreed upon his descent. He will descend by the white minaret in the east of Damascus, placing his hands upon the wings of two angels. Then it will not be possible for a disbeliever to perceive the scent of his breath, except that he will die. And his breath will extend as far his eyesight extends. He will search for the Dajjaal until he reaches him by the gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. He will break the cross and abolish the jizyah (taxation collected from subjected disbelievers). And the prostration (of worship) will be only one &#8211; for Allaah the Lord of the universe. He will also perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah. All of this is confirmed in Saheeh Muslim and some of it in both Saheehs. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Abu Dawood reported that <b>&#8220;&#8216;Eesaa will remain for forty years after killing the Dajjaal. Then he will die and the Muslims will pray the funeral prayer (Janaazah) over him.&#8221;</b> [7] Al-Bukhaaree mentioned in his At-Tareekh that he will be buried next to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and Allaah knows best. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. The Emergence of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</b> &#8211; These are two non-Arab names or (perhaps) they are Arab names derived from Ma&#8217;j which means riotous disruption or from Ajeej which means the setting ablaze and kindling of a fire. They are two nations from the tribe of Aadam that are currently in existence, based upon the evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says concerning the story of Dhul-Qarnain: <b>&#8220;Until when he reached between two mountains, he found before both of them, a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: &#8216;O Dhul-Qarnain! Verily, Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between them and us?'&#8221;</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;On the Day of Judgement Allaah will say: &#8216;O Aadam, rise and extract the people of the Fire from your offspring.&#8217; Aadam will say: &#8216;Who are the people of the Hellfire?&#8217; Allaah will say &#8216;Out of every thousand, (take out) nine hundred and ninety-nine (persons). At that time, children will become hoary-headed and every pregnant female will drop her load (i.e. miscarriage). And you will see the people as if they were drunk, yet they will not be drunk. But Allaah&#8217;s punishment will be severe.&#8221; News of that distressed the companions severely, so they said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, who amongst us will be that (one) man (out of a thousand)?&#8221; He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Give the good tidings, for indeed from among you will be one and from Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj will be a thousand.&#8221;</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their emergence, which is one of the signs of the Hour, has not occurred before in the past. However, its first indications were present during the time of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). It is confirmed in the two Saheeh collections that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;&#8216;Today a hole has been opened in the barrier of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, like this&#8217;, and he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) made a circle with his index finger and thumb.&#8221;</b> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, their emergence is established in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Until when Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj are let loose (from their barrier), and they swoop down from every mound. And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near.&#8221;</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Verily the Hour will never be established until you see ten signs before it.&#8221; Then he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) mentioned: &#8220;The smoke, the Dajjaal, the Beast, the rising of the sun from the west, the descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam, Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, three tremors (in which the earth will open and swallow those upon it) &#8211; one in the east, one in the west and one in the Arabian peninsula. And the last of them will be a fire that will come out from Yemen, which will drive the people to the (final) place of assembly.&#8221;</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their story is found in the hadeeth of An-Nuwaas Ibn Sam&#8217;aan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said concerning &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam, after the Dajjaal is killed: <b>&#8220;It will be that way, when Allaah will reveal to &#8216;Eesaa: &#8216;I have brought forth certain servants of Mine, against whom none will be able to fight. So lead my servants safely to the Mount (Toor).&#8217; And then Allaah will send Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj and they will come swarming down from every slope. The first portion of them will pass by the lake of Tiberias and drink from what is in it. Then the last portion of them will pass by it and say: &#8216;There was once water here.&#8217; They will continue traveling until they will stop at the mountain of Al-Khamar, which is the mount of Al-Bait-ul-Maqdis. Then they will say: &#8216;We have killed those on earth, come, let us now kill those in the heavens.&#8217; So they will begin to throw their arrows toward the sky and Allaah will return their arrows back to them, smeared with blood. Then the Prophet of Allaah (&#8216;Eesaa) and his companions will be laid siege (so severely), to the extent that the head of an ox would be better to one of them than one hundred deenars is to one of you today. So the Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will supplicate to Allaah, and Allaah will send down upon them, insects which will set upon their (i.e. Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj) necks (biting at it). In the morning, they will perish, like one single person. The Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will then descend (from the Mount) to the ground and they will not find a place the size of a hand span, except that it would be filled with their putrefaction and stench. So the Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will beseech Allaah and He will send birds, whose necks look like that of bactrian camels, which will throw them (corpses of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj) wherever Allaah wills.&#8221;</b> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. The Emergence of the Beast</b> &#8211; Linguistically, the word Ad-Daabbah refers to every creature that moves about the earth. What it means here, is the Beast that Allaah will bring forth, close to the establishment of the Hour. Its emergence is confirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when the word of torment is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth, a Beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat.&#8221;</b> [Surat-un-Naml (27): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Verily the Hour will never be established until you see ten signs before it.&#8221;</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) mentioned from among them: <b>&#8220;The Beast.&#8221;</b> [2Saheeh Muslim and its checking has been stated previously]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan or the authentic Sunnah that indicates the place from where this Beast will emerge or its description. These two have only been mentioned in ahaadeeth, of which there is speculation concerning their authenticity. What is apparent from the Qur&#8217;aan, however, is that it is a Beast that will warn mankind of the nearness of punishment and destruction, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. The Rising of the Sun from the West</b> &#8211; The rising of the sun from the west is established in the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Day that some of the signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do for a person to believe then, if he believed not before nor earned good (by doing good deeds), through his Faith.&#8221;</b> [Surat-ul-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this (some of the signs) is the rising of the sun from the west, for the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Hour will not be established until the sun rises from the west. And when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, and that will be when: &#8216;No good will it do for a person to believe then, if he believed not before nor earned good (by doing good deeds), through his Faith.&#8217;</b>[Surat-ul-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 158]&#8221; [15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Call to Prayer (no. 832) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Masjids and Places of Prayer (no. 589) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhaa</i>)). Also in this section is the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) found in Saheeh Muslim (no. 588).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Refer to the hadeeth of An-Nuwaas Ibn Sam&#8217;aan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) in Saheeh Muslim: Book of Tribulations (no. 2937).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Surat-un-Nisaa (4): 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Business Transactions (no. 2222) and in the Book of Prophets (no. 3448). It is also found in Saheeh Muslim: Book of Faith (no. 155).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Refer to the hadeeth of An-Nuwaas Ibn Sam’aan t in Saheeh Muslim (no. 2937). As for his saying: <b>&#8220;He will break the cross and abolish the jizyah (taxation collected from subjected disbelievers). And the prostration (of worship) will be only one &#8211; for Allaah the Lord of the universe&#8221;</b> then it is found in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah t in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3448) and Saheeh Muslim (no. 155). And there occurs in both Saheehs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;until the single prostration becomes better than the world and what is in it.&#8221;</b> However, the wording that the Shaikh (Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen) mentioned has been attributed by Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in Al-Fath (6/492) to Ibn Mardaweeh. As for his saying: &#8220;He will perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah&#8221;, then it is found in Saheeh Muslim: Book of Hajj (no. 1252) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;By He whose Hand my soul is in, (‘Eesaa) Ibn Maryam) will surely invoke Allaah’s name (i.e. Tahleel) in the valley of Rauhaa, making Hajj or ‘Umrah or a combination of the two.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] <b>Hadeeth Saheeh:</b> An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (9259), Abu Dawood (4324), Ibn Hibbaan (8/277) and Al-Haakim (2/595) who authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. It is also reported by Ibn Abee Shaibah (15/158) and Ibn Jareer (9/388) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah t. Ahmad Shaakir (ra) graded its chain saheeh in his notes to Al-Musnad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in At-Taareekh-ul-Kabeer (1/263), At-Tirmidhee (3617) and Al-Aajuree in Ash-Sharee’ah (pg. 381) from the path of: ‘Uthmaan Ibn Ad-Dahhaak on Muhammad Ibn Yoosuf Ibn ‘Abdillaah Ibn Salaam on his father on the authority of his granfather who said that: &#8220;It is written in the Torah, the description of Muhammad and the description of ‘Eesaa Ibn Maryam. And he will be buried with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;This is not authentic in my opinion and should not be followed.&#8221; At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;This is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.&#8221; Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in Al-Fath (7/66): &#8220;And it is reported on her &#8211; meaning ‘Aa’ishah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhaa</i>) &#8211; in a hadeeth that is not established, that she asked permission of the Prophet r, that if she were to outlive him, that she be buried alongside him. So he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘And how can you do that when there is nothing in that place except for my grave and the graves of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Eesaa Ibn Maryam.’</b> And in the reports of Madeenah (Akhbaar-ul-Madeenah) from a weak source, it is reported that Sa’eed Ibn Al-Musayyib (ra) said: <b>‘Verily, the three graves are in a section of ‘Aa’ishah’s house.

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabi ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PAST HISTORY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those early sects which denied <i>eemaan</i> (firm faith) in the Punishment of the Grave were the <i>Khawaarij</i> and a group from the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>. [1] The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> said, “Our scholars deny the Punishment of the Grave and its rewards.” [2] This is because they innovated a rule that only <i>mutawaatir</i> [3] <i>ahaadeeth</i> amount to knowledge, whereas the authentic <i>aahaad</i> [4] <i>ahaadeeth</i> do not.  And this statement of theirs, that the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i> do not amount to knowledge means that such <i>ahaadeeth</i> – in their false opinion – are not free from the possibility of falsehood, nor error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this innovated principle, they denied those <i>ahaadeeth</i> affirming that the Punishment of the Grave in indeed a true fact, and that it will definitely occur for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from this <i>Ummah</i> – may Allaah protect us from it – since these <i>ahaadeeth</i> were to them of the <i>aahaad</i> category.  So this false principle caused them to deny <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave – not holding it as part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) which is in total opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Righteous Predecessors) and the <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> who followed them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESENT-DAY TRAGEDY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last few years, some of the innocent <i>du’aat</i> (callers to Islaam) have stumbled across the same innovated principle – that the authentic <i>aahaad hadeeth</i> does not amount to knowledge, and therefore cannot be taken as proof for matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> – causing a great number of them to doubt and to reject that the Punishment of the Grave is indeed a true fact; and that it was part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> held fast to by our <i>Salaf</i>.  The result is that discord – and it’s vile fruit – has raised it’s head again amongst some of the precious youth of this <i>Ummah</i>, encircling them just as a ring encircles the finger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abul-Madhaffar as-Sam’aanee [5] – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If a narration is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) – and related by reliable narrators and scholars – and they report it in connected form – their latter people from their predecessors – back to the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), and it is accepted by the scholars, then it necessitates knowledge, where it leads to knowledge.  This is the statement of the great majority of the People of <i>Hadeeth</i>, and those who are precise, and those who work to preserve the <i>Sunnah</i>.  But this saying of theirs, that the <i>aahaad</i> narration does not amount to knowledge, and that it must be narrated in <i>mutawaatir</i> form in order to result in knowledge, then this is something innovated by the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.  Their intention behind it was to reject the narrations.  It (the principle) was seized from them, without understanding, by some scholars of <i>Fiqh</i>, those who did not have a firm footing in knowledge, nor realize what the intent of this saying was.”[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE DESIRED HOPE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this article will attempt to clarify – by the permission of Allaah – that having <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is an obligation upon all Muslims, and that it was indeed part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, previously being denied only by a group of innovators.  It is hoped that those who have erred from the way of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> – the way of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> – would re-assess their stance in light of the evidences presented, hoping that they will return to the truth.  “For indeed the truth is cherished by the Believer, and in returning to it is nobility.  Whereas remaining upon falsehood and defect is despicable.” [7]  Remembering that, “the select and correct way is that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> were upon – that being the truth.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>EVIDENCES FROM THE PURE SUNNAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We shall – for the sake of brevity – consider the evidences from the pure <i>Sunnah</i>, and then look at the sayings of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, and the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah </i>who followed them – omitting the evidences from the <i>Qur‘aan</i> and it’s explanation from the Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] From ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to her and mentioned the Punishment of the Grave, saying to her: May Allaah protect you from the Punishment of the Grave.  So she asked the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) about it and he said, “Yes, there is Punishment in the Grave!”  ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) said: After that, I never saw the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), except that he sought refuge from the Punishment of the Grave in every Prayer that he prayed. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] From Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) once passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, not for something great.”  Then he said, “Rather one of them used to spread gossip and carry tales, whilst the other never protected himself from being soiled by his own urine.”  Ibn ’Abbaas said: He then took a green leaf and spread it into two pieces and places each piece upon each grave, and then he said, “May their punishment become lightened until these two pieces dry.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] From Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the dead are punished in their graves, and the animals hear them.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Haanee, the freed slave of ’Uthmaan, related:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever ’Uthmaan (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) stood at a grave he would weep until his beard became soaked in tears.  It was said to him: Paradise and Hell are mentioned to you, and you do not weep, but you weep over this.  So he said: Indeed the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the grave is the first stopping place for the Hereafter.  So if he is saved therein, then what comes after that is easier than that.  If he is not saved therefrom, then that which comes after is harder.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] From Aboo Hurayrah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When one of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i> (testimony of faith), he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: From the Punishment of Hell, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i> (Anti-Christ).” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] From Umm Khaalid Bint Khaalid (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Seek the Refuge of Allaah from the Punishment of the Grave, since the Punishment of the Grave is <i>haqq</i> (a true fact).” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE STATEMENTS OF THE SALAF OF THIS UMMAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now consider – O honourable reader – the statements of the <i>Salaf</i> of this <i>Ummah</i> with respect to having <i>’aqeedah </i>(firm belief) in the Punishment of the Grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>1</b>] Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah (d.197H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>Sunnah</i> is ten.  Whosoever accepts them has completed the <i>Sunnah</i>, and whosoever abandons anything from them has abandoned the <i>Sunnah</i>: Affirming <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination), giving precedence to Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, the Pond in Paradise, <i>Shafaa’ah</i> (Intercession), the Scales, the Bridge over Hellfire, <i>eemaan</i> is statement and action, the <i>Qur‘aan</i> is the speech of Allaah, Punishment in the Grave, being raised-up on the Day of Judgement and not testifying that any Muslim will definitely be in Paradise or Hell.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>2</b>] Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination); both good and evil consequences are from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic.  Indeed the Punishment of the Grave is a true fact, the Resurrection is a true fact, the Accountability is a true fact, Paradise and Hellfire are true facts.  Whatever else is related in the <i>Sunnah</i> and so mentioned by the scholars, and their followers throughout the lands of the Muslims is also true.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>3</b>] Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – <i>rahimahullaah – </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the essential <i>Sunnah</i>, which if a person leaves any one of its points – not accepting it and not having <i>eemaan</i> in it – then he will not be from amongst its people are: (he then mentions) <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.” [17] He also said, “Punishment in the Grave is a true fact.  The servant will be questioned about his Religion and his Lord.  Munkar and Nakeer and Paradise and Hellfire are also true facts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>4</b>] Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Chapter: Questioning in the Grave and the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>5</b>] Ibn Qutaybah (d.278H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>15</b>] Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE MEANING OF EEMAAN:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.852H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<i>Eemaan</i> in the language means: <i>tasdeeq</i>: (attesting to the truth).  In the <i>Sharee’ah</i>, it means: <i>tasdeeq</i> of what the Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) brought from his Lord &#8211; and this much is agreed upon.  Then there is difference.  Is anything else a condition on top of that, such as stating this <i>eemaan</i> upon the tongue, as well as it being in the heart, or action upon what is attested to by what is ordered and leaving what is forbidden.’’  Up until where al-Haafidh said, ‘‘So the <i>Salaf</i> say, <i>eemaan </i>is <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart, statement of the tongue, and action of the limbs.  They mean by this, that actions are a condition for its completeness.  So from this comes their saying that it increases and decreases, as will follow.  The <i>Murji’ah</i> say, it is <i>’aqeedah</i> and a statement upon the tongue only.  The <i>Karraamiyyah</i> say, it is the statement of the tongue only.  And the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> say, it is action, statement and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  But the difference between the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> and the <i>Salaf</i> is that the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> make actions a condition for the correctness of <i>eemaan</i>, whereas the <i>Salaf</i> make it a condition for its completeness.  As for the second point, then the <i>Salaf</i> hold that it increases and decreases, whereas most of the people of <i>kalaam</i> (theological rhetoric) reject this by saying that if it is liable to decrease, then it is doubt.’’ [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the <i>Salaf</i> agreed that <i>eemaan</i> is <i>’aqeedah</i>, statement, and action.  So, whosoever denies <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, has likewise denied <i>eemaan</i> in it.  Since <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart is the foundation of <i>eemaan</i> &#8211; about which there is agreement from the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.535H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>, and those who came after them from the scholars of the <i>Sunnah</i> are agreed that actions are a part of <i>eemaan</i>…and they say: Indeed <i>eemaan</i> is a statement, action and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  It increases with obedience, and decreases with disobedience.’’ [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having understood this, the falsehood of those who claim to have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, will become very clear.  Since our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> held that the root of <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in it &#8211; so if there is no <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, then there is &#8211; by default &#8211; no <i>eemaan</i> in it as well!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE GRAVE MISTAKE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear, that the <i>Salaf</i> and those who followed them were agreed that the Punishment in the Grave will definitely occur (for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from amongst the Muslims) and that it is obligatory to have <i>eemaan</i> in it, and to consider it as part of the Islaamic <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; and no one whose saying is taken account of opposes them in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the founder of the modernist party <i>Hizbut-Tahreer</i>, like the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> before, also denied <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, explaining his position by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed from them (the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i>) are those which require an action, so it is acted upon.  So from Aboo Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: ‘‘When any of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i>, he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: from the Punishment of the Hellfire, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Dajjaal</i>.’’  And from ’Aa‘ishah: from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), that he used to make supplication in the Prayer saying: ‘‘O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from the Punishment of the Grave, I seek refuge in You from the trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i>, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death.  O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from debt and sin.’’  So these two <i>ahaadeeth</i> are <i>aahaad</i> narrations, and they contain the requirement of an action, i.e. to carry out this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>.  So it is recommended to make this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>, and it is permissible to make <i>tasdeeq</i> (attest) of what is contained in them.  However, what is <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) is to hold it with certainty &#8211; meaning: to have it as part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; as long as it has only been reported in the <i>aahaad</i> <i>hadeeth</i>, a <i>dhannee</i> (non-<i>mutawaatir</i>) proof.  However, if it occurs in <i>mutawaatir</i> form, then it is obligatory to make it part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i>.’’ [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying contains a number of short-comings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] Differentiating between the <i>aahaad</i> and <i>mutawaatir</i> <i>ahaadeeth</i> in matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> is an innovation of the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> &#8211; as has already been explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] Making <i>tasdeeq</i> of the Punishment of the Grave, whilst prohibiting a person to have <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) in it, is a contradiction in terms.  Since &#8211; as has preceeded from the words of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar &#8211; <i>tasdeeq</i> is attesting to the truth of something in the heart, which is the same as <i>’aqeedah</i> and which thereby necessitates <i>eemaan</i>.  However, differentiating between <i>tasdeeq</i> and <i>’aqeedah</i> is innovated speech, opposing the way of our <i>Salaf</i>.  Unfortunately, the likes of this innovation has clearly been stated by the present leader of <i>Hizbut-Tahrir</i> in Britain, when he said: ‘‘We trust it; and I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’adhaabil qabr</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the Punishment of the Grave).  I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’awdatil-Mahdee</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the return of the <i>Mahdee</i>).  I encourage you for that, but whoever believes in that, then he is sinful.’’ [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] How is it possible to affirm the Punishment of the Grave upon the tongue, whilst prohibiting <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) of it in the heart &#8211; is this not but <i>nifaaq</i> (hypocrisy)?!  Rather, <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave necessitates &#8211; as a foundation &#8211; <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart!!  May Allaah have mercy upon Imaam Ahmad, who said: ‘‘You should beware of speaking about an issue in which you are not preceded by a scholar.’’ [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Along with all this, it must be remembered that: ‘‘It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an <i>aayah</i>, or about a <i>Sunnah</i>, which was not there in the time of the <i>Salaf</i>; nor did they have any knowledge about it; nor explain it to the <i>Ummah</i>.  Since this would imply that the <i>Salaf</i> were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!’’ [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Hold fast to the narrations of the <i>Salaf</i>, even if the people were to abandon you.  Beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.’’ [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Stick to the <i>athar</i> (narration) and the way of the <i>Salaf</i> and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.’’ [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, declaring this to be something sinful and prohibited, declaring also that it is not a matter which will definitely occur, but it is a matter which may possibly occur &#8211; is speech in opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; the like of which was previously uttered by only the <i>Khawaarij</i>, and a group from amongst the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>; and there is no doubt in its being a deviation from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, outwardly affirming <i>tasdeeq</i> and apparently affirming <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, is only a contradiction in terms &#8211; since <i>tasdeeq</i>, <i>eemaan</i>, and <i>’aqeedah</i> in the opinion of the <i>Salaf</i>, all imply certainty and being definite &#8211; even if the modernists dislike this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Punishment of the Grave is a true fact; and no one denies it except one who is misguided and misguiding others.’’ [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Naasiree (d.652H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>an-Noorul-Laami’</i> (no. 110):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘We have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its bliss…this is the <i>madhhab</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.  So it is obligatory to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in this.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i> (5/85):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This chapter shows the virtue of seeking refuge &#8211; between the <i>tashahhud</i> and <i>tasleem</i> &#8211; from these (four) matters; and in it is an affirmation of the Punishment of the Grave, and it is the position of the people of the truth &#8211; as opposed to the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.671H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘To have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its trials is obligatory, due to what the most truthful (Muhammad &#8211; <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has mentioned.  This is the belief of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.’’ [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>NEED FOR VERIFICATION:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; the speech of everyone you hear from, particularly in your time.  Do not act in haste, nor enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) speak about it, or any of the Scholars.  So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling to it.  Do not go beyond it for anything, and do not give precedence to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.’’ [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Seereen (d.110) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This knowledge is the Religion, so be careful from whom you take your Religion.’’ [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Shareek (d.177H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Ibaad Ibnul-’Awwaam said: Shareek Ibn ’Abdullaah came to us more than fifty years ago, so we said to him: O Abaa ’Abdullaah!  There are a group of the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who deny the <i>ahaadeeth</i> about Allaah descending to the lowest heaven and that the people shall see their Lord.  So Shareek quoted about ten <i>ahaadeeth</i> like that, and then said: ‘‘As for us, then we have taken our Religion from the sons of the <i>Taabi’een</i>, from the Companions.  From whom did they take theirs?’’ [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is in what has preceded &#8211; if Allaah wills &#8211; a clear explanation for those whose hearts have been enlightened by Allaah with the light of Revelation, and whose has hearts have found peace and delight in the narrations of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>.  Indeed it is this which brings about a firmness of understanding and is a remedy against the darkness of <i>hizbiyyah</i> (party-spirit).  This, in turn, produces the purity and quality, even if numbers are small.  Indeed mere numbers in opposition to the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of the <i>Salaf</i> &#8211; the <i>manhaj</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> &#8211; leads to nothing but deception, destruction and extreme disappointment.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-10 Verses of Al-Momin Surah<br>
</strong><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Jannat ul Firdaus?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who shall inherit Firdaws? (1-10 Verses of Al-Monin Surah)</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Successful indeed are the believers.</li>
<li>Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un (with fear and with tranquillity).</li>
<li>And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.</li>
<li>And those who pay the Zakah.</li>
<li>And those who guard their private parts.</li>
<li>Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame.</li>
<li>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.</li>
<li>Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un.</li>
<li>And those who strictly guard their Salawat.</li>
<li>These are indeed the heirs.</li>
<li>Who shall inherit <strong>Firdaws</strong>. They shall dwell therein forever.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Successful indeed are the believers) means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***These are the believers who have the following characteristics ***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;(Khashi`un) means those with<strong> fear and with tranquillity</strong>.&#8221; This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the <strong>Khushu` of the heart.</strong> This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &#8220;Their Khushu` was in their hearts.&#8221; So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasai from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says: (<em><strong>And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity</strong></em>)[25:72].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: &#8220;By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who pay the Zakah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah: (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) [91:9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one&#8217;s wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: (they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl, (then those are the transgressors.) meaning , aggressors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said: (The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah&#8217; He said, (Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Kindness to one&#8217;s parents. ) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Jihad in the way of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: &#8220;At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said: (Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu&#8217; except the believer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:(These are indeed the heirs.) &#8220;The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said: (Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said: (When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, &#8220;This is your ransom from the Fire.&#8221;) `</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah&#8217;s saying: (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) [19:63] (This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) [43:72]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to give reward to the dead and whether that reaches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views:<br>
1 – That any righteous deed may be given to the dead and that (the reward) reaches them – such as reading Qur&#8217;aan, fasting, praying and other acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – That no righteous deed reaches the dead except those for which there is evidence that it reaches them. This is the more correct view. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>
&#8220;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8221; [al-Najm 53:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.&#8221; Narrated by Muslim, 1631, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The paternal uncle of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam – Hamzah (may Allaah be pleased with him) – died,<br>
as did his wife Khadeejah and three of his daughters, but it is not narrated that he read Qur&#8217;aan for any of them, or offered a sacrifice or fasted or prayed on their behalf. No such thing has been narrated from any of the Sahaabah either. If it were prescribed, then they would have done it before us. The exceptions for which there is evidence that the reward does reach the deceased are: Hajj, &#8216;Umrah, obligatory fasts, charity and du&#8217;aa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#8221; &#8216;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this verse al-Shaafa&#8217;i and those who followed him understood that the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan does not reach the deceased, because it is not something that they did or earned. Hence the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not recommend or encourage his ummah to do that, and he did not tell them to do that through any statement or gesture. Nor is it narrated that any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did that. If it were good they would have done that before us. So the acts of worship are restricted to those mentioned in the texts, and there is no room for analogy or personal opinions. With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and charity, there is scholarly consensus that the reward for them reaches the deceased and that they are mentioned in sharee&#8217;ah. Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/258.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we assume that the reward for all righteous deeds reaches the deceased, then the best thing that can benefit the deceased is du&#8217;aa&#8217;. So why should we ignore that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)has encouraged us to do, and turn to other things that he did not do and that none of his companions did? All goodness is to be found in the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about giving the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan and charity to one&#8217;s mother, whether she is alive or dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the scholars differed as to whether the reward for that will reach the deceased. There are two scholarly views, the more correct of which is that it does not reach the deceased because there is no evidence to that effect. The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam did not do that for his deceased Muslim loved ones such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, and the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that or approve of it, as far as we know. It is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Qur&#8217;aan for the dead or the living, or to pray on their behalf, or to observe voluntary fasts on their behalf, because there is no evidence for any of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that we do not do anything except that which is proven to be prescribed by Allaah or His Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Charity benefits both the living and the dead, according to Muslim consensus. Similarly du&#8217;aa&#8217; benefits both the living and the dead according to Muslim consensus. Undoubtedly the living benefit from charity given by them and by others, and they benefit from du&#8217;aa&#8217;. If a person makes du&#8217;aa&#8217; for his parents when they are alive, they benefit from his du&#8217;aa&#8217;, as they also benefit from charity given on their behalf when they are still alive, and from Hajj done on their behalf if they are unable to do it themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. So a person may benefit them by doing that. Hence it is narrated that a woman said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah&#8217;s command to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj on his behalf.&#8221; Another man came to him and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj or travel; shall I perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on behalf of your father.&#8221; This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of one who has died or on behalf of a living man or woman who is unable to do it because of old age. So giving charity, making du&#8217;aa&#8217; and performing Hajj on behalf of one who has died or one who is unable to do it will benefit him, according to all the scholars. Similarly one may fast on behalf of a deceased person, if he owed an obligatory fast – whether as the result of a vow, as an expiation or to make up for a Ramadaan fast – because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam; &#8220;Whoever dies owing a fast, his heir must observe the fast on his behalf.&#8221; Saheeh – agreed upon. And there are other ahaadeeth which say the same thing. But whoever delays Ramadaan fasts for a legitimate reason, such as sickness or travel, then dies before he is able to make them up, there is no need to fast them on his behalf or feed the poor, because he is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo&#8217; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 4/348.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for a man to give money in charity and to share the reward for it with someone else?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: It is permissible for a person to give money in charity and intend for it to be on behalf of his father, his mother or his brother or anyone else he wants among the Muslims, because the reward is great. If charity is given sincerely for the sake of Allaah and from wealth that is acquired in a halaal manner, then the reward will be multiplied greatly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allaah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allaah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower&#8221; [al-Baqarah 2:261]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam used to slaughter a single sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household. Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, 18/249</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above it is clear that what you have mentioned about giving the reward of dhikr to your parents is not correct according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, whether they are alive or deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather what we advise you to do is to make a great deal of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for them and give charity on their behalf, for all goodness is in following the guidance of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam and his noble companions. The scholars are agreed that the benefits of du&#8217;aa&#8217;, praying for forgiveness, giving charity and Hajj reach the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and praying for forgiveness, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And those who came after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith'&#8221; [al-Hashr 59:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask that he be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When you offer the (funeral) prayer for the deceased, then make du&#8217;aa&#8217; sincerely for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah that a man said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;My mother died suddenly and she did not leave a will, but I think that if she could have spoken she would have given in charity. Will she have a reward if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 1388; Muslim,<br>
no. 1004.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated by al-Bukhaari from Sa&#8217;d ibn &#8216;Ubaadah that his mother died when he was absent, and he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my mother has died when I was absent. Will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I ask you to bear witness that my garden that bears fruit is given in charity on her behalf.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2756.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Hajj, the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said to one who asked him about Hajj: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that if your mother had a debt, you would pay it off for her?&#8221; She said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;A debt owed to Allaah is more deserving of being paid off.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6699; Muslim, 1148.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above you will know that giving charity on behalf of the deceased will benefit him and its reward will reach him. There is a da&#8217;eef (weak) hadeeth about offering prayer on behalf of the dead. Imam Muslim mentioned in his introduction to his Saheeh that &#8216;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak regarded this hadeeth as weak, then he said: There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead). End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Nawawi said: &#8220;There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead)&#8221; means that this hadeeth is not to be taken as evidence. But whoever wants to honour his parents, let him give charity on their behalf, for (the reward of) charity will reach the deceased and benefit them, and there is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning this point. This is the correct view. With regard to the report narrated by the qaadi Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Maawardi al-Basri al-Faqeeh al-Shaafa&#8217;i in his book al-Haawi from some of the scholars of al-kalaam, that no reward can reach the deceased after his death, this is a view that is definitely wrong and is clearly contrary to the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah, so no attention should be paid to it. With regard to praying and fasting on behalf of the dead, the view of al-Shaafa&#8217;i and the majority of the scholars is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased, unless it is a fast that was obligatory for the deceased, so his heir or someone to whom the heir gives permission makes it up on his behalf. Two views concerning this were narrated from al-Shaafa&#8217;i, the better known of which is that it is not valid; the more correct view according to the later Shaafa&#8217;i scholars is that it is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the well-known view of the Shaafa&#8217;i madhhab is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased. Some of his companions said that its reward does reach the deceased. Some of the scholars were of the view that the reward of all acts of worship – prayer, fasting, reading Qur&#8217;aan, etc – reaches the deceased… Then al-Nawawi mentioned that the reward for du&#8217;aa&#8217;, charity and Hajj reaches the deceased, according to scholarly consensus. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/72): The deceased can benefit from charity given on his behalf, which includes a waqf of a Mus-haf etc, or digging a well, or planting a tree, whether he does that during his lifetime or it is done by someone else on his behalf after his death. With regard to the best ways of benefiting ones deceased loved ones, you should make a lot of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and say: &#8216;My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young'&#8221; [al-Isra&#8217; 17:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, or beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who will pray for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, the best things on which charity may be spent are jihad for the sake of Allaah, building mosques, and helping seekers of knowledge by printing books for them or giving them money that they need. And Allaah knows best.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah News Letter<br>
Safar 1417H / July 1996 , Issue No.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing Paradise, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will enter those who believe and do righteous and correct actions into Paradise, beneath which rivers flow. Wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments will be made of silk.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hajj 24:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the pious and obedient ones will be in Paradise, amongst gardens and water-springs. It will be said to them: Enter! In peace and safety. And We shall remove from their hearts any ill-feeling, so they will be like brothers, facing each other on thrones. No sense of hardship shall touch them, and they will be of those who never leave.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hijr 15:45-46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Paradise</b>, that precious sanctity to which, throughout the ages, the Believers run towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, a burning flame that was in the hearts of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors), a flame that spurred them to aim for the highest examples of velour in <i>jihaad</i> and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, that noble goal which aspiring eyes are fixed towards and which yearning souls long for, in all times and in all places. They find worldly afflictions agreeable to them for the sake of achieving Paradise. Indeed, to enter into it and remain in it is considered the greatest goal for the Believers, and it is a hope which is kept in view throughout life&#8217;s journey. How often has Paradise been the incentive and a motivation for goodness and truth, despite the dangers, afflictions and thorns that lie along the path &#8211; even if it involves certain death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the case in the days of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, as Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> related: Once Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions proceeded towards Badr and arrived there before the disbelievers of Makkah. When the disbelievers arrived Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;None of you should proceed ahead of me in anything.&#8221;</i> The disbelievers then advanced towards us and Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Rise-up to enter Paradise, whose width is equal to the heavens and the earth.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umayr ibn al-Humaam al-Ansaaree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: O Messenger of Allaah ! Is Paradise equal in width to the heavens and the earth? He said: <i>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</i> Umayr then exclaimed words of astonishment and excitement, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked him: <i>&#8220;What made you say these words of astonishment and excitement?&#8221;</i> He replied: O Messenger of Allaah ! Nothing but the desire to be amongst its inhabitants. Allaah&#8217;s Messeneger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> then said, <i>&#8220;Indeed, you are surely from amongst its inhabitants.&#8221;</i> So &#8216;Umayr then took some dates from his bag and began to eat them. Then he said: If I were to live until I have eaten all the dates, then indeed this life would be too long. He threw away the remaining dates which were with him and he fought until he was killed. 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the stance taken in later times:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, whilst in the presence of his enemy, narrated: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Indeed, the gates of Paradise are beneath the shade of swords.&#8221;</i> A man who was in a shabby condition got up and said: Abu Moosaa! did you hear this from the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>? So he said: Yes! He returned to his friend and said: I bid you salaam (a farewell greeting of peace). Then he broke the sheath of his sword, threw it away, then rushed into the thick of the enemy and fought them until he was slain. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;O my soul! It is not, except a few days of patience;<br>
As if the extent were but a few dreams.<br>
O my soul! Pass quickly on through this world;<br>
And leave it, for indeed life lies ahead of it.&#8221;</i> 4</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEFENDING THE RELIGION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> (d.241H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance, patiently bearing ill treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by Iblees (the Devil) have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones &#8211; those who uphold die banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords; who differ about the Book, oppose the Book, and agree upon opposing the Book. They speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant masses with such ambiguities. We seek refuge in Allaah from the trials of the misguided ones.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When some people asked Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;If I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant masses know the truth from falsehood?&#8221;</span> Those who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those who innovate in matters of worship, then it is obligatory that they be exposed and that the Muslims be warned against them &#8211; by unanimous agreement of the Muslims Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked about a person who fasted, preyed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship; if he was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against <i>ahlul-bid&#8217;ah</i> (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that openly opposing the innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the religion of Allaah and defending it from their attacks is a collective obligation &#8211; as is agreed upon by the Scholars. For Allaah did not raise up some people to oppose the innovators, then the religion would suffer harm, corruption and deviation. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater then the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. Since when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts, nor their religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>UNITING THE RANKS UPON THE TRUTH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect, ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not necessitate that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the rope of Allaah necessitates is: to order the good, forbid the evil and also to clarify the truth &#8211; with the clear <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs &#8211; to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; [Sooratul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who shall be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;-lmraan 3:110]. And when the people of truth withhold from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his opposition. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying: &#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221; The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> have prohibited. Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one. Thus, if the difference involves a particular issue of ijtihaad wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a clear text of the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2] And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8220;</b> [Soorah at-Towbah 9:71]. And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.</b>&#8221; [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125]. And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</i> 5 And the <i>aayaat</i> (verses) and <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are plenty.&#8221; 6</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Talbees Iblees: pg. 162-163<br>
Taken from Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a group of people – i.e. from the Sufis – came and began to speak to them concerning hunger, poverty, whisperings and notions. And they authored books on these subjects, as was the case with Al-Haarith Al-Muhaasibee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another group of people came (afterward) that revised the way of Sufism, characterizing it with attributes by which they distinguished it (from its original state), such as: wearing old tattered clothes, hearing (music), bursting out in passionate emotions, dancing and clapping. And they particularized themselves by exceeding in cleanliness and purification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this matter (Sufism) continued to flourish, and their shaikhs began to fabricate stories for them and speak about their mystical occurrences. This affirmed their remoteness from the scholars. Rather, this even affirmed their view that what they were upon was the most complete forms of knowledge, such that they named it the hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>), while making knowledge of the Religion, apparent knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-uhd-dhaahir</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them were those whose severity in hunger brought them to fancy corrupt notions. So they would claim strong love and passion for the truth. It was as if they imagined a figure with a beautiful appearance and thus fell madly in love with it. These individuals linger between disbelief and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then these people divided into various orders and their beliefs grew corrupt. So among them were those who held the view that Allaah is incarnate in His creation (<i>hulool</i>), and those who held the view that the Creator and creation were in reality one existence (<i>Ittihaad</i>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Devil did not stop speaking to them about different types of innovations until they made them into aspects of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>as-Sunan</i>.’ He also compiled a book for them called ‘<i>Haqaa’iq-ut-Tafseer</i>’, in which he mentioned amazing things about them (i.e. Sufis) concerning their interpretation of the Qur’aan, based on the (mystical things) that occurred to them, without tracing that back to any of the sources where knowledge is derived from. And indeed, what brought them to take such things and place them as their views was their state of daze, due to their strict abstinence of food and their love for talking at great lengths of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Qazaaz informed us that: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Muhammad bin Yoosuf Al-Qattaan An-Naisaburee said to me: &#8220;Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee is not reliable. He was not able to hear anything except for a few sounds, due to deafness. So when the ruler Abu ‘Abdillaah bin Al-Bay’ died, he began to narrate hadeeth on the authority of Al-A’asam from Taareekh Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een as well as other books besides it. And he would fabricate <i>ahaadeeth</i> for the Sufis.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr As-Siraaj wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Lum’-us-Soofiyyah</i>’ in which he stated horrendous beliefs and hideous statements that we will mention later in more detail, by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote the book <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob </i>in which he mentioned fabricated ahaadeeth and narrations that cannot be traced back to any source with regard to the subject of prayers during the days and nights and other subjects. He also mentioned false doctrines in it and constantly repeated statements such as: <b>&#8220;Some of the mukaashifeen (those to whom Allaah has disclosed secrets of hidden realities) have stated&#8230;&#8221;</b> These types of words are empty and pointless. He also mentions in it, relating from some Sufis, that Allaah reveals aspects of the hidden matters to his &#8220;saints&#8221; in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor Al-Qazaaz informed us: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Abu Taahir Muhammad bin al-‘Ullaaf said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee entered the city of Basrah after the death of Abul-Husayn bin Saalim and ascribed to his views. The he traveled to Baghdad and the people gathered around him in the place of admonition to hear from him. So he began to speak but got confused and began to mix up his words. It was memorized from him that he said: <b>&#8216;There is nothing more harmful to the creation than the Creator.’</b> So the people declared him an innovator and deserted him completely. Afterward, he was prevented from speaking to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote a book in the language of the Sufis called <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob</i> in which he mentioned many horrendous and repugnant things concerning Allaah’s Attributes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Nu’aim Al-Asbahaanee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Hilyat-ul-Awliyaa</i>’, in which he mentioned many evil and despicable things on the laws of Sufism. And he had no shame in stating that Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee, as well as the rest of the high-ranking Companions, were from among the Sufis! So in this book, he spoke of amazing things that occurred to them. He also mentioned Shuraih Al-Qaadee, Al-Hasan Al-Basree, Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Ahmad bin Hanbal as being from among them (i.e. the Sufis). Similarly, in ‘<i>Tabaqaat-us-Soofiyyah</i>&#8216;, As-Sulamee mentioned Fudail (bin ‘Iyyaad), Ibraaheem bin Adham and Ma’roof Al-Kurkhee as being from among the Sufis, by pointing out that they were individuals who abstained from the worldly life and its luxuries (zuhd).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufism is a way that is well known for exceeding in abstinence of worldly luxuries (<i>zuhd</i>). What shows the difference between them (i.e. scholars above, and the Sufis) is that no one ever condemned abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>), whereas Sufism was condemned because of what we will mention later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd-ul-Kareem bin Hawaazin Al-Qushayree wrote a book for them called ‘<i>ar-Risaalah</i>’, in which he mentioned many far-fetched and mystical things such as talk on <i>al-fanaa </i>(annihilation) and <i>al-baqaa </i>(subsistence), <i>al-qabd </i>(contraction), <i>al-bast </i>(expansion), <i>al-waqt </i>(the moment), <i>al-haal </i>(ecstasy), <i>al-wajd </i>(finding) and <i>al-wujood </i>(existence), <i>al-jam’ </i>(union) and <i>tafaruqqah</i> (separation), <i>as-sahu </i>(clarity) and <i>as-sakr </i>(drunkenness), <i>adh-dhawq </i>(taste) and <i>ash-sharab </i>(drink), <i>al-mahu </i>(effacement) and <i>al-ithbaat </i>(affirmation), <i>at-tajallee </i>(manifestation) and <i>al-muhaadarah </i>(presence), <i>al-mukaashafah</i> (unveiling) and <i>al-lawa’ih</i>, <i>at-tawaali’ </i>and <i>al-lawaami’</i>, <i>at-takween</i> and <i>at-tamkeen</i>, <i>ash-sharee’ah </i>and <i>al-haqeeqah </i>(reality),[1] and other insanities that do not amount to anything. And his tafseer is even more bizarre than this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Muhammad bin Taahir Al-Maqdisee who wrote &#8216;<i>Safwat-ut-Tasawwuf</i>&#8216; for them, in which he stated things that any person with common sense would feel ashamed to mention! We will mention what is proper from its subjects, with the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee who wrote the book &#8216;<i>Ihyaa ‘Uloom-ud-Deen</i>&#8216; for them, according to the methodology of the (Sufi) people, which he filled with baseless ahaadeeth even though he knew well they were baseless. He spoke about knowledge of the <i>Mukaashafah </i>(unveiling of unseen by Allaah to Sufis) and withdrew from the principles of Fiqh. And he stated such things as: ‘Indeed the stars, the sun and the moon, which Ibraaheem saw, were in fact lights that screened Allaah!’ Such things are not mentioned in any of the sources of knowledge. Rather, this is from the types of speech of the Baatiniyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Al-Ghazaalee) also said in the book &#8216;<i>Al-Mufsih bil-Ahwaal</i>&#8216;: &#8220;While in their state of wakefulness, the Sufis are able to witness the angels and souls of the prophets, hear their voices and take hold of benefit from them. Then this condition escalates from the witnessing (of their) images to levels in which they are contained within these domains.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The factors that caused these individuals to write these books was their little knowledge of the Sunnah, Islaam and the narrations, as well as their dedication for what they approved of from the way of the people (Sufis). They only approved this way because of adoration for abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>) that was established in their souls. They did not see any condition better than the condition of these people (Sufis) in regards to appearance, nor any speech more pleasant than their speech, whereas in the biographies of the Salaf, they found a form of harshness. So the people inclined very strongly towards these individuals (Sufis).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to what we stated previously, that it was a way, which was characterized outwardly by cleanliness and worship, whereas on the inside, it was about indulging in leisure and hearing music, which the bodily dispositions incline to. The original Sufis would flee from the leaders and authorities. However (in later times) they became friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of these books that were compiled for them have things in them that cannot be traced back to any (authentic) source. Rather, they are only based on mystical occurrences that befell some of them, which they managed to take hold of and record. They called this hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>). Abu Ya’qoob Ishaaq bin Hayya said: &#8220;I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal once when asked about the occurrence of delusions and notions, so he replied: <b>&#8216;The Sahaabah and the Taabi’een never spoke about such things.&#8217;</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="line-height:1.5em;">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> These are names for Sufi concepts and beliefs. Some of them have been defined as such: Fanaa: (Annihilation) A state in which the mureed (Sufi) becomes so absorbed in dhikr that he becomes unaware of himself and his surroundings and is at tranquility with the remembrance of his Lord, negating or annilihating his self. Bast (Expansion) and Qabd (Contraction) refer to the various degrees of relative union and separation from the Creator. Baqaa: The consciousness of survival in Allaah. Waqt: (Time) The moment in which someone becomes conscious of the reality and the Creator; the mureed is neither in the past or the future. Mukaashafah: (Unveiling) The state in which the Truth (Allaah) and the Unseen become revealed to the Sufi. Tajallee: (manifestation) the state in which Allaah manifests revelation to the Sufi. Sakr: (Drunkenness) A state in which the mureed is absorbed in the hidden matters to the point that the common person cannot understand him. Wajd: (Finding) State of ecstasy in which the Sufi finds the realization and presence of Allaah, usually after hearing (Samaa) dhikr. Jam’: (Union) A state in which the Sufi only sees the Truth (Allaah) without the creation. Muhaadarah: (Presence) Being in the presence of Allaah. Tafarruqah or Farq: (Separation) When the Sufi in the state of Fanaa sees the creation (i.e. himself), the opposite of Jam’. And Allaah knows best.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue #21<br>
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing the Muslim scholars do not differ about at all is the fact that Islaam is established upon two magnificent and great fundamental principles. Indeed they are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) worshipping only Allaah apart from others and<br>
2) following and taking our example from only the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) apart from others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what I want to discuss here only concerns the principle that states: A Muslim’s Eemaan does not become complete until he believes that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah. And that if any person on the face of this earth were to bear witness to Allaah’s Oneness according to the three categories (of Tawheed), then he will not be a believer until he adds to that his belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is His slave and messenger. So if it is this way, then it is required for every Muslim to learn the meaning of this beautiful statement (of Tawheed): <strong> “So know that Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah)” [Surah Muhammad: 19]</strong> and to acknowledge the true sense of its meaning in two parts. First, to believe in it and second, to put it into actuality in himself, his worship and his belief in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” This testimony (of bearing witness that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger) completes the first testimony (of bearing witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So due to this, the testimony (of Faith) does not become complete unless the Muslim believes in this (second) testimony &#8211; understanding, believing and accepting it firstly, and then applying it in the affairs of his life secondly. So our saying: “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger” requires, among other things, that we believe that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) conveyed the message and that he carried out his task in its complete and perfect form, such that no one that comes after him, however high or elevated he may be, can correct or amend some part of it. Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, indicated this fact in his saying: <strong> &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is authentically reported on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) from numerous paths of narration that he said: <strong>“I have not left anything that will bring you closer to Allaah and distance you from the Hellfire, except that I have commanded you with it. And I have not left anything that will bring you closer to the Hellfire and distance you from Allaah except that I have forbade you from it.” </strong>So there has not been left any room for amending anything from it, whether it be a simple or a trivial thing being amended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is reported on the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah (Madeenah), Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, which he deems is good, then he has claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has betrayed (the trust of conveying) the Message. Read the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic: &#8216;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8217; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah:3] So whatever was not (part of) the Religion on that day, is not (part of) the Religion on this day. And the last part of this ummah (nation) will not be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was from the understanding of Imaam Maalik, the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah, such that he plainly stated in a clear Arabic language that whoever introduces into Islaam just one innovation and then claims that it is something good, he has in fact claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) betrayed the Message. And whoever makes this claim, he does not believe (truly) that “Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” As is very clear in the words of this noble Imaam, it (the innovation) is “not (part of) the Religion on this day.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to implement his Ittibaa’ (following of the Prophet), such that he could be truthful in (his declaration that) Muhammad, Allaah’s Messenger, is His slave and messenger. And that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) brought the complete and pure message, without adding to it or subtracting from it. If this is the case, then every Muslim must acknowledge his extent and stop at the points where his Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has placed limits for him, such as the acts of worship and deeds of obedience (to Allaah). This is because the pen has dried with what was revealed previously (i.e. no more revelation after Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). And there was no room left open to approve of an act of worship that didn’t exist previously in the first days (i.e. of the Prophet). Consequently, our pious predecessors (Salaf As-Saalih) have come and gone all acknowledging the extent of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in that he first fulfilled his mission and conveyed the Message, as you know. And (second) that he was the best worshipper amongst Allaah’s worshippers and the most fearing of Allaah. So there is no room to correct him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the standpoint of legislating (revealed matters) into the Religion, as you have heard the ayah and Imaam Maailk’s comments about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Such that it can be claimed that there is someone who is a better worshipper and more worshipping (of Allaah) than Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever understands these two facts, which are related to one’s belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger, he will limit the worship he performs for Allaah to only that which has been reported on the Prophet (in the ahaadeeth). And he will not put any example or role model before him other than the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). Nor will he ever claim this second point, meaning it is impossible that it can get into the mind of any believer that he is more dutiful to Allaah or more fearing of Allaah or more worshipping of Allaah than him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is something impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention what has been reported in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik (raa) that a group of people went to see the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) but asked his wives because they were not able to find him. So they asked his wives about the Prophet’s worship – about his standing in prayer at night, his fasting during the day and about his relations with his wives. So they mentioned to them what they knew about his guidance regarding that &#8211; and his guidance is the best guidance on the face of this earth as is stated in the khutbah al-Haajah: <strong>“And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.”</strong> The wives of the Prophet mentioned to these men that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would fast and break his fast, and that he would pray at night and also sleep and that he would marry women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (raa) said: “When they heard that from the wives of the Prophet, they found his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) worship to be little.&#8221; They thought it to be little because of what had settled in their minds that the Prophet must pray the whole night and that he must fast all the time and that he was a monk and did not go near his wives. So they were shocked to find something that was not in compliance with their notions. So they assumed that the reason for this was because Allaah had forgiven all of the Prophet&#8217;s past and future sins. So it is as if they said: “The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) only minimized in his worship &#8211; which they thought to be little &#8211; because Allaah had forgiven his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there wasn&#8217;t left any obstacle preventing him from increasing in the worship of his Lord.” This was a mistake on their part without a doubt. This is since they didn’t know that this worship which they thought to be little, was in fact worship that could not be fulfilled by even the best worshipper amongst mankind, not even Dawood (as) about whom it is authentically reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong> “Dawood was the best worshipper amongst mankind.” </strong>This group of people did not know that the Prophet was the best worshipper amongst mankind with this worship (of his) and that not even the best worshipper amongst mankind was able to perform his worship, as I have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was from the things that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) was asked about when some people – who were well aware of his habits not like that group of people that was ignorant of his habits – found him, and they felt compassion for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), because they saw him standing in prayer until his feet had become swollen. So they said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins.” They meant by this: “Have pity on yourself, O Messenger of Allaah! Be easy in the worship, for your feet have become swollen.&#8221; And his response was: <strong> &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the false reasoning employed by that small band of people, who said the reason for the Prophet&#8217;s little worship was because Allaah had forgiven his past and future sins. They were not aware that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would stand in night prayer until his feet would become swollen. So when it was said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins”, he responded: &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basing on what they imagined was little worship on the part of the Prophet and what they knew of Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins, each person in this small group assumed that they were obligated to exceed in worship and that they must surpass what they heard about the Prophet&#8217;s worship with regard to his fasting, praying at night and relations with women. So they made the following pledges to themselves: The first person said &#8220;I will pray all night and won&#8217;t sleep.&#8221; The second one said: &#8220;As for me, I will fast all the time and never go a day without fasting.&#8221; And the third person said: &#8220;I will not marry women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why? Because they assumed that marriage was a distraction and turned one away from perfecting one&#8217;s worship to Allaah. But they did not know &#8211; and Allaah knows best but it seem to me that they were new (reverts) to Islaam who did not learn yet of the Commands and Rulings of Islaam &#8211; that marriage was itself worship, as is found in the famous hadeeth, when a group of poor people came to the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The people with much wealth and income have surpassed us &#8211; they pray like we pray, they fast like we fast, and they make Hajj like we make Hajj. And they give money in charity but we don&#8217;t give away anything in charity!&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Shall I not direct you to something, which if you do, you will surpass those in front of you and those behind you will never be able catch up to you (in reward), except for those who do the same as you?&#8221; So the representative of the poor people went back to his companions among the poor folk and related to them the good news that came from the Prophet. So they became very happy at hearing it. However, it was not long before their representative went to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger again to tell him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! What you told us was conveyed to the rich folk and so they have begun to do what we are doing.&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;That is the bounty of Allaah, which He gives to whom He pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the narration of Imaam Muslim found in his Saheeh. In another narration of the hadeeth, it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Verily in every tasbeehah (saying SubhanAllaah) there is charity for you. And in every tahmeedah (saying Al-Hamdulillaah) there is charity. And in every takbeerah (saying Allaahu Akbar) there is charity. And in every tahleelah (saying Bismillaah) there is charity. Commanding good is charity and forbidding evil is charity. And removing a harmful obstacle from the road is charity.&#8221; Then the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) continued to mention many noble characteristics. Then he said at the end of the hadeeth: <strong> &#8220;And in your having relations with your wife, there is charity.&#8221;</strong> They said in amazement: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, will one of us fulfill his desire (with his wife) and get rewarded for that?&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;Don’t you see that if one fulfills it in a forbidden way, that he will have a burden (of sin) for it?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So he said: <strong> &#8220;Then likewise, if he fulfills it in a lawful way he will be rewarded for it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were not aware of the likes of this hadeeth and other hadeeths in which there is found an incitement to get married and especially in producing children and progeny, as is reported in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;Marry the fertile and loving woman, for indeed I will compete with other nations by you, as regards to who has the most followers, on the Day of Judgement.&#8221; So the one who marries and keeps himself chaste and keeps his wife chaste, he will be rewarded for that. This group was ignorant about this, so there was one among them who made a pledge binding on himself that he would not marry, saying: &#8220;As for me, I will not marry women.&#8221; Then that group left and when the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) returned home, his wives informed him of what they heard from that group of people and the pledges they made to themselves. So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) gave a khutbah about this in his masjid, saying: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; (?) &#8211; repeating to the audience what these individuals who came to his house had said. &#8220;This last person will not marry women. The second said he would fast everyday and not go a day without fasting. And the other one said that he will pray all night and not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it was from the Prophet&#8217;s etiquettes when admonishing, reprimanding and teaching the people that he would hide the faults of those who committed errors or sinned (by not mentioning their names). So he would not expose them but rather make such statements like the one you just read above: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such?&#8221; This is because there is no benefit in mentioning the (name of the) person who erred, unless his error involves a large group of people and he is present (for the reminder). But if the people leave and he leaves, the opportunity for reminding them goes away. So in this situation, one must mention that to the people publicly. And it is not like that which is thought by some people who know about wisdom and gentleness when commanding good and forbidding evil, for they do not realize that gentleness does not nullify manifesting the criticism of one who errs if his error involves a group of people. The stories of our Salaf (predecessors), all praise be to Allaah, are filled with reports bearing witness to this fact. It is sufficient for me to just mention what the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) reported in their Saheehs from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, rady Allaahu &#8216;anhu, was giving the Friday khutbah &#8211; naturally in the Prophet&#8217;s masjid &#8211; when a man from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger entered &#8211; and in one narration it states that it was &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan. So &#8216;Umar stopped his khutbah and turned towards this person that had come late and had missed coming early to hear the dhikr and to hear the Jumu&#8217;ah khutah. So the man responded, saying: &#8216;O Commander of the Believers, I did not do anything except hear the Adhaan, make wudoo and then come to the masjid.&#8217; So he said to him reprimanding him in a disapproving interrogating manner: &#8216;The wudoo also, for I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: Whoever goes to (pray) Jumu&#8217;ah, then he should take ghusl (bath).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we derive from this report is that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) reprimanded &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan publicly in front of a large gathering of witnesses because he came late to the Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah and prayer. So therefore: The principle of teaching and reminding someone is based on the foundation of: Hiding the faults of people, unless there is a benefit that requires that it be done in public. This is the principle that the Messenger of Allaah implemented when he gave the khutbah regarding that group of people that had come to his house. So he said: &#8220;What is wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; making an indication of them but not naming anyone of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;As for me…&#8221;, which is a refutation of the essence of what was stated by those people who claimed the reason that the Prophet, had little worship was due to Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins. So he said: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast&#8221; &#8211; meaning I don&#8217;t fast all the time. &#8220;And I pray at night and I also sleep&#8221; &#8211; meaning I do not stay up the whole night, as is done by those extremists amongst worshippers who increase and try to surpass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is why &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said, as is recorded in Saheeh Muslim: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) never stayed up a whole night in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, reminding us that the Religion is moderation and that worhsip is moderation &#8211; neither exaggeration nor negligence: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast. And I pray at night and I also sleep. And I marry women. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah then he is not from me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as it came to us from Islaam, is that which all the Muslims are obligated to adhere to. And I guarantee that if Dawood, who was the best worshipper amongst mankind according to the testimony of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, came after the Prophet&#8217;s being sent with this complete and perfect Islaam, he would not be able to encompass doing all of the Prophet&#8217;s acts of worship. This means all of the acts of worship that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger brought whether through speech, actions or silent approval. Due to this, there remain no grounds for any Muslim to add an act of worship after Allaah completed His Religion by sending His Prophet with this perfect Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after realizing that the Prophet is the best worshipper amongst mankind and the most dutiful and fearing of Allaah amongst them, there should not be anything but following of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). We are upon certainty that we will never be able to encompass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, except for occasionally or at brief periods of time. So we are completely incapable of following and tracing the footsteps of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in his worship. This is impossible &#8211; with respect to every individual amongst mankind after the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there remains nothing before us except that we all strive for two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To learn the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in all matters that came to us from Islaam &#8211; whether in Creed or in Worship or in characteristics and manners. And as I said before, we will never be able to do more than just imitate him, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So imitate (them) if you are not like them,<br>
Verily, imitating the righteous ones is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not for us to imitate anyone amongst mankind except him, because he is the most perfect of humans according to unanimous agreement. And everyone that imitates him after he has gone will be overwhelmed by his ocean of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. This is the first thing &#8211; that we must know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger according to the wide and extensive meaning. This is since the Prophet&#8217;s saying concerning that group of people: &#8220;So whoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from me&#8221;, this sentence in this general hadeeth does not refer to the abandonment of the recommended sunnah acts, for example, that this person is not from the Prophet. This is not what is meant by the hadeeth. Rather, the meaning of the hadeeth is: &#8220;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah&#8221; meaning from my Way and from my Methodology in all affairs of my religious life. This is the kind of person that is not from him. And this kind of person varies with regard to his remoteness from following the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah has two meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A religious Arabic language-based one, and it is that which the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and those who followed his way were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which has occurred in the custom of the Fuqahaa in dividing the worship into two types &#8211; Fard (Obligation) and Sunnah (Recommended). The Sunnah here according to their definition of it is: &#8220;That which the one who does it will be rewarded for and which the one who abandons it will not be punished for.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person that abandons the Messenger&#8217;s Sunnah, with its first meaning &#8211; i.e. his way and methodology &#8211; then this person is in misguidance. And his deviance can either be large or little depending on his closeness or remoteness to following Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). So based on this, we should find ourselves as having no need for amending and introducing a &#8220;good innovation&#8221; (bid&#8217;ah hasanah) into Islaam, claiming that there is nothing wrong with this innovation. This is because we should find ourselves as falling short and being incapable of following the noble Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in everything that has been reported to us concerning his worship, whether it is related to supplications, remembrances or prayers. So it is sufficient for us to just follow him, according to our abilities. Here, I would like to mention a story reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh so that you can realize the worth of Allaah&#8217;s saying: ”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.” [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree reported that one of the Jewish Rabbis went to &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab during the time of his Khilaafah and said to him: &#8220;O Commander of the Believers! There is an ayah in the Book of Allaah that if it had been revealed unto us &#8211; a gathering of Jews &#8211; we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid (holiday).&#8221; So he asked: &#8220;Which ayah is it?&#8221; So the Rabbi mentioned the ayah: &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you…&#8221; So &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;This ayah was indeed revealed on a day of &#8216;Eid, on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah while the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was in &#8216;Arafaat (meaning in his farewell pilgrimage). So this ayah was indeed sent down on a very great day in which there is a combination of two virtues and two &#8216;Eids &#8211; the &#8216;Eid of Jumu&#8217;ah and the &#8216;Eid of &#8216;Arafaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did this Jew say: &#8220;Had it been revealed unto us, we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid?&#8221; It is because he was aware of the greatness of this blessing, which Allaah bestowed upon His servants. But what about us Muslims today? Unfortunately, we do not give this great blessing its due weight in worth. This is why you find many people in the past &#8211; in previous generations &#8211; who have filled the Muslims with prayers, words of remembrance and supplications that the Prophet did not come with. What has come to us from the Prophet is truly sufficient and adequate, in fact it is more than our human capabilities can grasp. However, each one of us takes from this worship what he is able to and what conforms to his capability and capacity.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source:Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb &#8216;alaa As&#8217;ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 141-143) [1]<br>
Taken from al-ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (here in the UK) called Hizb-ut-Tahreer. They call for the Islamic Khilaafah and they speak against the scholars. How can they be refuted and what is the way towards achieving the proper Islamic Khilaafah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be on our prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I testufy that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the issue of partisanship, people are divided into two parties: The party of Ar-Rahmaan (Allaah) and the party of ash-Shaytaan (the Devil). So the party of ar-Rahmaan &#8211; it is not permissible for them to be divided amongst themselves. Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>&#8220;Verily those who divide their Religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jews split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And the Christians split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And my ummah will split up into seventy-three sects.&#8221;</b> This hadeeth was reported by Abu Dawood from the narration of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). Abu Dawood reported a similar hadeeth from Mu&#8217;awiyah but in it there occurs: <b>&#8220;All of them (these sects) will be in the Hellfire, except one sect.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;Who is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> Then he said: <b>&#8220;And there will indeed come a people of whom vain desires will move them just as rabies moves around the one it affects.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) warned us of has already come to pass, for the desires have become many and the parties and groups have multiplied. And Allaah, the Lord of Glory, says in His Noble Book: <b>&#8220;And hold on tightly to the Rope of Allaah, all of you, and be not divided.&#8221;</b> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you, step by step, even if they were to enter the hole of a lizard you would enter into it (after them).&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and the Christians?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Who else?&#8221; And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The beleiver with respect to another beleiver is like a building, each part supports the other.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for these parties, then they chase each other away and they attack one another. In fact, if one were to say: &#8220;These splitting into parties has actualized what the enemies of Islaam have desired from splitting up the ummah, dividing its ranks and weaking its strength&#8221; he would be speaking truthfully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, (I say that) Hizb-ut-Tahreer is a hizb (party) that is wicked. Perhaps you think this is a grave statement since I am the first one to say such a thing, but it is proper that I introduce such a statement. So I say again, it is indeed a wicked party, which began in Jordan. They split away from the Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon, who wrote to them requesting them to return but they refused to go back to them. Their leader was Taqee-ud-Deen an-Nubhaanee. Concerning the matters related to Creed, they say: <b>&#8220;Nothing should be accepted except for that which conforms to the intellect.&#8221;</b> So if there is found some hearing (of a report), then this hearing must be eliminated. That is why they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject that the Dajjaal will be brought forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they have no concern for teaching good etiquettes nor with spreading knowledge. So it is a party that cultivates its followers upon seekiing after and studying politics, which opposes the Religion. And it was once said to the leader of this group: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we see any schools for the memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan in your party?&#8221; So he responded: &#8220;I do not want to produce dervishes!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rely on politics only, and they do not rely on knowledge and etiquettes, nor on the heart-softening narrations. And with regard to issues of Fiqh, they make it permissible for a man to shake hands with a woman that is not related to him. And they say that it is permissible for a woman to be a leader and that she can sit in a governing council (majlis ash-shuraa). In fact they even allow a disbeliever to be in the governing council and that he can be given general leadership positions! So it is a deviant group that has surpassed the extent of deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I am surprised at those who join and adhere to this party. So I advise every brother to stay far away from this group and to warn against it. And if it were not that we make excuses for them, that they misinterpret the texts, we would have said that they were disbelievers because they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject the coming of the Maseeh ad-Dajjaal. And their leader says that he does not like to teach his students the Qur&#8217;aan so that they will not come out as dervishes.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Innovations of Hajj, Umrah and visiting Medina</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I decided to add an appendix, setting forth the innovations regarding Hajj and visiting Madinat-ul-Munawwara, and Bait-ul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) (118) as many people do not know these things and so fall into them &#8211; so I wished to advise them by explaining and warning them against these things &#8211; as Allaah the Blessed and Exalted does not accept any action unless it fulfils two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: That it done sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Honored, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: That it is correct &#8211; and it is not correct until it is in accordance with the Sunnah, not at variance with it &#8211; and as the people of knowledge have agreed &#8211; everything claimed by the people to be part of worship which Rasoolullah did not prescribe by his saying, nor drew nearer to Allaah by performing it &#8211; then that is at variance with his Sunnah as his Sunnah is of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Sunnah of action (Sunnah Fi&#8217;liyyah &#8211; actions which he did) and<br>
(b) Sunnah of neglect (Sunnah Tarkiyyah) &#8211; acts which he did not do)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those things pertain to worship, the Prophet did not do &#8211; then it is from the Sunnah to leave them &#8211; for example: calling Adhaan for the &#8216;Eid prayers and for burying the dead, even though it is a means of making mentioning of Allaah and glorifying Him, it is not permissible do it as a means of drawing nearer to Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious &#8211; and that is only because it is something which Rasoolullah refrained from doing &#8211; and this point was understood by his companions &#8211; so they often warred against innovation in general &#8211; as is mentioned in its proper place &#8211; and Hudhaufah ibn al Yamaan (ra) said: &#8220;Every worship that has not been done by the companions of Rasoolullah, then do not do it.&#8221; And Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (ra)said: &#8220;Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate, and that is enough for you &#8211; stick to the old way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how fortunate is the one to whom Allaah gives the good fortune of making his worship sincerely for Him and following of the Sunnah of His Prophet (sas) in it &#8211; not mixing it with innovation &#8211; for such a one then let him have good tidings of Allaah&#8217;s acceptance of his obedience &#8211; and his admission to His Paradise. May Allah make us those who bear the word and follow the best of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should know that these innovations are traceable to the following factors:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Weak (da&#8217;eef) Ahaadith &#8211; which are not permitted to be used as evidence, nor is it, according to your saying, permissible to act on them &#8211; as I have explained in the introduction of &#8216;Sifat-Salaat un-Nabee&#8217; (The Prophet&#8217;s Manner of Prayer) &#8211; and this is the position of a group of the people of knowledge &#8211; from them Ibn Taimiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Fabricated (maudoo&#8217;) Ahaadith &#8211; or narrations which have no basis &#8211; some scholars remaining unaware of their true nature &#8211; and therefore basing religious verdicts upon them &#8211; their being the core of innovation and novelties!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The decisions of some scholars or their regarding certain things to be commendable &#8211; especially the later scholars &#8211; not basing these on any proofs (from the Qur&#8217;an of Sunnah), rather treating them as indisputable matters &#8211; until they become Sunnahs adhered to and followed. And it will not remain hidden from one who has insight into his religion &#8211; that it is not correct to follow such things -as nothing is part of the Sharee&#8217;ah except what Allaah has prescribed &#8211; and it is enough for the one who makes something desirable &#8211; if he is mujtahid &#8211; that it is permissible for him to act according to what he sees as desirable &#8211; and that Allaah will not punish him for that &#8211; But as for other people taking that as something prescribed and as Sunnah &#8211; then not definitely not! And how can that be when some of these things conflict with the Sunnah &#8211; as will be noted later of Allaah wills?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) Customs and superstitions which have no evidence from the Sharee&#8217;ah, and are not even supported by the intellect &#8211; even if some ignorant people act upon them and take them to be part of the sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; sometimes finding support from others &#8211; sometimes from some people claiming to be from the people of knowledge &#8211; and actually having their appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that the danger of these innovations is not of one level &#8211; rather they are of different degrees. Some of them being clear shirk and kufr &#8211; as you will see, and some of them are less than that &#8211; however, you must be aware that the slightest innovation that someone brings into the religion is haraam (forbidden) after it is exposed as an innovation &#8211; as there is no innovation that is only makrooh (disapproved), as some people think &#8211; and how can that be when Rasoolullah (sas) said: &#8220;Every innovation is a going astray. And every going astray is in the Fire&#8221;. That is the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam ash-Shaatibee has fully explained this point in his important book &#8216;Al I&#8217;tisaam&#8217; &#8211; and because of this the innovation is something very dangerous &#8211; and most people remain heedless of this, except for a small group of the people of knowledge and enough as a proof of the seriousness of innovation is the saying of the Prophet : &#8220;Verily Allah has refused to admit the repentance of anyone committing an innovation, until he gives up the innovation&#8221;. Narrated by Tabraanee and ad-Diyaa-ul-Maqdisee in &#8216;al Ahaadith ul-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others &#8211; with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and was declared by al-Mundharee to be hasan. (119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I complete this with word of advice which I convey to the readers from a great Imaam from the first scholars of the Muslims &#8211; Shaikh Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali al Barbahaaree &#8211; one of the companions of Imaam Ahmad &#8211; and died in the year 329 H, he &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: &#8220;And beware of the smallest of the newly-invented matters, as the small innovations due to repetition become large innovations, and in that way every innovation introduced in this Ummah began as a small innovation &#8211; resembling something correct and thus is the one who falls into it enticed &#8211; then he is not able to leave it &#8211; some of it grows and becomes part of the religion, practiced as such. So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; everything that people of your time say and do not made haste (in accepting it) until you ask and find out: Did any of the companions of the Prophet or any of the people of knowledge speak about it? So if you find a narration from the, then accept it and do not leave it for anything &#8211; and do not prefer anything- and do not prefer anything over it and thus fall into the Fire. And you should know &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; that a worshipper&#8217;s Islaam is not complete until he is follower (of proof), consenting and submitting (to the Truth). So whoever claims that anything remains of Islaam which the companions of Rasoolullah did not fully explain to us &#8211; then he has invented a lie against them, and that is enough for him that he has reviled them &#8211; so he is an innovator, misguided and misguiding, introducing into Islaam what does not belong to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Al-Albaani) say : And may Allah have mercy upon Imaam Maalik who said : &#8220;The last part of this Ummah will not be corrected except by that which corrected its beginning, so that which was not part of the religion then &#8211; is not part of the religion today.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allah send blessing upon our Prophet (sas) who said : &#8220;I have not left any thing that will draw you nearer to Allah &#8211; except that I have enjoined it upon you. And I have not left anything that will take you away from Allah and draw you to the Fire except that I have forbidden it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah by Whose blessing Good actions are completed.</p>

And I have found also that Ibn Taimiyyah explains that to mean singling out &#8216;Umrah in his journey and Hajj in his journey. See Majmood al-Fataawaa, Vol.26 as it is important.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">8. It is the face-cover worn upon the tip of the nose. And it is of different types. If she pulls it up to her eyes then it is called &#8216;Al-Waswasah&#8217; or &#8216;Al-Burqa&#8217;. If she pulls it down to below the eye socket then it is &#8216;Al-Niqaab&#8217;, and if it is upon the end of her nose it is &#8216;Al-Lukfaam&#8217;. It is called the woman&#8217;s niqaab because it hides her colour of the niqaab (Lisaan ul &#8216;Arab 2/265-266).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">9. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in his &#8216;Mansik'(p.365): &#8220;And the gloves(Quffaazaat) are a covering made for the hand- like falconers wear&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">10. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in his &#8216;Mansik&#8217;: &#8220;And he should not cut them down to below the ankle, as the Prophet ordered with this to begin with, then made allowance for not doing do in &#8216;Arafaat, when allowed one not finding an izaar to wear trousers, and allowing one who does not find sandals to wear leather socks(khuff). This is the most authentic saying of the scholars&#8221;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">44. Shaikh ul Islaam ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;As for the other parts of the House, and the Place of Ibraheem, and whatever is in the rest of the world mosques and their walls, and the graves of the prophets and good people &#8211; like the room of our Prophet, and cave of Ibraheem, and the place where our Prophet used to pray &#8211; and all other such places, and the rock at Jerusalem, then none of these are to be touched at all or kissed &#8211; by total agreement of the scholars. And as for tawaaf of these things &#8211; then it is one of the greatest and most forbidden bid&#8217;ahs &#8211; and he who takes that as part of his religion should be asked to repent &#8211; and if he refuses he killed&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (no.8945) and AHmad and al-Baihaqi port from Ya&#8217;laa ibn Umayyah who said: &#8220;I made tawaaf with Umar ibn ul-Khattaab ( and in a narration: with &#8216;Uthuzza) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; so when I came to the corner of the Door I started to touch it so he said &#8216;Have you not made tawaaf with Rasoolullaah?&#8217; I said: Yes. He said: &#8216;Then did you see him touch it?&#8217; I said: No. He said: &#8216;Then do likewise for there is for you in Rasoolullah a good example'&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">45. This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138. And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">46. At-Tirmidhee and others, and the other narration is Tabraanis. And it is Saheeh: See also &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.21). Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;And there is no particular dhikr narrated from the Prophet, not by his order, or his saying, or by his teaching, rather he should make du&#8217;aa with any authentic du&#8217;aas &#8211; and the particular du&#8217;aas which many people mention like that for below the water-spout, etc. &#8211; there is no basis for them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">48. Bukharee and Muslim from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, and Bukharee from Jaabir &#8211; and the addition is his. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.191).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">49. See the Introduction and the Original Book, (pp.21,23 and 135).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">50. Saheeh hadith &#8211; as a number of scholars have said. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1123) and &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">51. Saheeh hadith narrated by at-Tayaalisee and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">52. Narrated by &#8216;ad-Diyaa&#8217; in &#8216;Al-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">53. It is not easy these days to see the Ka&#8217;bah except from certain points on as-Safa; it can be seen from the pillar which supports the second storey of the mosque, so he who is able to do so has attained the Sunnah, and if not then let him try his best and there is no harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">54. (An-Nawawi) adds in &#8216;Al-Adhkaar&#8217;: Laa ilaaha illallaahu walaa na&#8217;budu illaa iyyaahu, and I do not find this addition in any narration of the hadith- either Muslim or anyone else who records the hadith&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">55. That is after the tahleels &#8211; making du&#8217;aa for whatever he wishes from the good of this world and the Hereafter &#8211; and the best thing is that it should be something reported from the Prophet or the pious predecessors (ssalaf ul-Saalih).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">56. And contrary to what some mistakenly say it is a sahih hadith. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1072).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">57. Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Hajj ul-Kabeer. Note:The following text appears in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee (3/394): &#8220;And all the woman&#8217;s tawaaf and sa&#8217;ee is done walking, Ibn al-Mundhir says: Scholars are agreed that there is no reaml(walking quickly) upon the women around the Ka&#8217;bah or between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; nor uncovering the right shoulder (idtibaa&#8217;). And that is because the principle of it is uncovering the skin &#8211; and that is not desired from women &#8211; what is required from them is to cover &#8211; and in walking quickly (raml) and idtibaa&#8217; uncovering occurs.&#8221; And in &#8216;Al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawee(8/75) there appears what shows that there is difference of opinion in the matter between the Shafi&#8217;i scholars, he says:&#8221; There are two sayings in that. Firstly, and this is correct upon which the Jumhoor (majority) of scholars agree: That she should not run at all &#8211; but walk whether in the night or day. Secondly, that it is mutahabb for her to run at night when there is no one around (to see her) in the place of running &#8211; just as for men.&#8221; I (Al-Albanee) say: &#8220;And perhaps that is more cprrect &#8211; as the origin of sa&#8217;ee (running) is the sa&#8217;ee of Haajar mother of Imaa&#8217;eel &#8211; seeking water for her thirsty son as occurs in the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas: &#8220;And she found as-Safaa to be the nearest hill to her so she stood upon it, then turned towards the river-bed to see if she could see anyone &#8211; so she went down from as-Safaa till she reached the river-bed, raising up the border of her dress &#8211; and running fast till she crossed the river-bed then she came to Marwah and stood upon it to see if she could see anyone, and she could not see anyone &#8211; and she did that seven times. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: The Prophet said:&#8217;And that is the sa&#8217;ee of the people between these two'&#8221;. (Narrated by Bukharee in the Book of the Prophets)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">58. As for seeing the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it is not possible now because of the building between it and the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; so should try his best to face the Ka&#8217;bah and not do as the confused people do, who raise up their eyes and hands to the sky!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">59. Narrated by Abu Nu&#8217;aim in his &#8216;Mustakhraj of Sahih Muslim&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">60. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaibah(4/68.69) from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; May Allah be pleased with them &#8211; with two sahih isnaads. And from Al-Musayyib ibn Raafi&#8217; al-Kaahilee and &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair. And at-Tabraani narrates it from the Prophet but its isnaad is da&#8217;eef (weak) &#8211; &#8216;Al-Mujmi'(3/248).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">61. Or shaves it if there is sufficient time between his &#8216;Umrah and Hajj for his hair to grow enough (see Fath ul Baari,3/444).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">62. Narrated by Bukharee and Muslim</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">63. 64. 63,64. This stopping and that after it may be difficult to perform these days due to the crowd of people, so if he goes past it to &#8216;Arafah then it is alright insh&#8217;allah. Shaikh ul Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in &#8216;al-Fataawaa&#8217; (26:128): As for that which is from the sunnah of Rasoolullah &#8211; staying in Minaa on Yaum -ut-Tarwiyyah and for that night, then stopping at &#8216;Urahah&#8217;, which is between the Mash&#8217;ar ul Haraam and going from there to &#8216;Arafah, and the giving of Khutbah and the two prayers on the way in the middle of &#8216;Uranah&#8217;- then this is as agreed upon by scholars &#8211; whereas many writers do not bring it to notice &#8211; and most people do not know due to the prevalence of invented practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">65. I say: &#8220;And also it is not reported that the Prophet prayed anything before Zuhr or after &#8216;Asr in this place &#8211; or in any of his journeys &#8211; and it is not established that he prayed any supplementary prayers in any of his journeys except the two sunnahs of Fajr and the Witr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">66. Bukharee narrates it from Ibn &#8216;Umar with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. See &#8216;Mukhtasar-al-Bukhari'(3/89/25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">67. Hasan or Sahih hadith. With more than one isnaad &#8211; refer to &#8216;As-Saheehah,(no.1503)&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">68. As that is established from the Prophet &#8211; as is explained in the Original.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">69. Narrated by Muslim and others. See &#8216;At-Targheeb'(2/129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">70. Narrated by AHmad and others &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;Takhreej ut-Targheeb&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">71. This was said ny Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, its being established from the Prophet and his companions, in al-Bukhari (25/94/801) (Mukhtasar al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">72. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And when he reaches Muzdalifah he prays Maghrib before making the camels kneel down if possible, then after making them kneel they pray &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; and if they delay the &#8216;Ishaa somewhat then there is no harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">73. As for the addition &#8220;Allahummaj&#8217;alhu Hajjan mabrooran&#8230;.&#8221; which some writers mention &#8211; it is not established from the Prophet as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Daee&#8217;fah&#8217; (no.1107).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">74. Narrated in Ibn Khuzaimah&#8217;s &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; &#8211; where he says: Hadith saheeh, and explaining with this narration what is unclear in others and that what is intended by &#8216;until he stoned Jamrat ul &#8216;Aqabah&#8217; is &#8216;finished stoning it&#8217; (Fath ul Baaree, no.1426).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">75. And this point has been fully explained in the Original &#8211; so refer to that if you wish to receive the proof of the matter (p.30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">76. And this hadith is sahih and has been authenticated by a number of scholars, from among them Ibn ul Qayyim, as I have explained in &#8216;Sahih Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1745). And when some of the distinguished scholars came upon this hadith before the spread of this treatise- they regarded it as something strange &#8211; some of them quickly declaring it to be weak &#8211; as I myself did in some of my earlier works &#8211; based upon Abu Dawud&#8217;s isnaad &#8211; eventhough Ibn ul Qayyim strengthened it in his &#8216;Tahdheeb&#8217; of Abi Dawud, and as did Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) in &#8216;At-Talkhees&#8217; &#8211; by keeping silent about it. And I have found other chains of narration for it which will convince anyone looking into the matter of its being raised from the level of da&#8217;eef to level of its being saheeh. However due to there being in a reference work not in common use by the large majority &#8211; and that is Imaam at-Tahaawis &#8216;Sharh Ma&#8217;aanee ul &#8216;Athaar&#8217;- these people quickly declared its something strange or being da&#8217;eef and they were encouraged in this by the fact that they found that some of the earlier scholars had said: &#8216;And I do not know any scholar who has ruled according to that.&#8217; And that is a negation of something &#8211; it is not a piece of definite known amongst the scholars that lack of knowledge of something does not mean absence of knowledge of it. So when a hadith is established to have come from Rasoolullah and is a relevant proof &#8211; as this is &#8211; then it is obligatory to act upon it straight away, not waiting to see if the scholars know of it or not, just as Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee said &#8220;A narration is to be accepted as soon as it is confirmed even if none of the scholars are acting upon it like the narrations which they accept &#8211; for the hadith of Rasoolullah is confirmed on its own not by anyone&#8217;s acting on it afterwards.&#8221; I say: So the hadith of Rasoolullah is above needing to be attested to by the actions of scholars according to it, as it is a source (of knowledge) by itself, judging not being judged. And along with that, indeed, some of the scholars have acted upon this particular hadith &#8211; from them &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair &#8211; the greatest Taabi&#8217;ee &#8211; so can there remain any excuse for anyone to leave action according to this hadith: So verily therein is a warning for any who have a perceptive heart or listens attentively. And this is more fully explained in the Original. And you should be aware that the stoning of the Jamrah is for the pilgrims as the &#8216;Eid prayer for the rest of the people, therefore, Imaam AHmad liked that the time for the &#8216;Eid prayer in different parts should be that of the time of sacrifice in Minaa, And the Prophet gave Khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice after the stoning just as he used to give the Khutbah in Madinah after &#8216;Eid prayer &#8211; so some people holding it as being desirable to offer &#8216;Eid prayer in Minaa, taking as their evidence the word of general profs or analogy &#8211; is a mistake and neglect of the Sunnah &#8211; As neither the Prophet nor the khulafaa after him ever prayed the &#8216;Eid prayer at Minaa. See &#8216;Fatawaa Ibn Taimiyyah'(26:180).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">77. I say: And there is in this hadith two great allowancesfor the pilgrims &#8211; and a solution for most of the problems of the piling up of slaughtered animals in the slaughter- house &#8211; which has led to those in control there to have to bury some in the earth &#8211; and he who wishes to see the matter more fully laid out should return to the Original (pp.82-988).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">78. And there is a hadith from the Prophet narrated by Jaabir &#8211; reported by Abu Dawud and others &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa'(no.1138) and another by Baihaqee (9/289). And it is narrated from Ibn &#8216;Umar that he liked the animal to be made to face the Qiblah when slaughtered. And Abdur-Razzaaq(no.8585) narrates with sahih isnaad from ibn &#8216;Umar, that he disliked to eat from an animal slaughtered facing other than the Qiblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">79. Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) says (10/16): &#8220;That it will be easier for the one slaughtering to take the knife in his right hand, and to hold its head with his left.&#8221; I say: And causing it to die down and placing the foot on its side is what is narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">80. Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1550). And there is after it a supporting hadith from Ibn&#8217;Umar like it &#8211; narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">81. Narrated by Maalik with sahih isnaad reaching Ibn &#8216;Umar and Bukharee brings it in a chapter heading while signifying its authenticity Mukhtasar of Bukharee no.330).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">82. Reported by Abu Dawud and others narrated by Jaabir &#8211; and it has support from the hadith of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al Khudnee reported by Abu Ya&#8217;laa &#8211; as occurs in &#8216;al-Majma&#8217; (4/22) &#8211; see &#8220;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1118).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">83. Reported by Muslim and others from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa&#8217; &#8211; and Ibn Taimiyyah in his book &#8216;Al-Mansik&#8217; added: &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..(As You accepted from Ibrahim whom You took as a chosen friend)&#8221;, and I cannot find it in any of the books of Sunnah which are with me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">84. Reported by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad (see Glossary). Its isnaad is joined by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1700,1701).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">85. Reported by AHmad, authenticated by Ibn Hibbaan, and I hold it to be authentic due to its multiple lines of transmission. See &#8216;As-Saheehah'(no.2476).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">86. Al Qaani&#8217; is the one who asks. And Al Mu&#8217;tarr is the one who begs by displaying the weakness of his body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">87. Narrated by Bukharee and others. See &#8216;Irwa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.964). As for Ibn Taimiyyah&#8217;s saying (p.388) &#8220;And the Mutamatti&#8217; must fast part of the three days before putting of the iHraam for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyya&#8221; &#8211; I do not know any proof for it. Rather it seems to go against the clear meaning of the ayah and hadith, and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">88. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1084).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">89. Reported by Muslim and others, see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1089), and Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1730). And this is one of those matters in which Ibn al Hammaam the Hanaafi scholar agrees that the Hanaafi scholars have gone against the Sunnah. So what have the blind followers to say of that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">90. Sahih hadith &#8211; &#8216;Al Ahaadith us-Saheehah&#8217; (no.605), Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1732).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">91. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And if he shortens it he draws it together and shortens it up to the length of a finger joint or less &#8211; or more, and the woman does not shorten in excess of that &#8211; as for the man he may shorten it as much as he pleases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">92. Report by Bukharee and Abu Dawud from a number of the companions &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1705,1707,1709,1710) and &#8216;Mukhtasar ul-Bukharee&#8217; (no.847).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">93. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad &#8211; connected by Abu Dawud. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1700) and &#8216;Irwaa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.1064).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">94. 95. 94,95. Narrated by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1710)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">96. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Ibn Abi Shaibah and others. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee&#8217; (no.319,1/p.386).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">97. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Abdur-Razzaaq. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee'(no.318).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">98. Narrated by &#8216;Abd ur-Razzaaq (no.9012) with sahih isnaad from Ibn &#8216;Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">99. I say: And Allaah knows better which of them Rasoolullah did &#8211; and it may be that he prayed twice with them &#8211; the first being Fard and the second nafl as he did in some of his battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">100. 101. 102. 100,101,102. All of this is established in the hadith of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; and as for what occurs in some Hajj books that he should face the Qiblah upon stoning Jamrat-ul-Aqabah, then that contradicts this authentic hadith &#8211; and whatever contradicts it is shaadh (Glossary), or rather munkar (Glossary) as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah'(no.4864).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">103. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;So if the sun sets and he is still in Minaa &#8211; then he must remain for the stoning on the third day&#8221;. I say: And the great majority of scholars agree on that &#8211; contrary to what Ibn Hazm says in &#8216;Al-Muhallaa&#8217; (7.185). And An-Nawaawi drives proof for them(the majority) from what is understood from Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: faman ta&#8217;ajjala fee yaumaini falaa ithma &#8216;alaihi (8:283): &#8220;And the day (al-Yaum) is a name for the daytime not including the night&#8221;. And using what is confirmed from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullah who both said : &#8220;Whoever is at Minaa on the second day and the evening comes upon him &#8211; then let him stay until the next day and leave together with the people.&#8221; And the wording of &#8216;Al-Muwatta&#8217; from Ibn &#8216;Umar is: &#8220;Then let him not leave until he has stoned the Jamaraat on the next day.&#8221; And Imaam Muhamad in his Muwatta (p.233) narrates it from Imaam Maalik and says: &#8220;And that is what we accept, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah and people in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">104. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1097). And I have pointed out there that my narrating it as being from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in the Original is a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">105. Reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah &#8211; and authenticated by a group of the scholars. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1080).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">106. Hadith hasan reported by Al-Bazzaar and Al-Baihaqi and others from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; Ibn Hajr declaring its isnaad to be hasan, and it has supporting narrations which I have quoted in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (No.2477).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">107. Reported with Mu&#8217;allaq isnaad by Bukharee (Mukhtasar al Bukharee, no.287) joined by a number of scolars whom I have named in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no.803).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">108. Reported by Tabraani and Diyaa-al-Maqdisee in &#8216;Al-Mukhtara&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Mundhari&#8217; declares its isnaad to be hasan. And it is as he said as it has another chain of transmission as I have shown in &#8216;Tahdheer us-Saajid&#8230;&#8217; (pp.106-107 2nd edition).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">109. Reported by AHmad and others from the hadith of Jaabir from the Prophet with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars whom I have mentioned in &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">110. Reported by Tirmidhee and others &#8211; authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Mishkaat&#8217; (no.258) and &#8216;at-Targheeb&#8217; (no.2/120,122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">111. Reported by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhee, an-Nasaaiee Ibn Maaja and others &#8211; authenticated by Tirmidhee and al-Haakim and adh-Dhahbee &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.481).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">112. Reported by Muslim and others &#8211; and a similar hadith by Bukharee. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1086) and &#8216;Saheeh Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1747).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">113. Established in the hadith of al-Haarith Ibn &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Aus, reported by AHmad and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1749)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">114. Reported by AHmad with a sahih isnaad to the standard of Bukharee and Muslim &#8211; who also both narrate a similar hadith &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1086). And they also narrate a witness to it from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1748).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">115. Reported by Bukharee in his &#8216;Taareeq and Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan &#8211; from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;isha &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with her &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Ahaadeeth-as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">116. Reported by Baihaqi with a good sahih isnaad from Jaabir &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. And it has an authentic mursal narration as a witness to it reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq in his &#8216;Musannaf'(no.9127). And Ibn Taimiyyah narrates that the salaf used to transport it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">117. See note 24.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">118. May Allaah return it and the rest of the Muslim land to them, and may Allah inspire them to work with the rulings of the religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">119. See &#8216;Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1620)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">120. And this innovation was stopped many years ago-al-hamdulillah-however the one after it remains in its place and in Al-Baajoorees explanation of Ibn ul-Qaasim (1/41) there occurs: &#8220;And it is forbidden to go for a pleasure trip to see the carrying of the Ka&#8217;bahs covering and the coverings of the Station of Ibrahim,etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">121. And this and the one after it are some of the most wicked innovations because of what they contain regarding use of tricks to get around the shaaree&#8217;ah and the risk of falling into shameful actions as is obvious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">122. see 121.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">123. And it is authentically reported from &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; that he saw some people while on the way to Hajj going to a certain place, so he said: What is this? So it was said: A place where Rasoolullah prayed. So he said: In this way where the People of the Book destroyed. They took the places connected with there Prophets as a place of prayer. Whomsoever of you reaches such a place at the time of prayer then let him pray, otherwise he should not do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">124. This appears to refer to wiping the face and chest with the two hands resembling a cross.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">125. For the greeting for the Haraam Mosque is tawaaf, then the praying behind the Station of Ibrahim and has preceded from the Prophet, from his action. And see &#8216;Al-Qawaa&#8217;id an-Nooraneeyah&#8217; of Ibn Taimiyyah (pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">126. What has been authentically reported as a practice of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar is the same that has preceded (see point no.55).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">127. This du&#8217;aa besides being a novelty also contains that which contradicts the sunnah and that is using as a means of approach to Allaah the &#8216;right of the Mush&#8217;ar-ul-Haraam and the ka&#8217;bah &#8230;&#8217;but rather than one should use Allaahs names and attributes as a means of approach (wasilah) to Him. And the Hanafi scholars have declared that is hated to say: &#8220;Allaah I ask You by the right of the Mash&#8217;aral Haraam&#8230;etc&#8221; As occurs in &#8216;Haashiyat Ibn &#8216;Aa-bideen&#8217; and other books. see &#8216;at-Tawassul&#8217; Anwa&#8217;uhu wa ah-kaamuhu&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">128. And this is one of the worst innovations because of what it involves regarding twisting the shari&#8217;ah which is clearly shown in the Book and Sunnah merely on account of opinion. And the chief responsibility for the lack of total use of the meat lies upon the pilgrims themselves, because they do not when sacrificing take account of the directions of the Wise Legislator &#8211; as is shown in the Original (pg.87-88)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">129. And the Sunnah is to go to visit the mosqe as the Prophet said: do not journey accept to three mosques&#8230;so when he reaches it and prays upon entering then he may go to the grave. And it should be known that traveling to visit his grave &#8211; peace and blessings be upon him &#8211; and other graves is one thing, and visiting without traveling is something else &#8211; contrary to what has become widespread amongst the later people &#8211; among them holders of doctorates who have confused the two &#8211; and have further declared that Ibn Taimiyyah in particular and the salafis in general deny the authenticity of visiting the Prophets graves &#8211; and this is a clear untruth. See the matter fully explained in our refutation of Doctor Bootee who produced a succession of such sayings in the magazine &#8216;Islamic civilization&#8217;. Then I produced a particular treatise called &#8216;in defense of the Prophetic hadith&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">130. And al-Ghazali-may Allaah have mercy upon him-did well in speaking against this kissing (1/244) and said: &#8220;it is a habit of Christians and Jews&#8221; So is there anyone to take heed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">131. And what is correct is to say: &#8220;assalaamu&#8217;alaika yaa rasoolullaahi wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika yaa abaa bakr &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika ya &#8216;umar&#8221; as Ibn &#8216;Umar used to. And if he adds something slight as he feels at the time &#8211; not always doing it &#8211; then it is alright insha&#8217;Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">132. And this is in addition to its being an innovation and exaggeration in religion, and in contradiction to the Prophet&#8217;s saying: Do not take my grave as a festival, and send blessings upon me and it is a reason for many Sunnahs being lost and many benefits &#8211; and that it is the dhikr after the prayer recited after giving salaam &#8211; for they leave all of these and hurry to this innovation So may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: &#8220;No innovation is brought to life except that a Sunnah is killed off &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">133. And there is absolutely no benefit in these two as they were only put there for decoration and to charm the people &#8211; and they have lately been removed &#8211; alhamdulillaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">134. And the hadith about that id da&#8217;eef &#8211; and cannot be an evidence for it is as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217; (no.364). So it is not permissible to act on it as it is Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; especially as it may cause trouble to some pilgrims as I myself once found &#8211; thinking that the hadith about it was authentic &#8211; and he might miss some prayers and thus be a hardship &#8211; which Allaah has delivered him from. And one honorable person holds this hadith to be strong &#8211; based upon the attestation of Ibn Hibbaan in favour of one of its unknown narrators &#8211; and the scholars of Hadith criticism do not accept this type of attestation. Among them the aforementioned honorable person as he himself has stated in his refutation of Shaikh al-Ghumaaree in the &#8216;Journal of the Salafi University&#8217; which comes from India. See the Book of Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-Rabee&#8217;aan in reply to him, as he has written well and is of benefit and explains the mistakes regarding supporting this hadith and the contradictions involved.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Fataawaa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij Ad-Da’wiyyah (pg. 51-55)<br>
Compiled by Hasan Ibn Mahmood Ibn Mansoor ad-Daghreeri.<br>
Taken from Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> &#8220;Noble Shaikh Ahmad Ibn Yahyaa An-Najmee, may Allaah give you tawfeeq, there are found some books that include talk about these hizbee groups, which have incorporated a methodology that opposes the methodology of the Salaf in the fields of knowledge and action. And these books fall in between that which is large and difficult for the beginner to grasp of its content and between that which is short and contains little benefit. So O Shaikh, we hope that you can give us a clear but brief image of the most prominent of some of these methodologies’ founders and some of the issues they are criticized in. This is so that the Muslims can beware of falling into any part of that. And if you would be so kind O Shaikh as to direct the last of your talk to focusing on the true methodology, which every Muslim is obligated to follow&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> All praise be to Allaah, and may His peace and blessings be upon the most honorable of all creation, our prophet Muhammad, and on his family and Companions. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa&#8217;at-ul-Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Definition of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the followers of Hasan Al-Bannaa. There are several points to be noted about their methodology, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They show a lack of importance to Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah [1], which is the most important matter in Islaam, since the Islaam of an individual is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They remain silent and concede to the people in their performance of major Shirk, supplication to other than Allaah, performance of tawaaf around graves, making oaths to the dead in the graves, sacrificing in their names and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this methodology was a Sufi. He had a connection with Sufism to the point that he gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Al-Khusaafee upon (following) his Khusaafee Shadh-lee order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The presence of innovations amongst them and their worshipping Allaah through them &#8211; even to the point that the founder of this methodology acknowledged that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would attend their gatherings of dhikr and that he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would forgive what past sins they had committed, as is found in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;May Allaah bless the one who upon light in which he appeared<br>
To the worlds, and so he surpassed the sun and the moon<br>
This habeeb (i.e. Muhammad) along with his beloved has gathered<br>
And pardoned everyone in what sins they did in the past.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They call to establishing the Khilaafah and this is an innovation because the Messengers and their followers were not entrusted with anything except to call to Tawheed. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger, (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah and avoid the taaghoot (false deities).’&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They have a lack of Walaa and Baraa (loyalty and disavowment) or a weak form of it. This is made clear in their call to bring closeness between the Sunnis and the Shee’ah. And their founder was quoted as saying: &#8220;We will cooperate with one another in what we agree on and pardon one another in what we disagree on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. They hate and despise the people of Tawheed and those who adhere to the Salafee Way. This is made clear in their talk concerning the Saudi state, which is founded upon Tawheed and which teaches Tawheed in its schools, institutes and universities. And it was made clear in their killing of Jameel Ar-Rahmaan Al-Afghaanee just because he called to Tawheed and because he had schools in which he would teach Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. They pursue the mistakes of the leaders and expose their faults &#8211; whether true or false &#8211; spreading them amongst the youth in order to make the leaders appear hateful to them and so that they can fill their hearts with contempt against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. They hold detestable partisanship to the party they ascribe themselves to. So they show friendship based on this party and they show enmity based on this party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They give their oath of allegiance to work for the Ikhwaani Manhaj according to the ten conditions that the founder has set forth. And there are other issues of concern, which perhaps can be dealt with at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Qutubees</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that have read the books of Sayyid Qutb and accepted what is in them from truth and falsehood. So you will find them defending Sayyid Qutb when someone criticizes him, even if the truth is with the one criticizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known that Sayyid Qutb was not from the men of religious knowledge. His original status was that he was an author. Then he adopted the beliefs of the Ash&#8217;arees &#8211; the belief of ta&#8217;weel (misinterpretation of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes), as did others among the learned people from Egypt. He has serious and vile errors, which the people of knowledge have refuted and exposed. But when they expose these errors, this results in the rage of the Qutubees befalling them by way of their criticizing, speaking ill and discrediting them. So Allaah is sufficient for us and He is the Best of Guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the basic principle is that: Men are known by way of the Haqq (truth) and the Haqq is not known by way of men. So it is obligatory on us to accept the truth and to worship Allaah, Lord of all worlds, by it, and to abandon everyone that treads an innovated methodology. And we must place as our role model, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), his Khulafaa, his Companions, and those who followed them amongst the Imaams of guidance. And Allaah is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Suroorees</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims &#8211; all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers. Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa&#8217;at-ut-Tableegh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that follow Muhammad Ilyaas, the founder of this Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A biography of the founder: Muhammad Ilyaas was born in 1302H. He memorized the Qur’aan and read the Six Collections of Hadeeth. [2] He was upon the Deobandi methodology, taking the Hanafee madh-hab, the Ash’aree and Matureedee Creed and the Sufi way. They have four Sufi orders amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Naqshabandees<br>
2. The Sahroordees<br>
3. The Qaadirees, and<br>
4. The Jishtees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyaas gave the Sufi bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to Shaikh Rasheed Al-Kankoohee, who later became Shaikh Rasheed As-Saharanpuree. Then he renewed it with Shaikh Ahmad As-Saharanpuree who certified him to take oaths of allegiance. Muhammad Ilyaas would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee, in what is known as the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation). And he would go out to the grave of ‘Abdul-Qudoos Al-Kankoohee, the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood [3] on him. He resided and taught in Delhi and passed away in 1363H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Circumstances that brought about the start of the movement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Hasan An-Nadwee saw that Muhammad Ilyaas took refuge in this way of giving Da’wah when the ways of blind-following failed to rectify the people of his region. Shaikh Miyaan Muhammad Aslam quotes one of Ilyaas’ sayings that he received kashf (mystic disclosure) to follow this way through a dream in which he was inspired with a new tafseer (interpretation) of Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8220;You were the best nation brought out for mankind, commanding good and forbidding evil and believing in Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] And it was that going out (khurooj) to call people to the way of Allaah cannot be realized by staying in one place based on Allaah’s word <b>&#8220;brought out&#8221;</b> and that one’s Eemaan increases by going out in this khurooj based on Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8220;and believing in Allaah&#8221;</b> after having said: <b>&#8220;brought out for mankind.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following can be noted from what has just been mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Qur’aan is not interpreted by makshoofaat (mystical disclosures), and by Sufi dreams, of which the majority of them, rather all of them come from the inspirations of the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is apparent from what was stated previously that the founder of this Jamaa’ah was engrossed in Sufism from head to toe. This is because he gave two oaths of allegiance on it and was tested by its false beliefs and because he would spend his time sitting by the graves of Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a qubooree (grave worshipper) and a khuraafee. This is clear from his saying: &#8220;&#8230;and he would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee.&#8221; And concerning the second person, he mentioned that he forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him. So his being attached to the grave of the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him is without doubt a clear proof that he held that same belief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Those who believe in wahdat-ul-wujood claim that Allaah embodies Himself inside the attractive woman &#8211; and refuge is sought from Allaah! This is a matter that has reached the highest level of repulsiveness. May Allaah give them what they deserve of His curses and wrath!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The methodology of the Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh can be summarized in six issues or six principles or six characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Actualizing the statement of Tawheed: <i>&#8220;Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah&#8221;</i> (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad is His Messenger)<br>
2. Praying with full submissiveness and humility<br>
3. Knowledge of the Virtues (<i>Fadaa’il</i>) and not the Fiqh issues (<i>Masaa’il</i>) along with knowledge of dhikr<br>
4. Showing generosity to the Muslim<br>
5. Correcting the intention<br>
6. Calling to Allaah (i.e. Da’wah) and going out (i.e. khurooj) for that purpose in the Way of Allaah upon the tablighi manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an objective behind each of these six principles or characteristics as well as a virtue to be attained. So for example the objective behind (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>) is to: &#8220;Eradicate the corrupted yaqeen (Certainty) from the heart while placing the correct and valid yaqeen into the Essence (dhaat) of Allaah.&#8221; They really intend the belief of wahdat-ul-wujood with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point to be noted about Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was raised upon Sufism and gave two oaths of allegiance on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He would position himself by graves, waiting to receive Kashf (Sufi mystical disclosure) and meditative ideas from the deceased inside them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He would perform the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation) at the gravesite of ‘Abdul-Quddoos Al-Kankoohee, who used to believe in wahadat-ul-wujood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Jishtee Muraaqabah is to sit by a grave for half an hour of every week, covering the face and reciting this dhikr: &#8220;Allaahu Haadiree, Allaahu Naadhiree.&#8221; [4] This statement or this action if done sincerely for Allaah is an innovation. And if it is done for the person in the grave then it is committing Shirk with Allaah. And the last of the two is what is most evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They have four of their graves located in the masjid from where their Da’wah emerged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The founder of this Jamaa’ah believed in Kashf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a grave worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The Tablighis perform their worship with an innovated form of dhikr, done in the way of the Sufis. This is by splitting up the statement of Tawhheed (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Whoever cuts off the negation part of the Statement of Tawheed from its affirmation part intentionally, by saying &#8220;Laa Ilaaha&#8221; (only), then this necessitates the fact that he has committed disbelief. Shaikh Hamood At-Tuwayjiree stated this, quoting it from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They make it permissible to wear amulets that have on them mystical writings and names of unknown people, which probably are names of devils! And this is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Haqeeqat-ut-Tasawwuf (pg. 11-15) [1422 1st Edition]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words Tasawwuf and Soofiyyah were not known during the first generation of Islaam. Rather, they were only introduced into it after that or they were adopted into Islaam from other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in <i>Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa</i>: “As for the term Soofiyyah (Sufism), then it was not heard of during the first three generations of Islaam. Rather, speech concerning it only became known after the first three generations. Several Imaams and scholars spoke about it afterward, such as Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Abu Sulaymaan Ad-Daaraanee and others. It was also reported from Sufyaan Ath-Thawree that he spoke about it. Some of them also mentioned that on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree. They differed in their views on the meaning of what a Soofee ascribes himself to, since the word ‘Soofee’ is a noun indicating an ascription, such as Al-Qurshee, Al-Madanee and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said to be an ascription to Ahlus-Suffah,[1] but this is an error, since if this were the case, they would call themselves <i>Suffee</i>. It is also said to be an ascription to the <i>saff </i>(row) that is the foremost before Allaah, but this is also wrong, since if this were the case, they would call themselves <i>Saffee</i>. It is also said to be an ascription to the <i>safwah </i>(best) from Allaah’s creation. This too is an error, since if it were so, they would have to call themselves <i>Safwee</i>. It is also held to be an ascription to Soofah bin Bishr bin Udd bin Taabikhah, an Arab tribe that used to be located next to Makkah in the past, which the ascetics would ascribe themselves to. Even though the ascription of Soofee is in conformity to this person’s name (Soofah) from a grammatical standpoint, it is also a weak opinion, since these people were not well known to most of the ascetics and because if the ascetics were to ascribe to them, it would have been more likely that they would have ascribed to them during the era of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and the Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also due to the fact that the majority of those who speak on behalf of the Soofees are not aware of this tribe and they are not pleased with being attributed to a tribe from the Days of Ignorance (<i>Jaahiliyyah</i>), which did not exist during the era of Islaam. It is also held, and this is the most well known opinion, that Soofee is an ascription to <i>soof</i> (wool). This was since the first time that the Soofees appeared was in Basrah (‘Iraq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first people that established the role of Soofiyyah were some of the companions of ‘Abdul-Waahid bin Zayd. ‘Abdul-Waahid was one of the companions of Al-Hasan Al-Basree who lived in Basrah and was into such great lengths in abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>), worship (<i>‘ibaadah</i>), fear of Allaah (<i>khawf</i>) and so on, the likes of which were not found in the rest of the inhabitants of other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abush-Shaikh Al-Asbahaanee reported with a chain of narration connected to Muhammad bin Sireen that it reached him that a group of people preferred wearing wool, so he said: <b>‘There are some people that prefer to wear wool claiming that they resemble the Messiah, son of Maryam. However, the guidance of our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) is more beloved to us, and he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would wear cotton and other types of clothes.’</b> Or he stated words similar to this.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (Ibn Taimiyyah) said after this: “These people ascribe themselves to outer garments, which in this case is wool (soof) garments. So it can be said about one of them that he is a Soofee. However, their methodology is not restricted to the wearing of woolen garments, nor do they mandate that on anyone or adhere to ordering it. They only attach themselves to it due to it being the outer condition.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: “So this is the origin of Soofiyyah (Sufism). After this, it branched off and diversified.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyahs words, may Allaah have mercy on him, indicate that Sufism originated in the lands of Islaam at the hands of some very pious worshippers from Basrah as a result of their going to great lengths in abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>) and worship (<i>‘ibaadah</i>). Then after that, Sufism evolved and changed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conclusion that some modern-day authors have come to – that Sufism crept into the lands of the Muslims from other religions, such as Hinduism and Christian monasticism – has become accepted based on what Shaikh Ibn Taimiyyah reported from Muhammad bin Sireen, that he said: “There are some people that prefer to wear wool claiming that they resemble the Messiah, son of Maryam. However, the guidance of our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) is more beloved to us!” This indicates that Sufism has a connection to the religion of the Christians!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Saabir At-Tu’aimah said in his book: “Sufism – Its Beliefs and Methods”: “It appears that it came about due to the influence of Christian monasticism in which the monks would wear woolen garments and reside in their monasteries. There were many of them that would be upon this practice throughout the lands, which Islaam freed by way of Tawheed…” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ihsaan Ilaahee Dhaheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book “Sufism: Its Source and Origin”: “When we look deep into the teachings of the first and latter-day Sufis and the statements that have been quoted and narrated from them in the Sufi books of old and present, we see a huge difference between it and the teachings of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. Likewise, we don’t see its roots or its seeds in the history of the chief of all creations (Prophet Muhammad) (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) nor in that of his righteous and noble Companions, from the best of Allaah’s creation. Rather, contrary to that, we see that it has been derived and acquired from Christian Monasticism, Brahmanism, Hinduism, the religious devotion of Judaism and the asceticism of Buddhism.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Wakeel, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in the introduction of the book “The Downfall of Sufism”: “Indeed, Sufism is the lowest and vilest of schemes, which the Devil innovated so that the servants of Allaah can mock and ridicule along with him in his war against Allaah and His Messengers. It is the veil of the Magians (Majoos), which gives the impression that it is divine. Rather, it is the veil of every enemy to the true religion. Examine it and you will find in it Brahmanism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and the Manichaean beliefs. You will find Platonism in it. You can even find Judaism, Christianity and the idolatry of the Days of Ignorance in it.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through presenting the views of these modern-day writers regarding the origin of Sufism, as well as many other writers not mentioned here that hold these same views, it becomes clear that Sufism is a foreign concept that was introduced into Islaam. This shows in the practices of those who ascribe themselves to it – those practices that are foreign to Islaam and far removed from its guidance. By this, we intend the latter-day adherents to Sufism whose mystical illusions and fantasies have become many and great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the former predecessors, such as Al-Fudayl bin ‘Iyyaad, Al-Junaid, Ibraaheem bin Adham and others, then they were upon a state of moderateness.<br>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
Al-‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah – Sharh wa Ta’leeq (pg. 39-40)<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed his ummah in many ahaadeeth, advising and cautioning them, that there would be many imposters (Dajjaaleen) after him. In some narrations, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Everyone will claim to be a prophet, whereas I am the seal of the prophets – there being no prophet after me.”</b> [Reported by Muslim and others; See <i>al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i>: no. 1683]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst these imposters was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani who claimed prophethood for himself. He has followers spread throughout India, Germany, England and America. And they have masaajid which they use to misguide the Muslims. There were some individuals amongst them in Syria as well, but Allaah uprooted them and eradicated them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many vile beliefs apart from their belief that prophethood continued after Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). The one who preceded them in this belief is Ibn ‘Arabee, the Sufi. They have authored a treatise on this subject in which they have collected statements from him that serve as support for this afore-mentioned belief of theirs. And the mashaayikh were not able to refute it because it was from that which Ibn ‘Arabee said (!!) even though they asserted with certainty that they were disbelievers. There is no room to mention their beliefs here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt they are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah intended when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said in the hadeeth that has been authentically reported from him: <b>“There will be lying impostors during the Last Days that will bring you narrations, which neither you nor your forefathers heard of. So beware and let them beware, lest they misguide you and bring calamity upon you.”</b> [Reported by the author (i.e. At-Tahaawee) in <i>Mushkil-ul-Athaar</i> (4/104). It is also found in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/9)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From their most distinguishing signs is that when they begin speaking about their Call (i.e. beliefs), before everything, they start out with affirming the death of ‘Eesaa (Jesus). When they are able to accomplish this – according to their perception – they proceed onto the next level, which involves mentioning the ahaadeeth that talk about the descent of ‘Eesaa, and make it clear that that they believe in these narrations. However, they then quickly move on to distorting their meanings by claiming that what is meant by them is the descent of someone similar to ‘Eesaa (Jesus), since they have already established and confirmed – according to their views – that ‘Eesaa (Jesus) died. So they claim that this person was Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many, many other examples of distorting texts similar to this, which leads us to believe that they are a group from amongst the heretical Baatinees. We will point out some of their deviant beliefs soon by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the misguided beliefs of the Qadiyanis is that they reject the Jinn as being a creation apart from mankind. So they distort the apparent meaning of all the ayaat and ahaadeeth that clearly prove their existence and their distinction from mankind amongst creation, instead claiming that these texts refer to humans themselves or a specific group from amongst mankind. This is even the case with Iblees (i.e. the Devil) himself as they allege that he was a human being that was evil! So how misguided they are!!</p>

<p>&#8211; Other Fatwas &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Al-Qadianiyyah order</b></p>
<p><b>The third question of Fatwa no.</b><b> 1615</b></p>
<p>Q 3: What is the ruling on this new faith and its followers, I mean Al-Ahmadiyyah faith? Callers to this faith warn against memorizing any Ayahs from the Qur’an or the Names of Allah and prohibit invoking blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him). Where and when did this faith originate? What is the ruling on those who avoid it?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The<span id="ContentParagraph"> Pakistani </span>government, the Muslim World League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah </span>and the Organization of Islamic Conference held in the League in 1394 A.H. issued a declaration that this (Qadiani) sect is outside the fold of Islam. The Conference published a report on the origin of this sect, when and how it was founded, and many other details disclosing its reality.</p>
<p><span id="ContentParagraph"><b>In conclusion, </b>it is a sect claiming that the Indian leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (born in the thirteenth century) was a prophet who received revelation and that anyone who disbelieves in him is not considered a true Muslim. Allah (Exalted be He) states in His Book that our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Seal (Last) of the Prophets.<a title="Click here"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/margntip.gif" alt="" border="0"></a> Muslim scholars are unanimously agreed upon this. Whosoever claims that after him there is a prophet receiving revelationfrom Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) commits an act of Kufr (disbelief). This is because such a person goes against the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Islamic Ummah (nation) and denies what is stated in the Qur’an and the authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) which affirm that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Last of all prophets.</span></p>

<p>Q: I hope you can explain the ruling on the Sufi order called Al-Qadyaniyyah and their alleged prophet Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany I ask you kindly to send me any books related to this order as I am very interested in studying it.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace be upon him), and there is no prophet after him. This is authentically proved by the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and whoever claims otherwise, or claims Prophethood, then he is a <strong>liar</strong>. Foremost among those people is<span id="ContentParagraph"> Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany </span>whose claim of Prophethood is nothing but falsehood, and so what his followers claim in this regard is also falsehood.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council of Senior Scholars issued a decree regarding<strong><span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Qadyaniyyah </span>as a Kafir (disbelieving) sect</strong> for their claims.</p>

<p><b></b><b>Q 3: </b>What is the difference between the Muslims and Al-Ahmadiyyin ?</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a particular group in Pakistan called the ((Braylwiyyah)) or ((Jamaa&#8217;ah Nuwaaree)) which is a reference to their current leader known as ((Nuwaaree)). I ask your excellencies the Sharee&#8217;ah ruling regarding them and their &#8216;aqeedah, and the prayer behind them as this is a contentious issue which many people are unaware of the reality. I will mention some of their defective ways and beliefs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is alive;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) The belief that the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is present and all-seeing, especially immediately after Salaat al-Jumu&#8217;ah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The belief that the Messenger (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) is the foremost intercessor;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) They believe in &#8220;saints&#8221; and the dead in their graves, and they offer salaah at the graves requesting them for their needs to be met;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) Their commendation of domes and lighting up of graves;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) Their saying ((Yaa Rasool, Yaa Muhammad (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam)));</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7) Their hatred towards whoever loudly says ((Aameen)) and raises his hands in the salaah, considering such a person to be a Wahhaabee;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8) Their great astonishment at the use of the miswaak before the salaah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9) Kissing the thumbs whilst doing wudhoo., the adhaan and after the salaah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10) After the salaah, their imaam repeating the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Allaah sends His prayers on the Prophet and also His angels too}, [Soorah al-Ahzaab, Aayah 56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11) They gather after the Salaat al-Jumu&#8217;ah standing and reciting anaasheed and sending praises (to the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam));</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12) After they complete the Noble Qur.aan in the Salaat at-Taraaweeh in the month of Ramadhaan, they prepare alot of food and distribute it in the dining area of the masjid, in addition to sweets;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13) They build masaajid and seek much importance in decorating them, writing ((Yaa Muhammad)) above the mihraab (standing place of the imaam);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14) They consider themselves the people of the Sunnah and correct &#8216;aqeedah and that (all) others are in error;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15) What is the Sharee&#8217;ah ruling regarding performing the salaah behind them (their imaam), considering I am a medical student in Karachi and live next door to the masjid where they are in (overall) control (i.e. their beliefs and practices prevail)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these characteristics and attributes, then it is not permissible to offer your salaah behind them (their imaam), and whoever knows of their condition, then their salaah is not correct. This is because most of their characteristics and attributes are of kufr and bid`ah which negate the tawheed (oneness) with which Allaah had sent His messenger and revealed in His Book, and that which conflicts with the Qur.aan, such as His (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Verily, you (Muhammad) will die and verily, they (too) will die}, [Soorah az-Zumar, Aayah 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And the mosques are for Allaah (alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah}, [Soorah al-Jinn, Aayah 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And their bid`ah which they practice should be detested with good manners, and if they accept (and leave these pratices) then all praise is for Allaah (alone); And if they do not accept (and continue in these practices) then you should leave them and offer your salaah in the masjid of the Ahlus-Sunnah. And in this, with respect to Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) there is a good example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{And I shall turn away from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allaah. And I shall call on my Lord; and I hope that I shall not be unblest in my invocation to my Lord}, [Soorah Maryam, Aayah 48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Al-Ajwibat-ul-Mufeedah &#8216;an As&#8217;ilat-il-Manaahij-il-Jadeedah</i> (pg. 33-37) [2nd Edition]<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone might say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Why do you talk about the <em><a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/index.htm">Mu’atazliah</a></em>, the <em><a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/index.htm">Jahmiyyah</a></em>, the <em>Zanaadiqah</em>, the <a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/ashariyyah/index.htm">Ash<em>’</em>arees</a>, the <em><a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/index.htm">Khawaarij</a> </em>and the <em>Murji’ah</em> and always mention them when speaking about the issues of Creed, when these groups have ceased to exist and its adherents have died out?” As the saying goes: “They have been consumed by time.” So there is no reason to mention them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our response is, and with Allaah lies the success: Yes, these sects existed in the past, and their followers and founders have died out ages ago. However, their ideologies still prevail, and their beliefs have not come to an end. Rather, the followers of these ideas and beliefs, who have been influenced by these groups, are still present among us today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their ideologies and beliefs are passed on from generation to generation, and they have people who continue to pass them on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the beliefs of the <em>Mu’tazliah</em>, then it is still in existence today and in fact it is widely spread amongst those who ascribe to Islaam. This is since the <a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/shia-raafidah/index.htm"><em>Shee’ah</em></a>, in all of their various sects and denominations, even the Zaydees among them, adhere to the beliefs of the Mu’tazliah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ash’arees, then it is a sect that exists in groups amongst a majority of the Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the belief of <i>Irjaa,</i> it can be found also in the Hanafees who believe that Eemaan (Faith) is just tasdeeq (affirmation) and <i>qawl</i> (speech). So actions, according to them, do not fall into the fold of Eemaan. Even though this <i>Irjaa</i> is of a lesser nature, it is still from the <i>Irjaa</i> of the well-known people of rhetoric.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the apostates, such as those who believe in <i>wahdat-ul-wujood</i> and other than them, then they exist today as well, since the followers of Ibn ‘Arabee can be found today and they are from the extreme <a href="../../innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/index.htm">Sufis</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, when we mention these groups, we are not talking about the actual groups of old, but rather we are talking about the groups that exist among the Muslims today. And this is something that is not hidden from the students of knowledge. So it is only those who are unaware of the realities or those who wish to confuse the people and spread false beliefs that condemn us when we mention these groups. So it is upon such people to ask before they condemn. This is just a short discussion on the matter, but in reality this topic is vast, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will present some examples below that make it clear that the ideologies of these destructive groups are still present today:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Sayyid Qutb said in his book “In the Shade of the Qur’aan” (4/2328): “The Qur’aan is present and in existence just like the earth and the heavens.” This is the <a href="../../quran/index.htm">belief that the Qur’aan is created</a>, and this is the view of the Jahmiyyah and other deviant groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He also said in the afore-mentioned book (6/4002) while interpreting Allaah’s statement: <b>“Say: He is Allaah, the One”</b> [Surah Al-Ikhlaas: 1]: “This indeed refers to the oneness of existence. So there is no reality except for His reality, nor is there a true existence except for His existence. So everything else that exists, its existence stems from that actual existence.” This is the belief of <i><a href="../../2011/10/18/the-ascendancy-of-allaah-a-refutation-of-wahdatul-wujood-hulool-shaykh-albaanee/index.htm">wahdat-ul-wujood</a></i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muhammad Qutb said: “The matter requires us to call the people to Islaam all over again, not because, this time, they reject saying <i><b>‘Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah’ </b></i>with their mouths, as the people during the first stage of strangeness would do, but because the people during this time reject the main requisite of <i><b>Laa Ilaaha Ilaa Allaah</b></i>, which is: Judging by the Legislation of Allaah.” [Quoted from the book “Our Current Situation” (pg. 29)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: This is declaring the masses to be disbelievers, in the absolute sense. If this is not so, then how can he judge that the people reject Allaah’s Rule. And how can he liken them to the Days of Ignorance prior to Islaam, without going into detail or making exceptions for those who do in fact implement Allaah’s Legislation, and who have no constitution except the Book of Allaah? These kinds of general statements are oft repeated by these writers, as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of the huge Salafee Islamic state located in the heart of Arabia. And it is as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of Muslims in various other regions that are from the followers of Hadeeth, supporters of the Sunnah and adherents to the beliefs of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that these people, or some of them, were living in this Islamic state (The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) at the time they made such statements, which contain grave deception for the readers, such that an average person is led to believe that there cannot be found an Islamic state today that professes <i>Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah</i>, implementing its requisites and ruling by Allaah’s Laws. And it leads the reader to believe that there cannot be found any individuals or groups that adhere to Tawheed on the face of this earth. And this is deceiving, misleading and deluding the readers. So let the student of knowledge take note of this phenomenon that is widespread amongst these types of writers, may Allaah guide them to what is correct!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. One of those who ascribes himself to the Da’wah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“From the outward display of sins is when a person boasts about his sins in front of his colleagues. So he begins to speak aloud, saying he did such and such, and he goes into detail about many of his sins. This kind of person will not be forgiven (!!), unless he repents, because the Prophet ruled concerning him that he will not be pardoned: <b>‘Everyone from my ummah will be pardoned except for those who outwardly profess their evil.’</b> And what is worse and viler than this is when some of them say: ‘I have unlawful relations’ or ‘I have girlfriends’ or ‘I go on dates.’ This person is filled with sins. Some of these people even record sins on tapes! There is no honor for these people since they are apostates by doing this!! They record how to beguile a girl and get her to commit lewd acts. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This is apostasy from Islaam!</span> This person (who records this) will be in the Fire of Hell forever unless he repents!!”</b> [From the tape “A Gathering on the Platform]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regard to some of the singers, whose tapes are spread around by the youth – tapes which call to filthiness and which delude the young boys and girls, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“I am certain that the person who does this act, the least that can be said about him, is that he takes sins lightly. And there is no doubt that belittling a sin, especially if it is a major sin and the scholars have unanimously agreed on its prohibition, constitutes disbelief in Allaah. So the likes of these people, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no doubt that their actions are apostasy from Islaam</span>. I say this with a tranquil and calm heart.”</span> <b>[The tape: “The Youth – Questions and Problems]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I say:</strong> Declaring sinners to be disbelievers and interpreting the spread and distribution of sins amongst the people as being a belittlement of sins that leads to disbelief, this shows hastiness in labeling people disbelievers due to major sins and a lack of showing restraint</span>. And this is from the methodology of the Khawaarij, as they declare people to be disbelievers due to major sins. As for the example he gave of a person manifesting his sins and evil relationships with sinners, then this kind of talk shows that these things are probable but do not consist of clear proof. Perhaps the thing that causes the person to do this is ignorance. This is why we must remind them and not declare them disbelievers. And this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Furthermore, belittling something and taking it lightly does not constitute a mockery of it. In fact, everyone that commits a sin, whether major or minor, doesn’t do so unless he first considers it trivial and belittles it. So someone who takes something lightly doesn’t necessarily ridicule it. And who is the one that is free from sins?! And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another person said, whilst asking a question and then responding to it at the same time: <span style="color:#999999;">“Do you think that the evils that are present in our communities today are just sinful matters? Many people assume today that interest is just a sin or a major sin, and that drugs and alcohol are sins, and that bribery is just a sin or one of the major sins… No doubt O brothers!! I have looked into this matter and it has become clear to me now that: Many people in our societies have made interest lawful, and refuge is sought in Allaah. Did you know that now the interest-based banks in our country has reached two million customers? I swear this to you by Allaah! Does each individual from these millions know that interest is Haraam, but yet still deals with it even though it is a sin?! By Allaah!! So then, from the danger that is present today, due to the vast amount of widespread sins is that many people have made these major sins permissible and lawful, and we seek Allaah’s refuge!</span> <b>[From the tape Tawheed First (!!)]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reply with the same answer I gave in the previous example. However, this example is more dangerous for the one who made this statement, in my understanding, since in his grave exaggeration, he claims that what occurs in this society from interest, alcohol and bribery, all of these are not just disobedience or major sins. And he swears by Allaah to this! Being determined that the one who commits sins is deeming it to be permissible, without hearing from anyone of them that they clearly assert interest to be lawful, or dealing with bribes to be lawful or using drugs and alcohol to be lawful – to positively deem these people to be disbelievers without hearing these statements come from them or having a reliable proof that bears witness that they in fact deem these acts to be permissible, and to instead only have assumptions, is a clear proof of the weak restraint and lack of consideration this individual has. This is the methodology of the Khawaarij and the Mu’tazliah. So my advice to him and those like him is to recant from making such general assertions that are more dangerous for them than for others. Turning back to the truth is better than persisting in falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. A third person, who has a doctorate in ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, said whilst holding in his hand a flyer from a hotel in one of the Gulf states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“In this hotel, it clearly states, that they serve alcoholic drinks, in addition to the other things it has…So this is a clear call to alcohol and to naked and intermingled dancing whilst drinking alcohol. We seek Allaah’s refuge from this disbelief.”</span> <b>[From Cassette No. 272/2 of The Explanation of al-‘Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah] </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said in a book of his:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Disbelief and apostasy has appeared in our newspapers, evil has spread in our circles and we are called to fornication on our radios and television sets. And we have made interest lawful.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was prepared and printed with various different titles. In Pakistan, it went by the title: “Removing the Grief from the Scholars of the Ummah.” In America, it goes by the title: “Kissinger’s Promise.” And in Egypt, the book was titled: “Facts surrounding the Gulf Crisis.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, you have seen how this individual has taken it upon himself to make the statement that we have made interest permissible. But we, all praise be to Allaah, do not deem interest as being permissible, nor does our society. Nor do we consider simply distributing alcoholic drinks to some of the neighboring regions as being open disbelief that expels one from the fold of Islaam. Rather, that which we worship Allaah with, is that those things mentioned by these individuals that ascribe themselves to the Da’wah – all of these things are sins, apart from disbelief. In fact all of these acts are a lesser form of disbelief (i.e. minor disbelief), meaning that they are acts of disobedience and major sins that negate the completeness of Eemaan of the person who commits them, but not the foundation of Eemaan, as the Prophet said: <b>“A fornicator does not fornicate whilst being a believer at the time he fornicates. And a thief does not steal whilst being a believer at the time he is stealing…” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt the Eemaan (Faith) that is being negated here is the completeness of Eemaan (i.e. so the sinner does not have complete Eemaan, meaning his Eemaan is deficient). And there are many more examples of this in our Religion. We ask Allaah to grant us understanding of our Religion and to guide these people and their likes to the truth. My dear brother, O you who strives for this Salafee methodology! After seeing these examples of the ideologies present in some of the callers today, not to mention the youth that are deceived by them, and who sit in front of them, taking their ideas and beliefs, which destroy the Creed of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeing all this, will you still say: “Why do you talk about these groups that have come to an end”, when their deviant and corrupt beliefs and methods still exist and their misguidance is still present?? So reflect, may Allaah guide you, on the importance of Tawheed and of implementing it, and on warning about all of the deviant groups in every time and place, and on returning back to the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih (righteous predecessors), in light of the Book and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>
