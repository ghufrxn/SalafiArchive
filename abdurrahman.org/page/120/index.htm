<h3 align="center">Prophetic Commentary on the Qur&#8217;an(Tafseer of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam))</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.060.001"></a>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said bin Al-Mu&#8217;alla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called me but I did not respond to him. Later I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say&#8217;&#8211;&#8220;Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you.&#8221; (8.24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said to me, &#8220;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Qur&#8217;an, before you leave the Mosque.&#8221; Then he got hold of my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say to me, &#8216;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Quran?&#8217; He said, &#8220;Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab&#8217;a Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur&#8217;an which has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Imam says: &#8216;Ghair-il-Maghdubi &#8216;Alaihim Walad-Dallin (i.e. not the path of those who earn Your Anger, nor the path of those who went astray (1.7)), then you must say, &#8216;Ameen&#8217;, for if one&#8217;s utterance of &#8216;Ameen&#8217; coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &#8216;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&#8217; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &#8216;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&#8217; They will go to him and Noah will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &#8216;Go to the Khalil&#8211;r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&#8217; They will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&#8217; So they will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&#8217;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&#8217;s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.&#8217; (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, &#8216;None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.&#8217; &#8221; (The compiler) Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;But those whom the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned in Hell,&#8217; refers to the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will dwell therein forever.&#8221; (16.29)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the greatest sin in the Sight of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That you set up a rival unto Allah though He Alone created you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is indeed a great sin.&#8221; Then asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Kam&#8217;a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;It was said to the children of Israel, &#8216;Enter the gate (of the town), prostrate (in humility) and say: Hittatun (i.e. repentance) i.e. O Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgive our sins.&#8217; But they entered by dragging themselves on their buttocks, so they did something different (from what they had been ordered to do) and said, &#8216;Hittatun,&#8217; but added, &#8220;A grain in a hair.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8220;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Gabriel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission.&#8221; (2.97) Then he added, &#8220;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&#8221; On hearing that, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&#8221; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &#8220;What is &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s status amongst you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;May Allah protect him from this!&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah came out and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The Jews then said, &#8220;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&#8221; and disparaged him. On that &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;Our best Qur&#8217;an reciter is Ubai and our best judge is &#8216;Ali; and in spite of this, we leave some of the statements of Ubai because Ubai says, &#8216;I do not leave anything that I have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle while Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whatever verse (Revelations) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We bring a better one or similar to it.&#8221; (2.106)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is that he claims that I cannot recreate him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me, it is his statement that I have offspring. No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;I agreed with Allah in three things,&#8221; or said, &#8220;My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.&#8217; I also said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.&#8217; So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, &#8216;You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.&#8217; When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle haven&#8217;t what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?&#8217; &#8221; Thereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..&#8221; (66.5)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that when your people built the Ka&#8217;ba, they did not build it on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Aisha had surely heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka&#8217;ba was not built on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say:&#8211; &#8220;We believe in Allah and what is revealed to us.&#8221; (2.136)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). (So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &#8216;Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &#8220;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.&#8221; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&#8217;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8220;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.&#8221; (2.143)</p>

So they (i.e. Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message. And the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah &#8220;Thus We have made of you a just and the best nation that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, and I was at that time a young boy, &#8220;How do you interpret the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj to the House of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.

When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, whereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158)</p>

The law of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in cases of murder: The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the relatives (or one of them) of the killed (person) forgive their brother (i.e. the killers something of Qisas (i.e. not to kill the killer by accepting blood money in the case of intentional murder)&#8212;-then the relatives (of the killed person) should demand blood-money in a reasonable manner and the killer must pay with handsome gratitude. This is an allevitation and a Mercy from your Lord, (in comparison to what was prescribed for the nations before you).</p>

Then they went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and refused everything except Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed the judgment of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality of punishment). Anas bin Al-Nadr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will the incisor tooth of Ar-Rubai be broken? No, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, her incisor tooth will not be broken.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Anas! The prescribed law of Allah is equality in punishment (i.e. Al-Qisas.)&#8221; Thereupon those people became satisfied and forgave her.

Islam is founded on five principles, i.e. believe in Allah and His Apostle, the five compulsory prayers, the fasting of the month of Ramadan, the payment of Zakat, and the Hajj to the House (of Allah).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! Won&#8217;t you listen to why Allah has mentioned in His Book: &#8216;If two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them, but if one of then transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then you all fight against the one that transgresses. (49.9) and:&#8211;&#8220;And fight them till there is no more affliction (i.e. no more worshiping of others along with Allah).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did it, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when Islam had only a few followers. A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is your opinion about &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Uthman, it seems that Allah has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven. And as for &#8216;Ali, he is the cousin of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his son-in-law.&#8221; Then he pointed with his hand and said, &#8220;That is his house which you see.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people and those who embraced their religion, used to stay at Muzdalifa and used to call themselves Al-Hums, while the rest of the Arabs used to stay at &#8216;Arafat. When Islam came, Allah ordered His Prophet to go to &#8216;Arafat and stay at it, and then pass on from there, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah:&#8211;&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (2.199)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to &#8216;Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of &#8216;Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of &#8216;Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to &#8216;Arafat and stay there from the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from &#8216;Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam&#8217; (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say, &#8220;O Allah! Our Lord! Give us in this world that, which is good and in the Hereafter that, which is good and save us from the torment of the Fire.&#8221; (2.201)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most hated man in the Sight of Allah is the one who is the most quarrelsome.&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The Prophet said, &#8220;Or do you think that you shall enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you?&#8221; (2.214)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8220;(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help &#8230;.&#8221; (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound &#8216;dh&#8217;, and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: &#8220;..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Allah&#8217;s Help? Yes, verily, Allah&#8217;s Help is near.&#8221; (2.214)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I met &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;Aisha said, &#8216;Allah forbid! By Allah, Allah never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars.&#8221; reading &#8216;Kudh-dhibu with double &#8216;dh.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Ibn &#8216;Umar recited the Qur&#8217;an, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur&#8217;an and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, &#8220;Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed? &#8221; I replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was revealed in such-and-such connection.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then resumed his recitation. Nafi added regarding the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;So go to your tilth when or how you will&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It means one should approach his wife in ..&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews used to say: &#8220;If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child.&#8221; So this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Your wives are a tilth unto you; so go to your tilth when or how you will.&#8221; (2.223)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister of Ma&#8217;qal bin Yasar was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of &#8216;Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal refused, so this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.&#8221; (2.232)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 53:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan (while he was collecting the Qur&#8217;an) regarding the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives &#8230;&#8221; (2.240) &#8220;This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur&#8217;an)?&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said. &#8220;O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 54:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse):&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They &#8211; (their wives) &#8212; shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).&#8221; (2.234)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband&#8217;s family, so Allah revealed: &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year&#8217;s maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.&#8217; (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband&#8217;s home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.&#8221; So the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata said: Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: &#8220;..without turning them out..&#8221; cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband&#8217;s house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217;s aid: If she wished, she could complete her &#8216;Idda by staying in her dead husband&#8217;s residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband&#8217;s house), so she could complete the &#8216;Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow&#8217;s) dwelling in her dead husband&#8217;s house and she could complete the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah&#8217;s Statement says:&#8211;&#8220;&#8230;without turning them out&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Utba regarding the question of Subai&#8217;a bint Al-Harith. Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;But &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s uncle used not to say so.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,&#8221; and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin &#8216;Amir or Malik bin &#8216;Auf, and said, &#8220;What was the verdict of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8216;Why do you impose on her the hard order and don&#8217;t let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara).&#8221; (i.e. Her &#8216;Idda is up till she delivers.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, &#8220;The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one Rak&#8217;a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak&#8217;a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a Rak&#8217;a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second Rak&#8217;a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not.&#8221; Nafi added: I do not think that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar narrated this except from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly &#8220;The Fear Prayer.&#8221;)</p>

While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, &#8216;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &#8216;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &#8216;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&#8217;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&#8217; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &#8216;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) family status amongst you? I said, &#8216;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&#8221; Heraclius said, &#8216;Was any of his ancestors a king?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&#8217; I said, &#8216;It is the poor who followed him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you fight with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;How was your fighting with him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did he ever betray?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &#8216;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &#8216;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&#8221; Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Heraclius then asked me, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&#8217; Then Heraclius said, &#8216;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&#8217; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine&#8230;&#8230;.. Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah&#8217;s Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah&#8217;s Statement):&#8211;&#8220;O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Allah&#8230;.bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8217; (3.64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;While coming out, I said to my companions, &#8216;The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.&#8217; So I continued to believe that Allah&#8217;s Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace Islam.&#8221; Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, &#8216;O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?&#8217; (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, &#8216;Bring them back to me.&#8217; So he called them and said, &#8216;I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.&#8217; Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Out of all the Ansar, living in Medina, Abu Talha had the largest number of (date palm trees) gardens, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was standing opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good water. When the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Allah says:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Allah&#8217;s Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Allah. So, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Allah orders you (to dispose it of).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives.&#8221; The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from among them who had committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We blacken their faces with coal and beat them,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We do not find anything in it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. &#8220;You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful.&#8221; (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar-Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher&#8217;s) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, &#8220;This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 89:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, &#8220;O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, &#8220;Did you not hear what &#8216;Abu Hub-b said?&#8221; He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai. &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; On that Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Allah said: &#8220;And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans&#8230;&#8230;..'(3.186) And Allah also said:&#8211;&#8220;Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..&#8221; (2.109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).&#8221; So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, some men among the hypocrites used to remain behind him (i.e. did not accompany him) when he went out for a Ghazwa and they would be pleased to stay at home behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned (from the battle) they would put forward (false) excuses and take oaths, wishing to be praised for what they had not done. So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>

It was only that the Prophet called the Jews and asked them about something, and they hid the truth and told him something else, and showed him that they deserved praise for the favor of telling him the answer to his question, and they became happy with what they had concealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Abbas recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;(And remember) when Allah took a Covenant from those who were given the Scripture..and those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done.&#8217; &#8221; (3.187-188)</p>

Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Allah, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added,&#8221; The people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They ask your instruction regarding women &#8221; (4.127) &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And yet whom you desire to marry.&#8221; (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And whoever amongst the guardian is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his work). This Verse was revealed regarding the orphan&#8217;s property. If the guardian is poor, he can take from the property of the orphan, what is just and reasonable according to his work and the time he spends on managing it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and Abu Bakr came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama&#8217;s (dwellings). The Prophet found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?&#8221; So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah commands you as regards your children&#8217;s (inheritance):&#8221; (4.11)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Pre-Islamic Period ) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Allah cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Divine Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them.&#8221; (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Verse: &#8220;To everyone, We have appointed heirs.&#8221; (4.33) &#8216;Mawali&#8217; means heirs. And regarding:&#8211; &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter&#8217;s relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;To everyone We have appointed heirs.&#8221; was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn Abbas then said: &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221; is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, &#8220;Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.&#8221; Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.&#8217; They will be directed and addressed thus, &#8216;Will you drink,&#8217; whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, &#8216;What are you waiting for?&#8217; Every nation have followed what they used to worship.&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say twice or thrice, &#8216;We do not worship any besides Allah.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Irrigate (your lands and the let the water flow to your neighbor The Ansar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (This is because) he (Zubair) is your cousin?&#8221; At that, the Prophet&#8217;s face became red (with anger) and he said &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor.&#8221; So the Prophet enabled Az-Zubair to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: &#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.6)</p>

Abu Bakr came to me and hit me violently on the chest and said, &#8220;You have detained the people because of a necklace.&#8221; I kept as motionless as a dead person because of the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ; (on my lap) although Abu Bakr had hurt me (with the slap). Then the Prophet woke up and it was the time for the morning (prayer). Water was sought, but in vain; so the following Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When you intend to offer prayer..&#8221; (5.6) Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;Allah has blessed the people for your sake, O the family of Abu Bakr. You are but a blessing for them.&#8221;</p>

So take them out and drink of their milk and urine.&#8217; So they took them and set out and drank of their urine and milk, and having recovered, they attacked the shepherd, killed him and drove away the camels.&#8217; Why should there be any delay in punishing them as they murdered (a person) and waged war against Allah and His Apostle and frightened Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; Anbasa said, &#8220;I testify the uniqueness of Allah!&#8221; Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Do you suspect me?&#8221; &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, Anas narrated that (Hadith) to us.&#8221; Then &#8216;Anbasa added, &#8220;O the people of such-and-such (country), you will remain in good state as long as Allah keeps this (man) and the like of this (man) amongst you.&#8221;</p>

People (in the Pre-lslamic periods of ignorance) used to let that she camel loose for their idols if it gave birth to two she-camels successively without giving birth to a male camel in between. &#8216;Ham&#8217; was the male camel which was used for copulation. When it had finished the number of copulations assigned for it, they would let it loose for their idols and excuse it from burdens so that nothing would be carried on it, and they called it the &#8216;Hami.&#8217; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying so.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was praying, Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed me and called me, but I did not go to him until I had finished the prayer. Then I went to him, and he said, &#8220;What prevented you from coming to me? Didn&#8217;t Allah say:&#8211; &#8220;O you who believe! Answer the call of Allah (by obeying Him) and His Apostle when He calls you?&#8221; He then said, &#8220;I will inform you of the greatest Sura in the Qur&#8217;an before I leave (the mosque).&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle got ready to leave (the mosque), I reminded him. He said, &#8220;It is: &#8216;Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.&#8217; (i.e. Surat-al-Fatiha) As-sab&#8217;a Al-Mathani (the seven repeatedly recited Verses).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And if two groups of believers fight against each other&#8230;&#8217; (49.9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what prevents you from fighting as Allah has mentioned in His Book?&#8221;&#8216; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! I would rather be blamed for not fighting because of this Verse than to be blamed because of another Verse where Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And whoever kills a believer intentionally&#8230;&#8221; (4.93) Then that man said, &#8220;Allah says:&#8211; &#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (worshipping other besides Allah) and the religion (i.e. worship) will be all for Allah (Alone)&#8221; (8.39) Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did this during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the number of Muslims was small, and a man was put to trial because of his religion, the pagans would either kill or chain him; but when the Muslims increased (and Islam spread), there was no persecution.&#8221; When that man saw that Ibn &#8216;Umar did not agree to his proposal, he said, &#8220;What is your opinion regarding &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Uthman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What is my opinion regarding Ali and &#8216;Uthman? As for &#8216;Uthman, Allah forgave him and you disliked to forgive him, and Ali is the cousin and son-in-law of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Then he pointed out with his hand and said, &#8220;And that is his daughter&#8217;s (house) which you can see.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;If there are twenty steadfast amongst you, they will overcome two hundred.&#8221; (8.65) was revealed, then it became obligatory for the Muslims that one (Muslim) should not flee from ten (non-Muslims). Sufyan (the sub-narrator) once said, &#8220;Twenty (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non Muslims).&#8221; Then there was revealed: &#8216;But now Allah has lightened your (task)..&#8217; (8.66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it became obligatory that one-hundred (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non-muslims). (Once Sufyan said extra, &#8220;The Verse: &#8216;Urge the believers to the fight. If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims) ..&#8217; was revealed.) Sufyan said, &#8220;Ibn Shabrama said, &#8220;I see that this order is applicable to the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211;&#8216;If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims), they will overcome two-hundred (non-Muslims).&#8217; was revealed, it became hard on the Muslims when it became compulsory that one Muslim ought not to flee (in war) before ten (non-Muslims). So (Allah) lightened the order by revealing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(But) now Allah has lightened your (task) for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are of you one-hundred steadfast, they will overcome (two-hundred (non-Muslims).&#8217; (8.66) So when Allah reduced the number of enemies which Muslims should withstand, their patience and perseverance against the enemy decreased as much as their task was lightened for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a disagreement between them (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubair) so I went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas in the morning and said (to him), &#8220;Do you want to fight against Ibn Zubair and thus make lawful what Allah has made unlawful (i.e. fighting in Meccas?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah forbid! Allah ordained that Ibn Zubair and Bani Umaiya would permit (fighting in Mecca), but by Allah, I will never regard it as permissible.&#8221; Ibn Abbas added. &#8220;The people asked me to take the oath of allegiance to Ibn AzZubair. I said, &#8216;He is really entitled to assume authority for his father, Az-Zubair was the helper of the Prophet, his (maternal) grandfather, Abu Bakr was (the Prophet&#8217;s) companion in the cave, his mother, Asma&#8217; was &#8216;Dhatun-Nitaq&#8217;, his aunt, &#8216;Aisha was the mother of the Believers, his paternal aunt, Khadija was the wife of the Prophet , and the paternal aunt of the Prophet was his grandmother. He himself is pious and chaste in Islam, well versed in the Knowledge of the Quran. By Allah! (Really, I left my relatives, Bani Umaiya for his sake though) they are my close relatives, and if they should be my rulers, they are equally apt to be so and are descended from a noble family.</p>

So I said, &#8220;I never expected that he would refuse my offer to support him, and I don&#8217;t think he intends to do me any good, therefore, if my cousins should inevitably be my rulers, it will be better for me to be ruled by them than by some others.&#8221;</p>

Do you offer the prayer for Ibn Ubai although he said so-and-so on such-and-such-a day?&#8221; I went on mentioning his sayings. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said, &#8220;Keep away from me, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But when I spoke too much to him, he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice, and I have chosen (this) ; and if I knew that if I asked forgiveness for him more than seventy times, he would be for given, I would ask it for more times than that.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and then left, but he did not stay long before the two Verses of Surat-Bara&#8217;a were revealed, i.e.:&#8211; &#8216;And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies&#8230;. and died in a state of rebellion.&#8217; (9.84) Later I was astonished at my daring to speak like that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah and His Apostle know best.</p>

Those two visitors said to those men, &#8216;Go and dip yourselves in that river.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik talking about the Verse:&#8211; &#8216;And to the three (He also forgave) who remained behind.&#8217; (9.118) saying in the last portion of his talk, &#8220;(I said), &#8216;As a part (sign) of my repentance, I would like to give up all my property in the cause of Allah and His Apostle,&#8217; The Prophet said to me, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth as it is good for you.&#8221; (To the three (He also forgave) who remained behind till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened&#8230;&#8221; (9.118)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 199:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat-al&#8217;Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. &#8220;I decided to tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah&#8217;s Apostle might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third of the night while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;O Um Salama! Ka&#8217;b has been forgiven!&#8217; She said, &#8216;Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.&#8217; So when the Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah said: &#8216;They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions.&#8221; (9.94)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone whom Allah has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Allah revealed to His Apostle: &#8220;Verily! Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).&#8221; (9.117-119) (See Hadith No. 702 Vol 5).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 201:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra&#8217; were killed). &#8216;Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra&#8217; (those who know the Qur&#8217;an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;How can I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not done?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said (to me), &#8216;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&#8217; So &#8216;Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as &#8216;Umar.&#8221; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &#8220;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur&#8217;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &#8221; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&#8217;an. I said to both of them, &#8220;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&#8221; (9.128)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar&#8217;s daughter.</p>

When I went to him, he said, &#8220;What prevented you from coming?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I was praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say&#8221; &#8220;O you who believes Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle.&#8221; (8.24) Then he added, &#8220;Shall I tell you the most superior Sura in the Qur&#8217;an before I go out of the mosque?&#8221; When the Prophet intended to go out (of the Mosque), I reminded him and he said, &#8220;That is: &#8220;Alhamdu-lillahi Rabbil-&#8216;Alamin (Surat-al-fatiha)&#8217; which is the seven oft repeated verses (Al-Mathani) and the Grand Quran which has been given to me.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some (cooked) meat was brought to Allah Apostle and the meat of a forearm was presented to him as he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, &#8220;I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Allah will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people will say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see to what state you have reached? Won&#8217;t you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord&#8217; Some people will say to some others, &#8216;Go to Adam.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say to him. &#8216;You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are? Don&#8217;t you see what condition we have reached?&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.&#8217; So they will go to Noah and say (to him), &#8216;O Noah! You are the first (of Allah&#8217;s Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Allah has named you a thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; He will say.&#8217; Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.&#8217; They will go to Abraham and say, &#8216;O Abraham! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; He will say to them, &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter.

You art Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah gave you superiority above the others with this message and with His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for us with your Lord Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; Moses will say, &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will become thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.&#8217; So they will go to Jesus and say, &#8216;O Jesus! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; Jesus will say. &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, &#8216;Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.&#8217; So they will come to me and say, &#8216;O Muhammad ! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then I will go beneath Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and Say, &#8216;My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord&#8217;. It will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The enemy of Allah (Nauf) told a lie.&#8221; Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Moses got up to deliver a speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah alone. So Allah revealed to him: &#8216;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;O my Lord, how can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.&#8217; So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant &#8216;Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,&#8217; &#8216;Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.&#8217; (18.63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, &#8216;That is what we have been seeking&#8217;. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. &#8216;Is there such a greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.&#8217; (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. &#8216;If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.&#8217; These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.&#8217; (18.71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me ?&#8217; (18.72) Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)&#8221; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.&#8217; Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.&#8217; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, &#8216;If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.&#8217; (18.76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, &#8216;These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217; (18.78-82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their story.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la bin Muslim and &#8216;Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &#8216;Abbas, Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Ask me (any question)&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&#8217;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&#8221; As for &#8216;Amr, he said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&#8221; But Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Once Moses, Allah&#8217;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &#8216;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! Where is he?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;At the junction of the two seas.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Amr said to me, Allah said, &#8220;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&#8221; Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Allah said (to Moses), &#8216;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&#8217; &#8221; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&#8221; He said (to Moses).&#8221; You have not demanded too much.&#8221; And that is as mentioned by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant &#8230;. &#8216; (18.60) Yusha&#8217; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &#8220;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &#8220;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &#8216;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &#8220;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&#8221; Moses said &#8220;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&#8221; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &#8216;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&#8217; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &#8216;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&#8217; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &#8216;The pious slave of Allah.&#8217; (We said to Said &#8220;Was that Khadir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;) The boat men said, &#8216;We will not get him on board with fare.&#8217; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &#8216;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &#8220;Moses said so protestingly.&#8221;) Al-Khadir said, didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&#8217; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&#8217;la- said: Said said &#8216;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&#8217; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &#8216;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&#8217;la said, &#8216;I think Said said, &#8216;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &#8216;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &#8216;Wages that we might had eaten.&#8217; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&#8221; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8216;In front of them (was) a king.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &#8216;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &#8216;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&#8217; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &#8216;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&#8217; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&#8217; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&#8217;? (18.74). &#8216;Near to mercy&#8221; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&#8217;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &#8216;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf-al-Bakali &#8221; claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, &#8216;Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:&#8211; &#8216;Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! How can meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than &#8216;Amr said) &#8216;At the rock there was a water spring called &#8216;Al-Hayat&#8217; and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, &#8216;Bring our early meal&#8217; (18.62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish &#8230;&#8217; (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there any such greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man said, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and added, &#8216;may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?&#8217; (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, &#8216;O Moses! You have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;But I will follow you.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation&#8217;s knowledge compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow&#8217;s beak.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir&#8217;s action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, &#8216;These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have&#8230;&#8217; (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! &#8216; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.&#8217; (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, &#8216;When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217;&#8230;(18.78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their story.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to recite:&#8211; &#8216;And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) &#8230;and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. &#8220;</p>

Eternity for you and no death.&#8221;&#8216; Then the Prophet, recited:&#8211;</p>

Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (i.e. the husband), or what should he do? Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; Asim then went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

A man has found another man with his wife! Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed regarding you and your wife&#8217;s case in the Qur&#8217;an &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula&#8217;ana according to what Allah had mentioned in His Book.

If I kept her I would oppress her.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana.

If she (Uwaimir&#8217;s wife) delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that &#8216;Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will consider that &#8216;Uwaimir has told a lie against her.&#8221; Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned as a proof for &#8216;Uwaimir&#8217;s claim; therefore the child was ascribed to its mother henceforth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him whereupon you might kill him (i.e. the killer) (in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; So Allah revealed concerning their case what is mentioned of the order of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the man, &#8220;The matter between you and your wife has been decided.&#8221; So they did Mula&#8217;ana in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, and then the man divorced his wife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, so the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of his mother, and she would inherit of him what Allah prescribed for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma&#8217; and filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), &#8220;Either you bring forth a proof (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying, &#8220;Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal then said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment.&#8221; Then Gabriel came down and revealed to him:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;As for those who accuse their wives&#8230;&#8217; (24.6-9) The Prophet recited it till he reached: &#8216;&#8230; (her accuser) is telling the truth.&#8217; Then the Prophet left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and brought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet was saying, &#8220;Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?&#8221; Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, &#8220;It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Allah&#8217;s curse on you (if you are guilty).&#8221; So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, &#8220;I will not dishonor my family all through these days,&#8221; and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet then said, &#8220;Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma&#8217;s child.&#8221; Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet said, &#8220;If the case was not settled by Allah&#8217;s Law, I would punish her severely.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man accused his wife of illegal sexual intercourse and denied his paternity to her (conceived) child during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&#8217;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&#8217;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; and then depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined ! &#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8220;O you there! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he has said?&#8221; I said, &#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8221; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8220;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&#8221; But &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: So Allah&#8217;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &#8220;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &#8220;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&#8221; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&#8221; On that, Sad bin &#8216;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &#8220;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&#8221; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8220;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&#8221; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &#8220;Thereafter, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then I said to my mother, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&#8217;s father: &#8220;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &#8220;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&#8221; My mother said to me, &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not&#8230;.&#8221; (24.11-20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter&#8217;s kinship to him and his poverty, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha&#8221;. So Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&#8217;s Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.&#8221; Aisha further said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, &#8220;O Zainab! What have you seen?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&#8221; Of all the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&#8221; Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off&#8221; Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh), &#8220;You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.&#8221; It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, &#8220;Let Mistah. be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;O mother Why do you abuse your Son&#8221; On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Why do you abuse your son?&#8221; She stumbled for the third time and said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not abuse him except because of you.&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Concerning what of my affairs?&#8221; So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, &#8220;Has this really happened?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Send me to my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, &#8220;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&#8221; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&#8221; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &#8220;Does my father know about it?&#8221; She said, &#8220;yes&#8221; I asked, Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle know about it too?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, Allah&#8217;s Apostle does too.&#8221; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &#8220;What is the matter with her? &#8221; She said, &#8220;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&#8221; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&#8221; I went back to my home and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&#8221; On that, some of the Prophet&#8217;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &#8220;Tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.&#8221; Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&#8221; Later that man was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, &#8220;Now then O &#8216;Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&#8221; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&#8217;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&#8221; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &#8220;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &#8216;She has confessed herself guilty.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&#8217;s name but couldn&#8217;t) Joseph&#8217;s father when he said; So (for me) &#8220;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &#8220;Have the good tidings O &#8216; &#8220;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&#8221; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&#8221; (Aisha used to say:) &#8220;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&#8217;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) &#8230;Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.&#8221; So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</p>

O Bani &#8216;Adi!&#8221; addressing various tribes of Quraish till they were assembled. Those who could not come themselves, sent their messengers to see what was there. Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet then said, &#8220;Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) &#8220;May your hands perish all this day.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, a sentence with which I will defend you before Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said to Abu Talib, &#8220;Will you now leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting him to say that sentence while the other two kept on repeating their sentence before him till Abu Talib said as the last thing he said to them, &#8220;I am on the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib,&#8221; and refused to say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Allah, I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans.&#8217; (9.113) And then Allah revealed especially about Abu Talib:&#8211;&#8216;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;">While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, &#8220;Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.&#8221; That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas&#8217;ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, &#8220;He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, &#8216;Allah knows best,&#8217; for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)&#8217; (38.86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.&#8217; So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).&#8217; Then Ibn Mas&#8217;ud recited:&#8211; &#8216;Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;.but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them thus): &#8216;On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah&#8217;s saying- &#8220;Lizama&#8221; (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious,&#8217; (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the defeat of Byzantine has already passed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came to him walking and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. What is Belief?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Belief is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the Resurrection.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Islam?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Islam is to worship Allah and not worship anything besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The man again asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or Benevolence)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take it for granted that) Allah sees you.&#8221; The man further asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle When will the Hour be established?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet replied, &#8220;The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.&#8221; (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, &#8220;Call him back to me.&#8221; They went to call him back but could not see him. The Prophet said, &#8220;That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 47 Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to look down upon those ladies who had given themselves to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I used to say, &#8220;Can a lady give herself (to a man)?&#8221; But when Allah revealed: &#8220;You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive any of them whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily).&#8217; (33.51) I said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives) and you may receive any (of them) whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily). (33.51) I asked Aisha, &#8220;What did you use to say (in this case)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I used to say to him, &#8220;If I could deny you the permission (to go to your other wives) I would not allow your favor to be bestowed on any other person.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he invited the people to a meal. They took the meal and remained sitting and talking. Then the Prophet (showed them) as if he is ready to get up, yet they did not get up. When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet&#8230;&#8217; (33.53)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I of all the people know best this verse of Al-Hijab. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh she was with him in the house and he prepared a meal and invited the people (to it). They sat down (after finishing their meal) and started chatting. So the Prophet went out and then returned several times while they were still sitting and talking. So Allah revealed the Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses until leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation &#8230;..ask them from behind a screen.&#8217; (33.53) So the screen was set up and the people went away.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A banquet of bread and meat was held on the occasion of the marriage of the Prophet to Zainab bint Jahsh. I was sent to invite the people (to the banquet), and so the people started coming (in groups); They would eat and then leave. Another batch would come, eat and leave. So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Carry away the remaining food.&#8221; Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you, O the people of the house!&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you. Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him. Then the Prophet returned and found a group of three persons still in the house chatting. The Prophet was a very shy person, so he went out (for the second time) and went towards the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha. I do not remember whether I informed him that the people have gone away. So he returned and as soon as he entered the gate, he drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he made the people eat meat and bread to their fill (by giving a Walima banquet). Then he went out to the dwelling places of the mothers of the believers (his wives), as he used to do in the morning of his marriage. He would greet them and invoke good on them, and they (too) would return his greeting and invoke good on him. When he returned to his house, he found two men talking to each other; and when he saw them, he went out of his house again. When those two men saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle: going out of his house, they quickly got up (and departed). I do not remember whether I informed him of their departure, or he was informed (by somebody else). So he returned, and when he entered the house, he lowered the curtain between me and him. Then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &#8220;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and &#8216;Umar said to me so-and-so.&#8221; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &#8220;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aflah, the brother of Abi Al-Quais, asked permission to visit me after the order of Al-Hijab was revealed. I said, &#8220;I will not permit him unless I take permission of the Prophet about him for it was not the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais but the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais that nursed me.&#8221; The Prophet entered upon me, and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais had nursed me.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, for he is your uncle. Taribat Yaminuki (may your right hand be saved)&#8221; &#8216;Urwa, the sub-narrator added: For that &#8216;Aisha used to say, &#8220;Consider those things which are illegal because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding foster relations.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Moses was a shy man, and that is what the Statement of Allah means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe Be not like those who annoyed Moses, but Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was honorable in Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8217; (33.69)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &#8220;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&#8221; (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other.&#8221; (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?&#8217; So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&#8221;</p>

Is it for this thing that you have gathered us?&#8221; So Allah revealed:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (decreed). And that is the decree of All-Mighty, the All-Knowing&#8230;.&#8217; (36.38)</p>

Those are they whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.&#8217; (6.90) So David was the one of those prophets whom Prophet (Muhammad) was ordered to follow.

I intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque till the morning so that all of you could see him, but then I remembered the Statement of my brother Solomon:&#8211;&#8216;My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) The narrator added: Then he (the Prophet) dismissed him, rejected. &#8216;Nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud and he said &#8220;O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, &#8220;Allah knows better,&#8217; for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to His Prophet: &#8216;Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Quran) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.&#8221; So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.&#8217; (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) &#8220;Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers.&#8221; How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: &#8216;One taught (by a human being), a madman?&#8217; &#8216;We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The day We shall seize you with a mighty grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8221; (44.16)</p>

Whatever you say and invite people to, is good: but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiration for our (past evil) deeds.&#8221; So the Divine Verses came: &#8216;Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, not kill such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; (25.68) And there was also revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their souls!

Then He will say, &#8216;I am the King.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi.

<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was asked (regarding):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Except to be kind to me for my Kinship with you.&#8217; (42.23) Said bin Zubair (who was present then) said, &#8220;It means here (to show what is due for) the relatives of Muhammad.&#8221; On that Ibn Abbas said: you have hurried in giving the answer! There was no branch of the tribe of Quraish but the Prophet had relatives therein. The Prophet said, &#8220;I do not want anything from (you ) except to be Kind to me for my Kinship with you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet reciting when on the pulpit: &#8216;They will cry, &#8220;O Malik (Keeper of Hell) Let your Lord make an end of us.&#8217; (43.77)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 345:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five things have passed, i.e. the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, Al-Batsha (the defeat of the infidels in the battle of Badr) and Al-Lizam (the punishment)&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 346:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Allah to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of torment.&#8217; (44.10-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they are on the verge of destruction.&#8221; On that the Prophet said (astonishingly) &#8220;Shall I invoke Allah) for the tribes of Mudar? Verily, you are a brave man!&#8221; But the Prophet prayed for rain and it rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;But truly you will return (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.15) (When the famine was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.16) The narrator said, &#8220;That was the day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 347:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of having knowledge that, when you do not know something, you say: &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to his Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist)&#8217; (38.86) When the Quraish troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph.&#8221; So they were stricken with a year of famine during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Allah), &#8220;If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism).&#8221; So the Prophet invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah&#8217;s Statement indicates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;we will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.10).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came upon &#8216;Abdullah and he said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited Quraish (to Islam), they disbelieved him and stood against him. So he (the Prophet) said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years of Joseph.&#8217; So they were stricken with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they started eating dead animals, and if one of them got up he would see something like smoke between him and the sky from the severe fatigue and hunger.&#8221; Abdullah then recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. This is a painful torment&#8230; (till he reached) &#8230;&#8230;.. We shall indeed remove the punishment for a while, but truly you will revert (to heathenism): (44.10-15) &#8216;Abdullah added: &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He added,&#8221; The severe grasp&#8221; was the Day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 349:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah sent (the Prophet) Muhammad and said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say, No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an) nor am I one of the pretenders (i.e. a person who pretends things which do not exist). (38.68) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw Quraish standing against him, he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years (of famine) of Joseph. So they were afflicted with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they ate bones and hides. (One of them said), &#8220;And they ate hides and dead animals, and (it seemed to them that) something like smoke was coming out of the earth. So Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Your people are on the verge of destruction! Please invoke Allah to relieve them.&#8221; So the Prophet invoked Allah for them (and the famine disappeared). He said to them. &#8220;You will revert (to heathenism) after that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;&#8230;.but truly you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; He added, &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them in the Hereafter? The smoke and the grasp and the Al-Lizam have all passed.&#8221; One of the sub-narrater said, &#8220;The splitting of the moon.&#8221; And another said, &#8220;The defeat of the Romans (has passed).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Marwan had been appointed as the governor of Hijaz by Muawiya. He delivered a sermon and mentioned Yazid bin Muawiya so that the people might take the oath of allegiance to him as the successor of his father (Muawiya). Then &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr told him something whereupon Marwan ordered that he be arrested. But &#8216;Abdur-Rahman entered &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house and they could not arrest him. Marwan said, &#8220;It is he (&#8216;AbdurRahman) about whom Allah revealed this Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And the one who says to his parents: &#8216;Fie on you! Do you hold out the promise to me..?'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, &#8216;Aisha said from behind a screen, &#8220;Allah did not reveal anything from the Qur&#8217;an about us except what was connected with the declaration of my innocence (of the slander).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet), I never saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle laughing loudly enough to enable me to see his uvula, but he used to smile only. And whenever he saw clouds or winds, signs of deep concern would appear on his face. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! When people see clouds they usually feel happy, hoping that it would rain, while I see that when you see clouds, one could notice signs of dissatisfaction on your face.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! What is the guarantee for me that there will be no punishment in it, since some people were punished with a wind? Verily, some people saw (received) the punishment, but (while seeing the cloud) they said, &#8216;This cloud will give us rain.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

He asked again, but he did not reply, and then he asked (for the third time) but he did not reply. On that, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said to himself, &#8220;Thakilat Ummu &#8216;Umar (May &#8216;Umar&#8217;s mother lose her son)! I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle three times but he did not reply.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;I made my camel run faster and went ahead of the people, and I was afraid that some Qur&#8217;anic Verses might be revealed about me. But before getting involved in any other matter. I heard somebody calling me. I said to myself, &#8216;I fear that some Qur&#8217;anic Verses have been revealed about me,&#8217; and so I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greeted him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Which is in the Qur&#8217;an, appears in the Surah thus: &#8216;Verily We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner, and as a protector for the illiterates (i.e., the Arabs.) You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Allah). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets. You do not return evil for evil, but excuse and forgive. Allah will not take you unto Him till He guides through you a crocked (curved) nation on the right path by causing them to say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; With such a statement He will cause to open blind eyes, deaf ears and hardened hearts.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Abu Wail to ask him (about those who had rebelled against &#8216;Ali). On that Abu Wail said, &#8220;We were at Siffin (a city on the bank of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between &#8216;Ali and Muawiya) A man said, &#8220;Will you be on the side of those who are called to consult Allah&#8217;s Book (to settle the dispute)?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the Qur&#8217;an).&#8221; &#8216; Some people objected to &#8216;Ali&#8217;s agreement and wanted to fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, &#8216;Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time &#8216;Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won&#8217;t our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.&#8221; So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab!

They were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet when a mission from Bani Tamim came to him. One of the two recommended Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas, the brother of Bani Mujashi (to be their governor) while the other recommended somebody else. (Nafi&#8217;, the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name). Abu Bakr said to Umar, &#8220;You wanted nothing but to oppose me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you.&#8221; Their voices grew loud in that argument, so Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.&#8217; (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;Since the revelation of this Verse, &#8216;Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet had to ask him to repeat his statements.&#8221; But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr).</p>

I will bring you his news.&#8221; So he went to Thabit and found him sitting in his house and bowing his head. The man said to Thabit, &#8221; &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8221; Thabit replied that it was an evil affair, for he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds had been annulled, and he considered himself as one of the people of the Fire. Then the man returned to the Prophet and told him that Thabit had said, so-and-so. (Musa bin Anas) said: The man returned to Thabit with great glad tidings. The Prophet said to the man. &#8220;Go back to him and say to him: &#8220;You are not from the people of the Hell Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221;</p>

Why do only the weak and the humble among the people enter me?&#8217; On that, Allah said to Paradise. &#8216;You are My Mercy which I bestow on whoever I wish of my servants.&#8217; Then Allah said to the (Hell) Fire, &#8216;You are my (means of) punishment by which I punish whoever I wish of my slaves. And each of you will have its fill.&#8217; As for the Fire (Hell), it will not be filled till Allah puts His Foot over it whereupon it will say, &#8216;Qati! Qati!&#8217; At that time it will be filled, and its different parts will come closer to each other; and Allah will not wrong any of His created beings. As regards Paradise, Allah will create a new creation to fill it with.&#8221;</p>

I am an Ansari man and do not belong to them (Quraish infidels) while the emigrants who were with you had their relatives who used to protect their families and properties at Mecca.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha the wife of the Prophet, said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine the believing women who migrated to him in accordance with this Verse: &#8216;O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance to you&#8230; Verily! Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8217; (60.12) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;And if any of the believing women accepted the condition (assigned in the above-mentioned Verse), Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her. &#8220;I have accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8221; &#8220;He would only say that, for, by Allah, his hand never touched, any lady during that pledge of allegiance. He did not receive their pledge except by saying, &#8220;I have accepted your pledge of allegiance for that.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They will not associate anything in worship with Allah,&#8217; and forbade us to bewail the dead. Thereupon a lady withdrew her hand (refrained from taking the oath of allegiance), and said, &#8220;But such-and-such lady lamented over one of my relatives, so I must reward (do the same over the dead relatives of) hers.&#8221; The Prophet did not object to that, so she went (there) and returned to the Prophet so he accepted her pledge of allegiance.</p>

(Sufyan, the subnarrator, often said that the Prophet: added, &#8220;Whoever among you fulfills his pledge, will receive his reward from Allah, and whoever commits any of those sins and receives the legal punishment (in this life), his punishment will be an expiation for that sin; and whoever commits any of those sins and Allah screens him, then it is up to Allah to punish or forgive them.&#8221;</p>

Once the Prophet (after completing the prayer and the sermon) came down, as if I am now looking at him waving at the men with his hand to sit down, and walked through them till he, along with Bilal, reached (the rows of) the women. Then he recited: &#8216;O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance that they will not worship anything other than Allah, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, will not kill their children, and will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (by making illegal children belonging to their husbands)&#8217;&#8230;.(60.12) Having finished, he said, &#8216;Do you agree to that?&#8221; One lady, other than whom none replied the Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; (The, sub-narrator, Al-Hasan did not know who the lady was.)

At that time, Salman Al-Farisi was with us.

So Allah&#8217;s Apostle disbelieved my saying and believed his. I was distressed as I never was before.

<p style="text-align:justify;">For the whole year I had the desire to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They were Hafsa and &#8216;Aisha.&#8221; Then I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you.&#8221; Then Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, &#8220;I recommend that you do so-and-so.&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?&#8221; She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don&#8217;t want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!&#8221; &#8216;Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;O my daughter! Do you argue with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?&#8221; H. afsa said, &#8220;By Allah, we argue with him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Know that I warn you of Allah&#8217;s punishment and the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . . O my daughter! Don&#8217;t be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for her (i.e. &#8216;Aisha).&#8221; &#8216;Umar addled, &#8220;Then I went out to Um Salama&#8217;s house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives!&#8217; By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, &#8220;Open Open!&#8217; I said, &#8216;Has the king of Ghassan come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but something worse; Allah&#8217;s Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let the nose of &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!&#8217; Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, &#8216;Say (to the Prophet ) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.&#8217; Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.&#8217; &#8216;Why are you weeping?&#8217; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah&#8217;s Apostle though you are, is living in destitute&#8221;. The Prophet then replied. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?&#8217; &#8220;</p>

While we were in Zahran, &#8216;Umar went to answer the call of nature and told me to follow him with some water for ablution. So I followed him with a container of water and started pouring water for him. I found it a good opportunity to ask him, so I said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out along with a group of his companions towards &#8216;Ukaz Market. At that time something intervened between the devils and the news of the Heaven, and flames were sent down upon them, so the devils returned. Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? &#8221; They said, &#8220;Something has intervened between us and the news of the Heaven, and fires (flames) have been shot at us.&#8221; Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;Nothing has intervened between you and the news of the Heaven, but an important event has happened. Therefore, travel all over the world, east and west, and try to find out what has happened.&#8221; And so they set out and travelled all over the world, east and west, looking for that thing which intervened between them and the news of the Heaven. Those of the devils who had set out towards Tihama, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at Nakhla (a place between Mecca and Taif) while he was on his way to Ukaz Market. (They met him) while he was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Holy Qur&#8217;an being recited (by Allah&#8217;s Apostle), they listened to it and said (to each other). This is the thing which has intervened between you and the news of the Heavens.&#8221; Then they returned to their people and said, &#8220;O our people! We have really heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an). It gives guidance to the right, and we have believed therein. We shall not join in worship, anybody with our Lord.&#8221; (See 72.1-2) Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (Surat al-Jinn):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: It has been revealed to me that a group (3 to 9) of Jinns listened (to the Qur&#8217;an).&#8217; (72.1) The statement of the Jinns was revealed to him .</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was in seclusion in the cave of Hiram&#8217;, and after I completed the limited period of my seclusion. I came down (from the cave) and heard a voice calling me. I looked to my right, but saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw something. So I went to Khadija (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) and told her to wrap me up and pour cold water on me. So they wrapped me up and poured cold water on me.&#8221; Then, &#8216;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped up! Arise and warn,&#8217; (Surat Al Muddaththir) was revealed.&#8221; (74.1)</p>

I was too much afraid of him (so I returned to my house) and said, &#8216;Fold me up in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me up.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn&#8230;and desert the idols.&#8221; (74.1-5) Abu Salama said&#8230;.Rujz means idols.&#8221; After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to move his tongue when the divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. (Sufyan, a subnarrator, demonstrated (how the Prophet used to move his lips) and added. &#8220;In order to memorize it.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked Said bin Jubair regarding (the statement of Allah). &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that the Prophet used to move his lips when the Divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. So the Prophet was ordered not to move his tongue, which he used to do, lest some words should escape his memory. &#8216;It is for Us to collect it&#8217; means, We will collect it in your chest;&#8217; and its recitation&#8217; means, We will make you recite it. &#8216;But when We recite it (i.e. when it is revealed to you), follow its recital; it is for Us to explain it and make it clear,&#8217; (i.e. We will explain it through your tongue).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Allah&#8217;s Apostle , he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Allah revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection&#8230;&#8217; (75) the Verses:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Quran) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn Abbas added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur&#8217;an) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, &#8220;When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it,&#8221; means, &#8216;It is for us to explain it through your tongue.&#8217; So whenever Gabriel came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216; he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Allah promised him.</p>

For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery.&#8221; Then he recited: &#8216;As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.&#8217; (92.5-10)</p>

Shall we not depend upon what has been written for us and give up deeds? He said, &#8220;Carry on doing (good) deeds, for everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created. So he who is destined to be among the happy (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of such people, while he who is destined to be among the miserable ones, will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of such people.&#8221; Then he recited:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, &#8220;Cover me!&#8221; They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, &#8220;O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me.&#8221; Then he told her the story. Khadija said, &#8220;Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities.&#8221; Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija&#8217;s paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say.&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young.&#8221; He added some other statement. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Will these people drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly.&#8221; But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was very much grieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. &#8220;Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.&#8217; He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!&#8221; So they covered him and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salama said, &#8220;(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship.&#8221; After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A man may keep them (for Allah&#8217;s Cause) to receive a reward in the Hereafter; another may keep them as a means of protection; and a third may keep them to be a burden for him. As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Allah&#8217;s Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a source of) reward for such a man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause, then that horse will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.&#8217; (99.7-8)</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Military Expeditions led by the Prophet(Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) (Al-Maghaazi) </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.285">Volume 5, Book 59, Number 285: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Ishaq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was sitting beside Zaid bin Al-Arqam, he was  asked, &#8220;How many Ghazwat did the Prophet undertake?&#8221; Zaid replied,  &#8220;Nineteen.&#8221; They said, &#8220;In how many Ghazwat did you join him?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Seventeen.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Which of these was the first?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Al-&#8216;Ashira or Al-&#8216;Ashiru.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.286"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 286: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>From Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh: Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh was an intimate friend  of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad,  and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived  at Medina, Sa&#8217;d went to perform &#8216;Umra and stayed at Umaiya&#8217;s home in Mecca. He said to  Umaiya, &#8220;Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to  perform Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met  them and said, &#8220;O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;He is Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, &#8220;I see you wandering about  safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have  changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and  support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be  able to go your family safely.&#8221; Sad, raising his voice, said to him, &#8220;By Allah,  if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent  you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through  Medina.&#8221; On this, Umaiya said to him, &#8220;O Sad do not raise your voice before  Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;O  Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle predicting that the Muslim will  kill you.&#8221; Umaiya asked, &#8220;In Mecca?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;  Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife,  &#8220;O Um Safwan! Don&#8217;t you know what Sad told me? &#8220;She said, &#8220;What has he told  you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions  that they will kill me. I asked him, &#8216;In Mecca?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I do not know.&#8221; Then  Umaiya added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.&#8221; But when the day of (the  Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, &#8220;Go and protect your  caravan.&#8221; But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said,  &#8220;O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the  people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.&#8221; Abu Jahl kept on urging  him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, &#8220;As you have forced me to change my mind, by  Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). &#8220;O Um  Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;O Abu Safwan!  Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I do  not want to go with them but for a short distance.&#8221; So when Umaiya went out, he used  to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Allah caused him to be  killed at Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I never failed to join Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any of his  Ghazawat except in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of  Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out  to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Allah caused them (i.e. Muslims) to meet their enemy  unexpectedly (with no previous intention) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 288: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would  have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e.  Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the Muslims to fight with the  pagans. Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your  Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in  front of you and behind you.&#8221; I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright with  happiness, for that saying delighted him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 289: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the battle of Badr, the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Allah! I appeal to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If Your Will is  that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans).&#8221; Then Abu Bakr took  hold of him by the hand and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for you.&#8221; The Prophet came  out saying, &#8220;Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their  backs.&#8221; (54.45) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of (the Prophet) Muhammad who took part in  Badr, told me that their number was that of Saul&#8217;s (i.e. Talut&#8217;s) companions who crossed  the river (of Jordan) with him and they were over three-hundred-and-ten men. By Allah,  none crossed the river with him but a believer. (See Qur&#8217;an 2:249) </font></p>

Then he returned and the enemy got hold of the bridle of his  (horse) and struck him two blows (with the sword) on his shoulder. Between these two  wounds there was a scar caused by a blow, he had received on the day of Badr (battle).  When I was a child I used to play with those scars by putting my fingers in them. On that  day (my brother) &#8220;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was also with him and he was ten years old.  Az-Zubair had carried him on a horse and let him to the care of some men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Badr, the Prophet ordered that the corpses of  twenty four leaders of Quraish should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr.  (It was a habit of the Prophet that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at  the battle-field for three nights. So, on the third day of the battle of Badr, he ordered  that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his companions followed him saying  among themselves.&#8221; &#8220;Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding for some  great purpose.&#8221; When he halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of  the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8220;O so-and-so, son of  so-and-so and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed  Allah and His Apostle? We have found true what our Lord promised us.

We said  (to her),&#8221;(Give us) the letter.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter.&#8221; Then we  made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we  will strip you naked.&#8221; When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below  her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter,  and we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This  Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!&#8221;  The Prophet asked Hatib, &#8220;What made you do this?&#8221; Hatib said, &#8220;By Allah, I  did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some  influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and  property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through  whom Allah protects his family and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has spoken  the truth; do no say to him but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He as betrayed Allah, His  Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and  said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, &#8216;I have forgiven  you.&#8221;&#8216; On this, tears came out of Umar&#8217;s eyes, and he said, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know better.&#8221; </font></p>

When they  reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, their presence was made known  to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent about one hundred archers after  them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of  dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, &#8220;These  dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&#8221; and went on tracing the Muslims&#8217; footsteps. When  &#8216;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the  enemy encircled them and said, &#8220;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise  and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit said, &#8220;O  people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O  Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&#8221; So the archers threw their arrows at them and  martyred &#8216;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise  and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers  got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with  them. The third man said, &#8220;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not  go with you for I follow the example of these.&#8221; He meant the martyred companions. The  archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid  bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca  after the event of the Badr battle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sons of Al-Harit bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for  he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin &#8216;Amr on the day (of the battle)  of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him.  One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public  hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers  went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the  razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said,  &#8220;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&#8221; Later on  (while narrating the story) she said, &#8220;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive  than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while  he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca.&#8221; She  used to say,&#8221; It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to  martyr him, Khubaib requested them. &#8220;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221;  They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been  afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.&#8221; Then he  (invoked evil upon them) saying, &#8220;O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and  do not leave anyone of them&#8221;&#8216; Then he recited: &#8220;As I am martyred as a Muslim, I  do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake, for this is for the Cause of  Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&#8221; Then Abu Sarva, &#8216;Ubqa  bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of  praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet  told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were  martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit&#8217;s death, sent some  messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for  he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a  swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of &#8216;Asim, and they shielded him from the  messengers who could not cut anything from his body. </font></p>

He died while she wa pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.&#8217; Soon after his  death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became  clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu&#8217;kak, a man from the tribe  of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, &#8220;What! I see you dressed up for the  people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Allah, you are not allowed to marry  unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband&#8217;s death).&#8221; Subai&#8217;a  in her narration said, &#8220;When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my  dress in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him about this problem. He gave  the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered  me to marry if I wished.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of  the battle of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the Khumus which  Allah had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to  Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani  Qainuqa &#8216;that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by  gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the  marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two  she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari&#8217;s dwelling and after collecting what  I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their  flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that,  I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done that?&#8221; They (i.e. the people)  said, &#8220;Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib has done it. He is present in this house with some  Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, &#8220;O  Hamza, get at the fat she-camels!&#8221; On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and cut  of the camels&#8217; humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their  livers.&#8221; Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The  Prophet noticed my state and asked, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two  she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a  house along some drinkers.&#8221; The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it on, and  proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza  was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming  Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the  Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his  face and then said, &#8220;You are not but my father&#8217;s slaves.&#8221; When the Prophet  understood that Hamza was drunk, he retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with  him. </font></p>

Some days later, Allah&#8217;s Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married  her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, &#8220;Perhaps you were angry with me when  you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr  said, &#8216;Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle , but had he (i.e. the Prophet) given her up I would surely have accepted  her.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, I am not afraid that you will be poor, but I fear that  worldly wealth will be bestowed upon you as it was bestowed upon those who lived before  you. So you will compete amongst yourselves for it, as they competed for it and it will  destroy you as it did them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That once &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was  sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Uthman,  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes, let them come in.&#8221; After a while, Yarfa-  came again and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas who are asking your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So, when the two entered, &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali). &#8220;Both of them  had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle  as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas started reproaching each  other. The (present) people (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the  believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the  earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets) our properties are  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,&#8217; and he said it  about himself?&#8221; They (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his company) said, &#8220;He did say it.  &#8220;&#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both, by  Allah! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said this?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative.  He said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His  Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give  to anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And what Allah gave to His Apostle  (&#8220;Fai&#8221;&#8221; Booty) from them&#8211;For which you made no expedition With either  Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And  Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; (59.6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  . But by Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it,  but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of  it. And from this Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and  whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s Property is spent (i.e. in  charity), Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and  Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge  of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and  all of you (at that time) knew all about it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and  &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have  described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and  the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for  the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere,  pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you  (i.e. &#8216;Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O  &#8216;Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our  property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; Then when I  thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you  will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or  else you should not speak to me (about it).&#8217; So, both of you said to me, &#8216;Hand it over to  us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now  to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the  sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision)  till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that  property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf.&#8221; The sub-narrator  said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, &#8216;Malik bin Aus has told  the truth&#8221; I heard &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, &#8216;The wives of the Prophet  sent &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted  to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don&#8217;t  you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we  leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added:  &#8216;The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the  Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.&#8217; So, this property (of Sadaqa) was  in the hands of Ali who withheld it from &#8216;Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the  hands of Hasan bin &#8216;Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin &#8216;Ali, and then in the hands of  Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn,  then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is willing to kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?&#8221; Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama got up  saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;Then allow me to say a (false) thing  (i.e. to deceive Kab). &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;You may say it.&#8221; Then Muhammad  bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &#8220;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e.  Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from  you.&#8221; On that, Kab said, &#8220;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&#8221; Muhammad  bin Maslama said, &#8220;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless  and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or  two of food.&#8221; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab  said, &#8220;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied,  &#8220;Mortgage your women to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women to  you and you are the most handsome of the &#8216;Arabs?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Then mortgage your  sons to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would  be abused by the people&#8217;s saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of  food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He  came to Kab at night along with Kab&#8217;s foster brother, Abu Na&#8217;ila. Kab invited them to come  into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &#8220;Where are you  going at this time?&#8221; Kab replied, &#8220;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster)  brother Abu Na&#8217;ila have come.&#8221; His wife said, &#8220;I hear a voice as if dropping  blood is from him, Ka&#8217;b said. &#8220;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and  my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if  invited to be killed.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators  mention the men as &#8216;Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin  Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &#8220;When Ka&#8217;b comes, I will  touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him.  I will let you smell his head.&#8221; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his  clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &#8221; have never smelt a  better scent than this. Ka&#8217;b replied. &#8220;I have got the best &#8216;Arab women who know how  to use the high class of perfume.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka&#8217;b &#8220;Will you  allow me to smell your head?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Muhammad smelt it and made  his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka&#8217;b again, &#8220;Will you let me  (smell your head)?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; When Muhammad got a strong hold of  him, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Get at him!&#8221; So they killed him and went to  the Prophet and informed him.

I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the  gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdullah proceeded towards the  castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending  to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered  &#8216;Abdullah as one of the castle&#8217;s servants) addressing him saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Servant!  Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added in his story,  &#8220;So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the  gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the  keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi for a  pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went  away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to  myself, &#8216;Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till  I have killed him.&#8217; So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his  family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; Abu  Rafi said, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the  sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out  of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, &#8216;What is this  voice, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a  sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the  sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized  that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase,  and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg  broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the  gate, and said, &#8216;I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.&#8217; So, when  (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall  saying, &#8216;I announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my  companions and said, &#8216;Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi,&#8217; So I (along  with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet and described the whole story to  him. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it  and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Atik and &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached  his castle, whereupon &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik said to them, &#8220;Wait (here), and in the  meantime I will go and see.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said later on, &#8220;I played a trick in order  to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a  flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my  head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, &#8216;Whoever  wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.&#8217; So I went in and hid myself in  a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and  had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices  vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the  gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked  the gate of the castle, saying to myself, &#8216;If these people should notice me, I will run  away easily.&#8217; Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were  inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with  its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; He  replied, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my  blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone  of my voice, &#8216; What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you not surprised? Woe  on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!&#8217; So again I aimed at him and  hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried loudly and his wife  got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying  straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the  sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase  to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to  my companions limping. I said (to them), &#8216;Go and tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle of this good news,  but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi&#8217;s) death.&#8217;  When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, &#8216;I convey to you  the news of Abu Rafi&#8217;s death.&#8217; I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I  caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good  news.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and  the Prophet placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed &#8216;Abdullah (bin  Jubair) as their commander and said, &#8220;Do not leave this place; and if you should see  us conquering the enemy, do not leave this place, and if you should see them conquering  us, do not (come to) help us,&#8221; So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heel  till I saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes from their  legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying, &#8220;The booty, the  booty!&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;The Prophet had taken a firm promise from me  not to leave this place.&#8221; But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused  (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they  suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, &#8220;Is Muhammad  present amongst the people?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abd Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab  amongst the people?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;All these people have been killed, for,  were they alive, they would have replied.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar could not help saying,  &#8220;You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.&#8221;  Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Superior may be Hubal!&#8221; On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have  (the idol) Al-&#8216;Uzza, whereas you have no &#8216;Uzza!&#8221; The Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is  always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead  men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.&#8221; Narrated  Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as  martyrs. </font></p>

Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon  us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have  been given to us in this life.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he  left the food. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We migrated in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, seeking  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Allah. Some of us have been dead  without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar  who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a  Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet  became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet  said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over  his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet.&#8221; But some amongst us have got the fruits of  their labor ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from  the battle of Badr and he said, &#8220;I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet  (i.e. Badr battle), and if Allah should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet,  Allah will see how strongly I will fight.&#8221; So he encountered the day of Uhud battle.  The Muslims fled and he said, &#8220;O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these  people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.&#8221;  Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh (fleeing), and asked him,  &#8220;Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.&#8221; Then he  proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister  recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds  caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their  Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they  have been Killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting&#8221; (33.23) So  we wrote this in its place in the Quran. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of  those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into  two groups. One group said, &#8220;We will fight them (i.e. the enemy),&#8221; and the other  group said, &#8220;We will not fight them.&#8221; So there came the Divine Revelation:&#8211; &#8216;(O  Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about  the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.&#8217;  (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which  clears one from one&#8217;s sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver.&#8221; </font></p>

My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who  are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought)  an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;You have done the right thing.&#8221; </font></p>

When the creditors saw  him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had  never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates  thrice, and then sat over it and said, &#8216;O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the  creditors).&#8217; Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till  Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of  those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved  all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet had been  sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof.&#8221; </font></p>

Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you.

Hudhaifa said, &#8220;May Allah forgive  you.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said, &#8220;By Allah, Hudhaifa continued asking  Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the killers of his father till he departed to Allah (i.e.  died).&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Uthman bin Mauhab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah&#8217;s) House. Seeing  some people sitting, he said, &#8220;Who are these sitting people?&#8221; Somebody said,  &#8220;They are the people of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man?&#8221; They  said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He went to him and said, &#8220;I want to ask you about  something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of  this (Sacred) House, do you know that &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan fled on the day of Uhud?&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know that he (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) was  absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance  (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Come along;  I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of &#8216;Uthman)  on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr  (battle), he was married to the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was ill, so the  Prophet said to him, &#8216;You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle  will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.&#8217; As for his absence from the  Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than  &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of &#8216;Uthman. So the  Prophet sent him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place  after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. &#8216;This is the  hand of &#8216;Uthman,&#8217; and clapped it over his other hand and said, &#8220;This is for  &#8216;Uthman.'&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then said (to the man), &#8220;Go now, after taking this  information.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jafar bin &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out with &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi Al-Khaiyar. When we  reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi said (to me), &#8220;Would you  like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to  us, &#8220;He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.&#8221; So  we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he  greeted us in return. &#8216;Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except  his eyes and feet. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;O Wahshi! Do you know me?&#8221; Wahshi looked  at him and then said, &#8220;No, by Allah! But I know that &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a  woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at  Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with  his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child&#8217;s  feet.&#8221; Then &#8216;Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), &#8220;Will you tell  us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?&#8221; Wahshi replied &#8220;Yes, Hamza killed  Tuaima bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said to  me, &#8216;If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free.&#8221; When the  people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of &#8216;Ainain ..&#8217;Ainain is a mountain  near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the  people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba&#8217; came out and said, &#8216;Is  there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?&#8217; Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib came out  and said, &#8216;O Siba&#8217;. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge  Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant  like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near  me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his  buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with  them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and  when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I was told that the  Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. When he saw me, he said, &#8216;Are you Wahshi?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was it you  who killed Hamza?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;What happened is what you have been told of.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Can  you hide your face from me?&#8217; So I went out when Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, and Musailamah  Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, &#8216;I will go out to Musailamah so  that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to  fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that  battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked  like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him,  driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders,  and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers  (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.&#8221; </font></p>

When Fatima saw that the water aggravated the  bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so  that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped).

Then he said, &#8220;I will be a witness  for them on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; He ordered them to be buried with their blood  (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed.  Jabir added, &#8220;When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face.  The companions of the Prophet stopped me from doing so but the Prophet did not stop me.

He did not leave behind except a sheet of striped woolen cloth. If we  covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his  head became naked. The Prophet said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir  (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet,&#8221; or said, &#8220;Put some Idhkhir over his  feet.&#8221; But some of us have got their fruits ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed &#8216;Asim bin  Thabit, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set  out, and when they reached (a place) between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one  of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed  their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. &#8216;Asim  and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey  food from Medina. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The archers said, &#8220;These are the dates of  Medina,&#8221; and followed their traces till they took them over. When &#8216;Asim and his  companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers  encircled them and said, &#8220;You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to  us, we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;As for me, I will never come  down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.&#8221; So they  fought with them till they killed &#8216;Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows,  and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a  covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When  they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The  third man who was with them said, &#8220;This is the first breach in the covenant,&#8221;  and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but  he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they  sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was  Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for  a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib  borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave  it to him. She said later on, &#8220;I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved  towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my  distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said &#8216;Are you afraid that I will  kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,&#8217; &#8221; Later on she used to say, &#8220;I  have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes  although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron  chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.&#8221; So they  took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, &#8220;Allow me to offer a  two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221; Then he went to them and said, &#8220;Had I not been afraid that  you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time.&#8221; So it  was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He  then said, &#8220;O Allah! Count them one by one,&#8221; and added, &#8216;When I am being  martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake,  because this death is in Allah&#8217;s Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish  (infidels) sent some people to &#8216;Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his  death might be known for certain, for &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of  Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who  could not harm his body consequently. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas said, &#8220;The Prophet sent seventy men, called  Al-Qurra &#8216;for some purpose. The two groups of Bani Sulaim called Ri&#8217;l and Dhakwan,  appeared to them near a well called Bir Ma&#8217;una. The people (i.e. Al-Qurra) said, &#8216;By  Allah, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something  for the Prophet.&#8217; But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked evil upon  them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used  not to say Qunut before that.&#8221; A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, &#8220;Is it to be  said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before  Bowing)?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;No, but (it is to be said) after finishing the  Recitation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Lihyan asked  Allah&#8217;s Apostle to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy. He  therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra&#8217; in  their lifetime. They used to collect wood by daytime and pray at night. When they were at  the well of Ma&#8217;una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the  Prophet , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of  the &#8216;Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of  the Qur&#8217;an revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled. It was:  &#8220;convey to our people on our behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He  is pleased with us, and has made us pleased.&#8221; (Anas bin Malik added:) Allah&#8217;s Prophet  said Qunut for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the &#8216;Arab  tribes (namely), Ril, Dhakwan, Usaiya, and Bani Libyan. (Anas added:) Those seventy Ansari  men were killed at the well of Mauna. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim  at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail proposed three  suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the  bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or  that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from  Bani Ghatafan.&#8221; But &#8216;Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He  said, &#8220;Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having  a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse.&#8221; So he died on the back of  his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from  so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of &#8216;Amir). Haram said (to his  companions), &#8220;Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should  give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go  back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, &#8220;Will you give me  protection so as to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So, he started talking  to them&#8217; but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him  (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of  the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e.  Haram&#8217;s companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain.  Then Allah revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: &#8216;We  have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.&#8217; (After this event)  the Prophet invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon  the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr asked the Prophet to allow him to go out (of  Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet said to him,  &#8221;Wait.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to  migrate)?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I hope so.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited for him  till one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle came at noon time and addressed him saying &#8220;Let whoever  is present with you, now leave you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;None is present but my two  daughters.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go  out (to migrate)?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would like to accompany  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You will accompany me.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our)  going out.&#8221; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet and it was Al-Jad&#8217;a  . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where  they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of &#8216;Abdullah bin Al-Tufail bin  Sakhbara &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s brother from her mother&#8217;s side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir  used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them  before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and  then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his  job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. &#8216;Amir) too went  along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns  till they reached Medina. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma&#8217;una. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma&#8217;una were  martyred and &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail, pointing at  a killed person, asked Amr, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya said to him, &#8220;He  is &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira.&#8221; &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail said, &#8220;I saw him lifted to the sky  after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought  down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he  announced the news of their death saying, &#8220;Your companions (of Bir Ma&#8217;una) have been  killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us  as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us.&#8221; So Allah informed them (i.e.  the Prophet and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that day, &#8216;Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt who was one of  them, was killed, and Urwa (bin Az-Zubair) was named after &#8216;Urwa bin Asma and Mundhir (bin  AzZubair) was named after Mundhir bin &#8216;Amr (who had also been martyred on that day). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet invoked evil upon those (people) who killed his  companions at Bir Mauna for 30 days (in the morning prayer). He invoked evil upon (tribes  of) Ril, Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. Allah revealed a Quranic  Verse to His Prophet regarding those who had been killed, i.e. the Muslims killed at Bir  Ma&#8217;una, and we recited the Verse till later it was cancelled.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas bin Malik regarding Al-Qunut during the  prayer. Anas replied, &#8220;Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet in the prayer).&#8221; I  said, &#8220;Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;(It was said)  before (Bowing).&#8221; I said, &#8220;So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was  said after Bowing.&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He was mistaken, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet had sent some people called Al-Qurra who  were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah&#8217;s Apostle violated the treaty  (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the  prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them. </font></p>

There is no  goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar  and the Emigrants.&#8221; The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to  be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having  a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who  were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq (  i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;Here is a rock appearing across the trench.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am coming  down.&#8221; Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten  anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck the big solid rock and  it became like sand. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to go home.&#8221; (When the  Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife, &#8220;I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot  treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have  barley and a she goat.&#8221; So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then  we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the dough  had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly  been well-cooked, and said, &#8220;I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the food).&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;How much is that food?&#8221; I told him about it. He said, &#8220;It is abundant and  good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out  any bread from the oven till I reach there.&#8221; Then he said (to all his companions),  &#8220;Get up.&#8221; So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to  my wife, I said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the  Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did  the Prophet ask you (how much food you had)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said, &#8220;Enter and do not throng.&#8221; The Prophet started cutting the bread  (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven  whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take  the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his  companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the  Prophet said (to my wife), &#8220;Eat and present to others as the people are struck with  hunger.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet in the state of  severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, &#8220;Have you got anything (to eat),  for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a state of severe hunger.&#8221; She brought out for me,  a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I  slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my  job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an  earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . My wife said, &#8220;Do not  disgrace me in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and those who are with him.&#8221; So I went to him  and said to him secretly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e.  kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and  another person along with you.&#8221; The Prophet raised his voice and said, &#8220;O people  of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough  till I come.&#8221; So I came (to my house) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle too, came, proceeding  before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, &#8220;May Allah do so-and-so to  you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have told the Prophet of what you said.&#8221; Then she brought  out to him (i.e. the Prophet the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah&#8217;s  Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and  invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake  along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not  put it down from its fireplace.&#8221; They were one-thousand (who took their meals), and  by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was  still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being  baked as if nothing had been taken from it. </font></p>

Muawiya addressed the people saying, &#8220;&#8216;If anybody wants to say  anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for  we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father.&#8221; On that, Habib bin  Masalama said (to Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?&#8221;  &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs  while I was sitting and was about to say, &#8216;He who fought against you and against your  father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,&#8217; but I was afraid that my  statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my  statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah  has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the  Hereafter to this worldly life).&#8221; Habib said, &#8220;You did what kept you safe and  secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a  man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-&#8216;Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban  bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai who shot an arrow at Sad&#8217;s  medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the  Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from  the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel  came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, &#8220;You  have laid down the arms?&#8221; By Allah, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to  attack them).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Where?&#8221; Gabriel pointed towards Bani  Quraiza. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They  then surrendered to the Prophet&#8217;s judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict  concerning them. Sad said, &#8220;I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed,  their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties  distributed.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;Sad said, &#8220;O Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to  fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of  Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e.  Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then  keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to  an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.&#8217; So blood gushed from the  wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the  blood flowing towards them . They said, &#8216;O people of the tent! What is this thing which is  coming to us from your side?&#8217; Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad&#8217;s wound. Sad  then died because of that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 462: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take with him the one on  whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot  fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the  women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried  down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night  that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and  went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to  my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar  beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to  look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who  used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel  on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were  light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in  abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the  lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a  young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my  necklace after the army had gone. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of  them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used  to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was  sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal  As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he  saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me  before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited  Istirja&#8217; (i.e. &#8220;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&#8217;un&#8221;) as soon as he recognized  me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single  word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&#8217;. He dismounted from his  camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode  on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in  the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the  event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk  (i.e. slander) more, was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Urwa said, &#8220;The people propagated the slander and  talked about it in his (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it  and asked about it to let it prevail.&#8221; Urwa also added, &#8220;None was mentioned as  members of the slanderous group besides (&#8216;Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah  bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but  they were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander  was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha disliked to have Hassan  abused in her presence and she used to say, &#8216;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e.  my father&#8217;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&#8217;s honor from  you.&#8221;). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;After we returned to Medina, I became  ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while  I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not  receiving the same kindness from Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick.  (But now) Allah&#8217;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&#8217; How is that (lady)?&#8217; and  leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went  out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&#8217; where we used to  answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except  at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our  concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &#8216;Arabs living in  the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and  Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was  the daughter of Sakhr bin &#8216;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was  Mistah bin Uthatha bin &#8216;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my  house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her  foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined!&#8217; I said,  &#8216;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&#8217;  On that she said, &#8216;O you Hantah! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &#8216;I said,  &#8216;What did he say?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my  ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after  greeting me, said, &#8216;How is that (lady)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8217;  as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me (and I went  to my parents) and asked my mother, &#8216;O mother! What are the people talking about?&#8217; She  said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by  her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would  find faults with her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the  people really talking in this way?&#8217; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither  stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine  Inspiration was delayed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin  Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my  innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&#8217; &#8216;Ali bin  Abi Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are  plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&#8217; On  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &#8216;O Barira! Did you  ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&#8217; Barira said to him, &#8216;By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal,  except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that  the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, on that day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and  complained about &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &#8216;O you  Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about  my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man  about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&#8217;  Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh the brother of Banu &#8216;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I  will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head  off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill  your order.&#8217; On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his  branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was  a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&#8217;adh). &#8216;By  Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your  people, you would not wish him to be killed.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin  Mu&#8217;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8216;By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill  him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.&#8217; On this, the two tribes  of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they  became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing,  and I could never sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two  nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that  my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was  weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and  when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of  the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &#8216;Amma Badu, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been  informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your  innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for  forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah  accepts his repentance.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased  flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my  father, &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; My father  said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Then I said to my mother,  &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah,  I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; In spite of the fact that I was a young  girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8216;By Allah, no doubt I know that you  heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and  you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe  me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely  believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&#8217;s father  when he said, &#8216;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is  Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my  bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my  innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine  Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be  talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might  have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to  overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body  like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which  was being revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, he got up smiling,  and the first word he said was, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!&#8217; Then my  Mother said to me, &#8216;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I replied, &#8216;By Allah, I  will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:&#8211;  &#8220;Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;  (24.11-20) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my  innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of  his relationship to him and his poverty, said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give to Mistah bin  Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.&#8217; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those among you who are good and wealthy  swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have  left their homes for Allah&#8217;s cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that  Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8216;Yes, by Allah, I would like that  Allah forgive me.&#8217; and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also  added, &#8216;By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at all.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha further said:.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked  Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, &#8216;What do you know and  what did you see?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain from claiming  falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about  &#8216;Aisha).&#8217; From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the  love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her  piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with  those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand  my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.&#8217; Later on the man  was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Ruman, the mother of &#8216;Aisha said that while &#8216;Aisha and  she were sitting, an Ansari woman came and said, &#8220;May Allah harm such and-such a  person!&#8221; Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;My son  was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).&#8221; Um Ruman said,  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; She said, &#8220;So-and-so&#8230;.&#8221; and narrated the whole  story. On that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle hear about that?&#8221; She replies,  &#8220;yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And Abu Bakr too?&#8221; She replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Aisha fell down fainting, and when she came to her senses, she  had got fever with rigors. I put her clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet came  and asked, &#8220;What is wrong with this (lady)?&#8221; Um Ruman replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! She (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) has got temperature with rigors.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Perhaps  it is because of the story that has been talked about?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha sat up and said, &#8220;By Allah, if I took an oath (that I am innocent), you would  not believe me, and if I said (that I am not innocent), you would not excuse me. My and  your example is like that of Jacob and his sons (as Jacob said ): &#8216;It is Allah (Alone)  Whose Help can be sought against that you assert.&#8217; Um Ruman said, &#8220;The Prophet then  went out saying nothing. Then Allah declared her innocence. On that, &#8216;Aisha said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;I thank Allah only; thank neither anybody else nor you.&#8221; </font></p>

We really consider  that the actual Victory was the Ar-Ridwan Pledge of allegiance which we gave on the day of  Al-Hudaibiya (to the Prophet) . On the day of Al-Hudaibiya we were fourteen hundred men  along with the Prophet Al-Hudaibiya was a well, the water of which we used up leaving not  a single drop of water in it. When the Prophet was informed of that, he came and sat on  its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his  mouth), invoked (Allah), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for  a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our  riding animals. </font></p>

When they informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle of that, he came and sat over  its edge and said, &#8220;Bring me a bucket of its water.&#8221; When it was brought, he  spat and invoked (Allah) and said, &#8220;Leave it for a while.&#8221; Then they quenched  their thirst and watered their riding animals (from that well) till they departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir said &#8220;On the day of Al-Hudaibiya, the people  felt thirsty and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a utensil containing water. He performer ablution  from it and then the people came towards him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; The people said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We haven&#8217;t got any water to perform ablution  with or to drink, except what you have in your utensil.&#8217; So the Prophet put his hand in  the utensil and the water started spouting out between his fingers like springs. So we  drank and performed ablution.&#8221; I said to Jabir, &#8220;What was your number on that  day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one hundred thousand, that water would  have been sufficient for us. Anyhow, we were 1500.&#8217; </font></p>

The Prophet proceeded on till he reached (a village called)  Ghadir-al-Ashtat. There his spy came and said, &#8220;The Quraish (infidels) have collected  a great number of people against you, and they have collected against you the Ethiopians,  and they will fight with you, and will stop you from entering the Ka&#8217;ba and prevent  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O people! Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I  should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka&#8217;ba? If  they should come to us (for peace) then Allah will destroy a spy from the pagans, or  otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) and  you do not want to kill or fight anybody. So proceed to it, and whoever should stop us  from it, we will fight him.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed on, in the Name  of Allah !&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama relating one of the events that happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the &#8216;Umra of  Al-Hudaibiya. They said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded the truce with Suhail bin  &#8216;Amr on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, one of the conditions which Suhail bin &#8216;Amr stipulated,  was his saying (to the Prophet), &#8220;If anyone from us (i.e. infidels) ever comes to  you, though he has embraced your religion, you should return him to us, and should not  interfere between us and him.&#8221; Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on this condition. The believers disliked this condition and got disgusted  with it and argued about it. But when Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on that condition, Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded it. Accordingly, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then returned Abu Jandal bin Suhail to his father, Suhail bin &#8216;Amr, and returned  every man coming to him from them during that period even if he was a Muslim. The  believing women Emigrants came (to Medina) and Um Kulthum, the daughter of &#8216;Uqba bin Abi  Mu&#8217;ait was one of those who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was an adult at that time. Her  relatives came, asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle to return her to them, and in this connection,  Allah revealed the Verses dealing with the believing (women). Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to test all the believing women who migrated to him, with the following  Verse:&#8211; &#8220;O Prophet! When the believing Women come to you, to give the pledge of  allegiance to you.&#8221; (60.12) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam  before &#8216;Umar. This is not true. What happened is that &#8216;Umar sent &#8216;Abdullah to bring his  horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the people were giving the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle near the Tree, and &#8216;Umar was not aware of that. So  Abdullah (bin Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the  horse and brought it to &#8216;Umar. While &#8216;Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for  fighting, &#8216;Abdullah informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beneath the Tree. So &#8216;Umar set out and &#8216;Abdullah accompanied him till he  gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and it was this event that made people  say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam before &#8216;Umar. &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar added,  &#8220;The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the  shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at  him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and looking at him.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge  o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of allegiance and returned to  &#8216;Umar who went out in his turn and gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet when he performed the  &#8216;Umra.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Sahl bin Hunaif returned from (the battle of) Siffin,  we went to ask him (as to why he had come back). He replied, &#8220;(You should not  consider me a coward) but blame your opinions. I saw myself on the day of Abu Jandal  (inclined to fight), and if I had the power of refusing the order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle then,  I would have refused it (and fought the infidels bravely). Allah and His Apostle know  (what is convenient) better. Whenever we put our swords on our shoulders for any matter  that terrified us, our swords led us to an easy agreeable solution before the present  situation (of disagreement and dispute between the Muslims). When we mend the breach in  one side, it opened in another, and we do not know what to do about it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people of the tribe of &#8216;Ukl and &#8216;Uraina arrived at  Medina to meet the Prophet and embraced Islam and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are  the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen).&#8221;  They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they  should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of  Medina and to drink the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they  reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the  shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he  sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet  ). The Prophet gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of  iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died  in that state of theirs. (See Hadith 234 Vol 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the  first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to graze at a place  called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me (on the way) and said,  &#8220;The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been taken away by force.&#8221; I asked,  &#8220;Who had taken them?&#8221; He replied &#8220;(The people of) Ghatafan.&#8221; I made  three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; I made the  people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up  with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as  I was a good archer and I was saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, and today will  perish the wicked people.&#8221; I kept on saying like that till I restored the she-camels  (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet  and the other people came there, and I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I have stopped the  people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people)  after them now.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;! You have  over-powered them, so forgive them.&#8221; Then we all came back and Allah&#8217;s Apostle seated  me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out in the company of the Prophet in the year of  Khaibar, and when we reached As Sahba&#8217; which is the lower part of Khaibar, the Prophet  offered the Asr prayer and then asked the people to collect the journey food. Nothing was  brought but Sawiq which the Prophet ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it  and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and  we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 509: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While  we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to &#8216;Amir, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Won&#8217;t you  let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for  the people poetry that kept pace with the camels&#8217; footsteps, saying:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!  Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In  charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our  defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon  us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An  unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others&#8217; help  Against us.&#8221; The Prophet on that, asked, &#8220;Who is that (camel) driver (reciting  poetry)?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on  him.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! has (martyrdom) been  granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; Then we reached and  besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims  conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the  Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &#8220;What are these fires? For cooking what,  are you making the fire?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;(For cooking) meat.&#8221; He  asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They (i.e. people) said, &#8220;The meat of  donkeys.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&#8221; Some  man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots  instead?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Yes, you can do) that too.&#8221; So when the army files  were arranged in rows (for the clash), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was short and he aimed at the leg of  a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own  knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw  me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &#8220;What is bothering you?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the  deeds of &#8216;Amir are lost.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so, is mistaken, for  &#8216;Amir has got a double reward.&#8221; The Prophet raised two fingers and added, &#8220;He  (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few &#8216;Arabs who  achieved the like of (good deeds) &#8216;Amir had done.&#8221; </font></p>

When it was morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when  they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, &#8220;Muhammad! By Allah! Muhammad and his  army!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a  (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been  warned.&#8221; </font></p>

Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile)  nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned.&#8221; We  then got the meat of donkeys (and intended to eat it), but an announcement was made by the  announcer of the Prophet, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle forbid you to eat the meat of  donkeys as it is an impure thing.&#8221; </font></p>

Somebody said, &#8220;None has benefited the Muslims today more than  so-and-so.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is from the people of the  Hell-Fire certainly.&#8221; A man amongst the people (i.e. Muslims) said, &#8220;I will  accompany him (to know the fact).&#8221; So he went along with him, and whenever he stopped  he stopped with him, and whenever he hastened, he hastened with him. The (brave) man then  got wounded severely, and seeking to die at once, he planted his sword into the ground and  put its point against his chest in between his breasts, and then threw himself on it and  committed suicide. On that the person (who was accompanying the deceased all the time)  came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Why is that (what makes you say so)?&#8221; He said &#8220;It is  concerning the man whom you have already mentioned as one of the dwellers of the  Hell-Fire. The people were surprised by your statement, and I said to them, &#8220;I will  try to find out the truth about him for you.&#8221; So I went out after him and he was then  inflicted with a severe wound and because of that, he hurried to bring death upon himself  by planting the handle of his sword into the ground and directing its tip towards his  chest between his breasts, and then he threw himself over it and committed suicide.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;A man may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the  dwellers of Paradise but he is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and another may do what  seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the  dwellers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

Some of the people were about to  doubt (the Prophet&#8217;s statement), but the man, feeling the pain of his wounds, put his hand  into his quiver and took out of it, some arrows with which he slaughtered himself (i.e.  committed suicide). Then some men amongst the Muslims came hurriedly and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true so-and-so has committed suicide.  &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;O so-and-so! Get up and make an announcement that none but a  believer will enter Paradise and that Allah may support the religion with an unchaste  (evil) wicked man. </font></p>

He then said, &#8220;(How can) I remain  behind the Prophet ,&#8221; and followed him. So when he slept on the night of the conquest  of Khaibar, the Prophet said, &#8220;I will give the flag tomorrow, or tomorrow the flag  will be taken by a man who is loved by Allah and His Apostle , and (Khaibar) will be  conquered through him, (with Allah&#8217;s help)&#8221; While every one of us was hopeful to have  the flag, it was said, &#8220;Here is &#8216;Ali&#8221; and the Prophet gave him the flag and  Khaibar was conquered through him (with Allah&#8217;s Help). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Khaibar, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow  I will give this flag to a man through whose hands Allah will give us victory. He loves  Allah and His Apostle, and he is loved by Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The people remained  that night, wondering as to who would be given it. In the morning the people went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and everyone of them was hopeful to receive it (i.e. the flag). The  Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;He is suffering  from eye trouble O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him.&#8221; &#8216;Ali was  brought and Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat in his eye and invoked good upon him. So &#8216;Ali was cured  as if he never had any trouble. Then the Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will fight with them till they become like us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Proceed and do not hurry. When you enter their territory, call them to embrace  Islam and inform them of Allah&#8217;s Rights which they should observe, for by Allah, even if a  single man is led on the right path (of Islam) by Allah through you, then that will be  better for you than the nice red camels. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We arrived at Khaibar, and when Allah helped His Apostle to  open the fort, the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtaq whose husband had been killed  while she was a bride, was mentioned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet selected her for  himself, and set out with her, and when we reached a place called Sidd-as-Sahba,&#8217; Safiya  became clean from her menses then Allah&#8217;s Apostle married her. Hais (i.e. an &#8216;Arabian  dish) was prepared on a small leather mat. Then the Prophet said to me, &#8220;I invite the  people around you.&#8221; So that was the marriage banquet of the Prophet and Safiya. Then  we proceeded towards Medina, and I saw the Prophet, making for her a kind of cushion with  his cloak behind him (on his camel). He then sat beside his camel and put his knee for  Safiya to put her foot on, in order to ride (on the camel). </font></p>

I invited the Muslim to h s marriage banquet and there  wa neither meat nor bread in that banquet but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the  leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put. The Muslims said amongst  themselves, &#8220;Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one  of the wives of the Prophet ) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand  possesses&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then  she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet&#8217;s wives), and if  he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave.&#8221; So when he  departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his and made her observe the veil. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to  Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were  (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu  Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my  people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met  Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet  at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the  people of the ship, &#8220;We have migrated before you.&#8221; Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who was one  of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had  migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. &#8216;Umar came to Hafsa while  Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais was with her. &#8216;Umar, on seeing Asma,&#8217; said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She  said, &#8220;Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais,&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the  sea-faring lady?&#8221; Asma&#8217; replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We have migrated  before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah&#8217;s Apostle  &#8221; On that Asma&#8217; became angry and said, &#8220;No, by Allah, while you were with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones  amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I  will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add  something to it.&#8221; So when the Prophet came, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet &#8216;Umar  has said so-and-so.&#8221; He said (to Asma&#8217;), &#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221; Asma&#8217;s  aid, &#8220;I told him so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. &#8216;Umar) has not got  more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one  migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations.&#8221;  Asma&#8217; later on said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in  successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was  more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Asma&#8217; said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa  requesting me to repeat this narration again and again.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur&#8217;an,  when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their  voices when they are reciting the Qur&#8217;an at night although I have not seen their houses  when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Hakim who, on meeting the  cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to  wait for them.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

While the slave was  dismounting the saddle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an arrow the thrower of which was unknown, came  and hit him. The people said, &#8220;Congratulations to him for the martyrdom.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the sheet (of cloth)  which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before the  distribution of the booty, has become a flame of Fire burning him.&#8221; On hearing that,  a man brought one or two leather straps of shoes to the Prophet and said, &#8220;These are  things I took (illegally).&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This is a strap, or  these are two straps of Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 546: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr  (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the  property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in  Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr  said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave,  is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.&#8217; By Allah, I  will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and will leave it  as it was during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to do.&#8221; So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she  became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died.  She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her  husband &#8216;Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral  prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect &#8216;Ali much, but after  her death, &#8216;Ali noticed a change in the people&#8217;s attitude towards him. So Ali sought  reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. &#8216;Ali had not given the  oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet&#8217;s death and  Fatima&#8217;s death). &#8216;Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;Come to us, but let nobody  come with you,&#8221; as he disliked that &#8216;Umar should come, &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr),  &#8220;No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;What  do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them&#8217; So Abu Bakr entered upon  them, and then &#8216;Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;We know well your  superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah  has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we  thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  .&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thereupon Abu Bakr&#8217;s eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu  Bakr spoke, he said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the  relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own  relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I  will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or  regulation which I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will  follow.&#8221; On that &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;I promise to give you the oath of  allegiance in this after noon.&#8221; So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he  ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of &#8216;Ali and  his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had  offered; Then &#8216;Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud,  praised Abu Bakr&#8217;s right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of  jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. &#8216;Ali added,  &#8220;But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and  that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel  sorry.&#8221; On that all the Muslims became happy and said, &#8220;You have done the right  thing.&#8221; The Muslims then became friendly with &#8216;Ali as he returned to what the people  had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went out for the &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhal-Qa&#8217;da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to  conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days  only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote:  &#8220;This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The infidels said (to the Prophet), &#8220;We do not agree  with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented  you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Erase (the name of) &#8216;Apostle of Allah&#8217;.&#8221;  &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the writing sheet&#8230;and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got  it the following written! &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah, has concluded: &#8220;Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed  swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a  person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he  should not forbid him.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the  allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said &#8220;Tell your  companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished.&#8221; So  the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting &#8220;O  Uncle, O Uncle!&#8221; Ali took her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take the daughter  of your uncle.&#8221; So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) &#8216;Ali,  Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarreled about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I took her for she is the daughter  of my uncle.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my  wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my brother.&#8221; On that, the Prophet  gave her to her aunt and said, &#8220;The aunt is of the same status as the mother.&#8221;  He then said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;You are from me, and I am from you,&#8221; and said to Ja&#8217;far,  &#8220;You resemble me in appearance and character,&#8221; and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are  our brother and our freed slave.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said to the Prophet &#8216;Won&#8217;t you marry the  daughter of Hamza?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my foster  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

So the Prophet performed the  &#8216;Umra in the following year and according to the peace treaty, he entered Mecca, and when  he had stayed there for three days, the infidels ordered him to leave, and he left. </font></p>

The only cause  which prevented the Prophet from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was  that he pitied them. </font></p>

The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi  Balta&#8217;a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to do.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish  but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the  Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their  families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my  relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my  religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to his companions.&#8221; As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the  truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this  hypocrite!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. Hatib) has witnessed the Badr battle  (i.e. fought in it) and what could tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who witnessed  Badr and said, &#8220;O the people of Badr (i.e. Badr Muslim warriors), do what you like,  for I have forgiven you. &#8220;Then Allah revealed the Sura:&#8211; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out (towards Mecca) during the  year of the Conquest (of Mecca) and this news reached (the infidels of Quraish), Abu  Sufyan, Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqa came out to gather information about Allah&#8217;s  Apostle , They proceeded on their way till they reached a place called Marr-az-Zahran  (which is near Mecca). Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of  Arafat. Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;What is this? It looked like the fires of Arafat.&#8221;  Budail bin Warqa&#8217; said, &#8220;Banu &#8216;Amr are less in number than that.&#8221; Some of the  guards of Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw them and took them over, caught them and brought them to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet proceeded, he said to Al-Abbas, &#8220;Keep  Abu Sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the Muslims. So  Al-&#8216;Abbas kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes with the Prophet started  passing in front of Abu Sufyan in military batches. A batch passed and Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas Who are these?&#8221; &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;They are (Banu) Ghifar.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, I have got nothing to do with Ghifar.&#8221; Then (a batch of the tribe of)  Juhaina passed by and he said similarly as above. Then (a batch of the tribe of) Sad bin  Huzaim passed by and he said similarly as above. then (Banu) Sulaim passed by and he said  similarly as above. Then came a batch, the like of which Abu Sufyan had not seen. He said,  &#8220;Who are these?&#8221; Abbas said, &#8220;They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada,  the one holding the flag.&#8221; Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day  of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka&#8217;ba will be permissible.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan said., &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas! How excellent the day of destruction is! &#8220;Then came  another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair  bin Al Awwam. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Do you know what Sad bin &#8216;Ubada said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What  did he say?&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Sad told a lie, but today Allah will give superiority to the Ka&#8217;ba and today the  Ka&#8217;ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that his flag  be fixed at Al-Hajun. </font></p>

Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle  order you to fix the flag here?&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to  enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka&#8217;da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.

Allow me to tell you a statement which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the second day of the Conquest of Mecca. My two ears heard it and  my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it. He (i.e. the Prophet)  praised Allah and then said, &#8216;Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Allah and not by the  people, so it is not lawful for a person, who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed  blood in it, or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in Mecca  because Allah&#8217;s Apostle was allowed to fight in it, say to him; Allah permitted His  Apostle and did not allow you, and even he (i.e. the Apostle) was allowed for a short  period of the day, and today its (Mecca&#8217;s sanctity has become the same as it was before  (of old) so those who are present should inform those who are absent (this Hadith).&#8221;  Then Abu Shuraih, was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr say to you?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people,  and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, &#8220;What is wrong with the  people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, &#8220;That man  claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that  Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&#8221; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and  feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the &#8216;Arabs (other than Quraish)  delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.&#8221;  &#8220;Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a  true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and  my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father  returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &#8220;By Allah, I have come to you from  the Prophet for sure!&#8221; The Prophet afterwards said to them, &#8216;Offer such-and-such  prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of  you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows  Qur&#8217;an most should, lead the prayer.&#8221; So they looked for such a person and found none  who knew more Qur&#8217;an than I because of the Quranic material which I used to learn from the  caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a  boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very  short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t  you cover the anus of your reciter for us?&#8221; So they bought (a piece of cloth) and  made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that  shirt. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The boy is for the bed (i.e. for the owner of the bed where  he was born), and stone is for the adulterer.&#8221; (Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Huraira  used to say that (i.e. the last statement of the Prophet in the above Hadith 596,  publicly.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A lady committed theft during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle in the Ghazwa of Al-Fath, ((i.e. Conquest of Mecca). Her folk went to Usama bin  Zaid to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama interceded for her with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;Do you  intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by  Allah?&#8221; Usama said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; So  in the afternoon, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He  deserved and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because  if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them  stole, they would apply (Allah&#8217;s) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s  soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off.  Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;That lady  used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah&#8217;s Apostle </font></p>

The people of  Hawazin were good archers, and when we attacked them, they fled. But rushing towards the  booty, we were confronted by the arrows (of the enemy).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegate of Hawazin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  declaring their conversion to Islam and asked him to return their properties and captives,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and said to them, &#8220;There Is involved in this matter, the  people whom you see with me, and the most beloved talk to me, is the true one. So choose  one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for  you (i.e. have not distributed the booty).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had delayed the  distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta&#8217;if. So when they came  to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to return to them but one of the two, they  said, &#8220;We prefer to have our captives.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amongst the  Muslims, and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed! Your brothers have  come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever  of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to  his share till we give him from the very first booty which Allah will give us, then he can  do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We do that (i.e. return the captives) willingly as a  favor, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We do not know which of you  have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your  decision.&#8221; They went back and their chief&#8217;s spoke to them, and they (i.e. the chiefs)  returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him that all of them had agreed (to give up their  captives) with pleasure, and had given their permission (i.e. that the captives be  returned to their people).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the  battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the  Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans  over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his  armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as  if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed &#8216;Umar  and said to him, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the Order  of Allah.&#8221; Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after  overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Whoever had killed an Infidel and  has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g.  clothes, arms, horse, etc).&#8221; I (stood up) and said, &#8220;Who will be my  witness?&#8221; and then sat down. Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet  said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be my witness?&#8221;  and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet  said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?&#8221; So I narrated the whole story; A man said,  &#8220;Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please  compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No! By Allah, it will never  happen that the Prophet will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah and  His Apostle and give his spoils to you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken  the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!&#8221; So he gave it to me and I  bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the  first property I got after embracing Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qatada: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a  Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the  Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the  Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off.  That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then  he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims  (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with  them. Suddenly I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, &#8220;What  is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the order of Allah&#8221; Then the  people returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the  killed man.&#8221; So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an  infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came  to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. A man  from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, &#8220;The arms of the  deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate  him for it (i.e. the spoils),&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, Allah&#8217;s Apostle will not give  it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah&#8217;s Lions  who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and gave  that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got  after embracing Islam. </font></p>

The Prophet sent me with Abu  &#8216;Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and  fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, &#8220;O Uncle! Who shot you?&#8221; He pointed  me out (his killer) saying, &#8220;That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow).&#8221; So  I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and  started saying to him, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be ashamed? Won&#8217;t you stop?&#8221; So that person  stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu  &#8216;Amir. &#8220;Allah has killed your killer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take out this arrow&#8221;  So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, &#8220;O son of my  brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for me.&#8221; Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He  survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet  at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with  ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back  and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir&#8217;s news and how he had said  &#8220;Tell him to ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; The Prophet asked for water,  performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Forgive &#8216;Ubaid, Abu  Amir.&#8221; At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet&#8217;s armpits. The Prophet then  said, &#8220;O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many  of Your human creatures.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for  me?&#8221; (On that) the Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah, forgive the sins of &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;  Abu Burda said, &#8220;One of the prayers was for Abu &#8216;Amir and the other was for Abu Musa  (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais).&#8221; </font></p>

A  bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you fulfill what you have promised  me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Rejoice (at what I will do for you).&#8217; The bedouin said,  &#8220;(You have said to me) rejoice too often.&#8221; Then the Prophet turned to me (i.e.  Abu Musa) and Bilal in an angry mood and said, &#8216;The bedouin has refused the good tidings,  so you both accept them.&#8217; Bilal and I said, &#8216;We accept them.&#8217; Then the Prophet asked for a  drinking bowl containing water and washed his hands and face in it, and then took a  mouthful of water and threw it therein saying (to us), &#8220;Drink (some of) it and pour  (some) over your faces and chests and be happy at the good tidings.&#8221; So they both  took the drinking bowl and did as instructed. Um Salama called from behind a screen,  &#8220;Keep something (of the water for your mother.&#8221; So they left some of it for her.  </font></p>

He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle !

The Ansar said, &#8220;When there is a difficulty, we are  called, but the booty is given to other than us.&#8221; The news reached the Prophet and he  gathered them in a leather tent and said, &#8220;What is this news reaching me from you, O  the group of Ansar?&#8221; They kept silent, He added,&#8221; O the group of Ansar!

Saba&#8217;na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another).&#8221; Khalid kept on killing  (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen.  He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Facilitate things for the people and do not make things  difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard  on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to  carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near  (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once  Mu&#8217;adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his  companion Abu Musa. Mu&#8217;adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him  sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his  hands behind his neck. Mu&#8217;adh said to Abu Musa, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! What is  this?&#8221; Abu Musa replied. &#8220;This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing  Islam.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; Abu Musa  replied, &#8220;He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said,  &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed,  and he was killed. Then Mu&#8217;adh dismounted and said, &#8220;O Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do  you recite the Qur&#8217;an ?&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;I recite the Qur&#8217;an regularly at  intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu&#8217;adh?&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I sleep  in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for  my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me.

In our land there is an alcoholic drink (prepared)  from barley called Al-Mizr, and another (prepared) from honey, called Al-Bit&#8221;&#8216; The  Prophet said, &#8220;All intoxicants are prohibited.&#8221; Then both of them proceeded and  Mu&#8217;adh asked Abu Musa, &#8220;How do you recite the Quran?&#8221; Abu Musa replied, &#8220;I  recite it while I am standing, sitting or riding my riding animals, at intervals and  piecemeal.&#8221; Muadh said, &#8220;But I sleep and then get up. I sleep and hope for  Allah&#8217;s Reward for my sleep as I seek His Reward for my night prayer.&#8221; Then he (i.e.  Muadh) pitched a tent and they started visiting each other.

Shall I chop his  neck off?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, for he may offer prayers.&#8221; Khalid said,  &#8220;Numerous are those who offer prayers and say by their tongues (i.e. mouths) what is  not in their hearts.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have not been ordered (by Allah)  to search the hearts of the people or cut open their bellies.&#8221; Then the Prophet  looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was going away and said, &#8220;From the  offspring of this (man there will come out (people) who will recite the Qur&#8217;an  continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will neither  understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e. Islam) as an arrow  goes through a game&#8217;s body.&#8221; I think he also said, &#8220;If I should be present at  their time I would kill them as the nations a Thamud were killed.&#8221; </font></p>

I proceeded with one-hundred and-fifty cavalry  from Ahmas (tribe) who were horse riders. I used not to sit firm on horses, so the Prophet  stroke me over my chest till I saw the mark of his fingers over my chest, and then he  said, &#8216;O Allah! Make him (i.e. Jarir) firm and one who guides others and is guided on the  right path.&#8221; So Jarir proceeded to it dismantled and burnt it, and then sent a  messenger to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The messenger of Jarir said (to the Prophet), &#8220;By Him  Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave that place till it was like a scabby  camel.&#8221; The Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times. </font></p>

I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet of that,  and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he  said, O Allah! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).&#8217;  Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l&#8211;Khulasa was a house in Yemen  belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were  worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and  dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give  good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &#8220;The messenger of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your  neck.&#8221; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped  there and said to him, &#8220;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the  right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&#8221; So the man  broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah.  Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey  the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till  it was like a scabby camel.&#8221; Then the Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their  men five times. </font></p>

Dhu Amr said to me,  &#8220;If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has  died three days ago.&#8221; Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had  covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We  asked them and they said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed  as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.&#8217; Then they said, &#8220;Tell your friend  (Abu Bakr) that we have come (to visit him), and if Allah will, we will come again.&#8221;  So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr their statement, he said to me,  &#8220;I wish you had brought them (to me).&#8221; Afterwards I met Dhu Amr, and he said to  me, &#8220;O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e.  you, the nation of &#8216;Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint  another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of  the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and  will be delighted as kings get delighted.&#8221; </font></p>

We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food  ran short. So Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected,  and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our  daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that  we did not receive except a date each.&#8221; I asked (Jabir), &#8220;How could one date  benefit you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We came to know its value when even that finished.&#8221;  Jabir added, &#8220;Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small  mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida  ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a  she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching  them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us who were three-hundred riders under  the command of Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah in order to watch the caravan of the Quraish  pagans. We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger  that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and  because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal  (i.e. a fish) called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on  our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and  healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the  tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, &#8220;He  took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from  underneath it (without touching it). &#8221; Jabir added: There was a man amongst the  people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then  slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so. </font></p>

He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered  (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt  hungry again.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais  said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;But I was  forbidden (by Abu &#8216;Ubaida this time).&#8221; </font></p>

Um Salama replied, &#8216;I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of  these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at  that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet )  offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, &#8216;Stand beside him  and say (to him): Um Salama says, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Didn&#8217;t I hear you forbidding the  offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?&#8217; And if he  beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.&#8217; So the lady slave did that and the  Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished  his prayer, he said, &#8216;O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me  about these two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of &#8216;Abdul  Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat  which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me  offering) make up for those.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8220;What I told you, i.e. if you set  me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.&#8221; The Prophet left him till the  day after, when he said, &#8220;What have you got, O Thumama?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  got what I told you. &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Release Thumama.&#8221; So he  (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and  then entered the Mosque and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped  except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There  was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face  has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by  me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town  most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your  cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the &#8216;Umra. And now what  do you think?&#8221; The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him  to perform the &#8216;Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, &#8220;You have become  a Sabian?&#8221; Thumama replied, &#8220;No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad,  Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica  unless the Prophet gives his permission.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Musailima Al-Kadhdhab came during the lifetime of the  Prophet and started saying, &#8220;If Muhammad gives me the rule after him, I will follow  him.&#8221; And he came to Medina with a great number of the people of his tribe. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet )  stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him,  &#8220;If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah&#8217;s  Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this  religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown  to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my  behalf.&#8221; Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle : &#8220;You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,&#8221; and  Abu Huraira informed me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw (in a  dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired  Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles  flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would  appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to worship stones, and when we found a better stone  than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we could not  get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and then bring a sheep and milk  that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used  (to stop the military actions), calling this month the iron remover, for we used to remove  and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow in the month of Rajab. Abu Raja&#8217;  added: When the Prophet sent with (Allah&#8217;s) Message, I was a boy working as a shepherd of  my family camels. When we heard the news about the appearance of the Prophet, we ran to  the fire, i.e. to Musailima al-Kadhdhab. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in  Medina and stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of Al-Harith bin  Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir. There came to him  Allah&#8217;s Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet stopped before  Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, &#8220;If you wish, we would not  interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you&#8230;  The Prophet said, &#8220;If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I  think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin  Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf.&#8221; The Prophet then went away. I asked Ibn  Abbas about the dream Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned. Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Someone told me  that the Prophet said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw in a dream that two gold bangles  were put in my hands, and that frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed  to blow on them, and when I blew at them, both of them flew. Then I interpreted them as  two liars who would appear.&#8217; One of them was Al-&#8216;Ansi who was killed by Fairuz in Yemen  and the other was Musailima Al-Kadhdbab.&#8221; </font></p>

But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to  announce, &#8220;Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present  himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet had  said (to me), &#8220;If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and  so much,&#8221; repeating &#8220;so much&#8221; thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another  narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the  Prophet had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give  me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to  him, &#8220;I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give  me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or  else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you say, &#8216;You are like  a miserly to me?&#8217; There is no worse disease than miserliness.&#8221; Abu Bakr said it  thrice and added, &#8220;Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving  you.&#8221; (In another narration) Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (and  he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it  five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), &#8220;Take the same amount twice.&#8221; </font></p>

We, a group  of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin people went to the Prophet and asked him to give us something to ride,  but the Prophet refused. Then we asked him for the second time to give us something to  ride, but the Prophet took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride. After a  while, some camels of booty were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that five camels be  given to us. When we took those camels we said, &#8220;We have made the Prophet forget his  oath, and we will not be successful after that.&#8221; So I went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle ! You took an oath that you would not give us anything to ride, but  you have given us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for if I take an oath and later I see a  better solution than that, I act on the later (and gave the expiation of that oaths&#8221; </font></p>

The  Prophet said, &#8220;Did you assume the Ihram for Hajj?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He  said, &#8220;How did you express your intention (for performing Hajj)? &#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik (i.e. I am ready) to assume the Ihram with the same intention as that of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and  between Safa and Marwa, and then finish your Ihram.&#8221; So I performed the Tawaf around  the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then I came to a woman from the tribe of Qais who  removed the lice from my head. </font></p>

She asked, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s ordained obligation  (i.e. compulsory Hajj) enjoined on His slaves has become due on my old father who cannot  sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be sufficient if I perform the Hajj on his  behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) in the year of the Conquest  (of Mecca) while Usama was riding behind him on (his she-camel)&#8217;. Al-Qaswa.&#8217; Bilal and  &#8216;Uthman bin Talha were accompanying him. When he made his she-camel kneel down near the  Ka&#8217;ba, he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Get us the key (of the Ka&#8217;ba). He brought the key to him  and opened the gate (of the Ka&#8217;ba), for him. The Prophet, Usama, Bilal and &#8216;Uthman (bin  Talha) entered the Ka&#8217;ba and then closed the gate behind them (from inside). The Prophet  stayed there for a long period and then came out. The people rushed to get in, but I went  in before them and found Bilal standing behind the gate, and I said to him, &#8220;Where  did the Prophet pray?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He prayed between those two front  pillars.&#8221; The Ka&#8217;ba was built on six pillars, arranged in two rows, and he prayed  between the two pillars of the front row leaving the gate of the Ka&#8217;ba at his back and  facing (in prayer) the wall which faces one when one enters the Ka&#8217;ba. Between him and  that wall (was the distance of about three cubits). But I forgot to ask Bilal about the  number of Rakat the Prophet had prayed. There was a red piece of marble at the place where  he (i.e. the Prophet) had offered the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were talking about Hajjat-ul-Wada, while the Prophet was  amongst us. We did not know what Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; signified. The Prophet praised Allah and  then mentioned Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal and described him extensively, saying, &#8220;Allah did  not send any prophet but that prophet warned his nation of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. Noah and  the prophets following him warned (their people) of him. He will appear amongst you (O  Muhammad&#8217;s followers), and if it happens that some of his qualities may be hidden from  you, but your Lord&#8217;s State is clear to you and not hidden from you. The Prophet said it  thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in  the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Allah has  made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of  yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours.&#8221; The Prophet added: No doubt!  Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; The  Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has taken its original shape  which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is of twelve months,  four of which are sacred, and out of these (four) three are in succession, i.e.  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab which is named after the  Mudar tribe, between (the month of) Jumaida (ath-thania) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; Then the  Prophet asked, &#8220;Which is this month?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; On that the Prophet kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it  with another name. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We  replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; &#8220;We replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; On that he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the town of  Mecca?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, &#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which day is today?&#8221;  We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of  An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So your blood,  your properties, (The sub-narrator Muhammad said, &#8216;I think the Prophet also said: And your  honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of  yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you  about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one  another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to  those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will  understand it better than those who have actually heard it.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Muhammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, &#8220;Muhammad spoke the  truth!&#8221;) He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed  (Allah&#8217;s Message) to you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet visited me during Hajjat ul-Wada&#8217; while I was  suffering from a disease which brought me to the verge of death. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! My ailment has reached such a (bad) state as you see, and I have much wealth, but  I have no-one to inherit from me except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property  as alms (in charity)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Shall I give  half of my property as alms?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;(Shall I give)  1/3 of it? &#8221; He replied, &#8221; 1/3, and even 1/3 is too much. It is better for you  to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging people (for their  sustenance); and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s Sake, you will get reward for it even for  the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to  Medina)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you remain behind, any good deed which you will  do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that  some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you.&#8221;  The Prophet then added, &#8220;O Allah! Complete the Migration of my companions and do not  turn them on their heels. But the poor Sad bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sad) (died  in Mecca) .&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle pitied Sad for he died in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My Companions sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him for  some animals to ride on as they were accompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was  the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! My companions have sent me  to you to provide them with means of transportation.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah! I will  not make you ride anything.&#8221; It happened that when I reached him, he was in an angry  mood, and I didn&#8217;t notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the  Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become &#8216;angry with me. So I returned  to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had  passed when I heard Bilal calling, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!&#8221; I replied to his  call. Bilal said, &#8220;Respond to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is calling you.&#8221; When I went  to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, &#8220;Take these two camels tied together and also  these two camels tied together,&#8221;&#8216; referring to six camels he had brought them from  Sad at that time. The Prophet added, &#8220;Take them to your companions and say, &#8216;Allah  (or Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) allows you to ride on these,&#8217; so ride on them.&#8221; So I took those  camels to them and said, &#8220;The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels) but by  Allah, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to somebody who heard the  statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Allah&#8217;s  Apostle has not said.&#8221; They said to me, &#8220;We consider you truthful, and we will  do what you like.&#8221; The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of  them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle wherein he  denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same.  So these people told them the same information as Abu Musa had told them. </font></p>

So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter&#8217;s claim as invalid (i.e.  the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet said, &#8220;Should  he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a  male camel to snap it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he  became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which  he failed to take part. Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any  Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa  of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them  (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of  Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not  exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the  people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had  never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that  Ghazwa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then  at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to  hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of  that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long  journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims  clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he  informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied  by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221;  Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would  remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle  fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in  order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would  say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the  people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had  not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure)  one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure,  I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next  morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the  battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had  done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I  went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I  could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah  had excused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was  sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his  looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you  have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle kept silent.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the  Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of  false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the  advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle,  had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I  could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly  to speak the truth. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned  from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer  therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who  had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and  taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the  excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and  when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I  came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had  you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other  than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking  fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek  your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell  you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.  Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or  wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards  this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up,  and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you  doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the  others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to  forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so  much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie,  but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of  them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied,  Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me  two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an  example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all  those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they  changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to  me as if I did not know it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards  my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest  of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with  the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and  I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not.  Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with  my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would  turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked  till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to  me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,  &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He  kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I  asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it  better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the  wall.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw  a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in  Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out  for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the  following was written: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend  (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a  place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console  you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a  test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When  forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her  and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said  to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this  matter.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on  him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he  should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah,  he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you  also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife  of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked  him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217; Then I remained in that state for  ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the  time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the  Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting  in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened  to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the  voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab  bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah,  realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our  repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to  congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman  came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and  his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came  to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by  Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and  wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating  me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s  Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I  saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came  to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e.  Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for  Talha.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright  with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother  delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you  or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy,  his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of  him. When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my  repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has  saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth  as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped  fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from  telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin  (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and  deed).&#8221; (9.117-119) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His  guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for  Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to  anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you  when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the  rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed  altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He  took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left  our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to  the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our  failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by  the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before  him and he excused them by accepting their excuses. </font></p>

Al-Mughira  added. &#8220;The Prophet washed his face, and when he wanted to wash his forearms, the  sleeves of his cloak became tight over them, so he took them out from underneath the cloak  and then he washed them (i.e. his forearms) and passed wet hands over his Khuffs.&#8221; </font></p>

Some  said, &#8220;What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask  him ( to understand his state ).&#8221; So they went to the Prophet and asked him again.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me  for.&#8221; Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of  the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen  me dealing with them.&#8221; (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn Abbas kept  quiet as rewards the third order, or he said, &#8220;I forgot it.&#8221;) (See Hadith No.  116 Vol. 1) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Book is  sufficient for us.&#8217; So the people in the house differed and started disputing. Some of  them said, &#8216;Give him writing material so that he may write for you something after which  you will not go astray.&#8217; while the others said the other way round. So when their talk and  differences increased, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Get up.&#8221; Ibn Abbas used to say,  &#8220;No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah &#8216;s Apostle was in good health, he used to say,  &#8220;Never does a prophet die unless he is shown his place in Paradise ( before his death  ), and then he is made alive or given option.&#8221; When the Prophet became ill and his  last moments came while his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious, and when he came  to his senses, he looked towards the roof of the house and then said, &#8220;O Allah!  (Please let me be) with the highest companion.&#8221; Thereupon I said, &#8220;Hence he is  not going to stay with us? &#8221; Then I came to know that his state was the confirmation  of the narration he used to mention to us while he was in good health. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at it, so I took the Siwak, cut it  (chewed it with my teeth), shook it and made it soft (with water), and then gave it to the  Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it. I had never seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle cleaning his teeth  in a better way. After finishing the brushing of his teeth, he lifted his hand or his  finger and said thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Let me be with the highest companions,&#8221; and  then died. &#8216;Aisha used to say, &#8220;He died while his head was resting between my chest  and chin.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;When the ailment of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle became aggravated, he requested his wives to permit him to be (treated) nursed in  my house, and they gave him permission. He came out (to my house), walking between two men  with his feet dragging on the ground, between &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul&#8211;Muttalib and another  man&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Abdullah of what &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Abbas said to me, &#8216;Do you know who is the other man whom &#8216;Aisha did not name?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;No.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;It was &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet  used to narrate saying, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered my house and his disease became  aggravated, he said, &#8221; Pour on me the water of seven water skins, the mouths of which  have not been untied, so that I may give advice to the people.&#8217; So we let him sit in a big  basin belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and then started to pour water on him  from these water skins till he started pointing to us with his hands intending to say,  &#8216;You have done your job.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Then he went out to the people and led  them in prayer and preached to them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle became ill seriously, he started covering his face with his  woolen sheet, and when he felt short of breath, he removed it from hi; face and said,  &#8216;That is so! Allah&#8217;s (curse be on the Jews and the Christians, as they took the graves of  their prophets as (places of worship),&#8217; intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had  done.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I argued with Allah&#8217;s Apostle repeatedly about that matter  (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer in his place when he was  ill), and what made me argue so much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after  the Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place, and I felt that  anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen to the people, so I wanted Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to give up the idea of choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. Ali)! How is the  health of Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali replied, &#8220;He has recovered with  the Grace of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him,  &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the  offspring of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as  to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new  ruler to take care of us.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for  it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after  that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer on Monday  and Abu Bakr was leading them in prayer, suddenly Allah&#8217;s Apostle lifted the curtain of  &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling and looked at them while they were in the rows of the prayers and  smiled. Abu Bakr retreated to join the row, thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come  out for the prayer. The Muslims were about to be put to trial in their prayer (i.e. were  about to give up praying) because of being overjoyed at seeing Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned them with his hand to complete their prayer and then entered the  dwelling and let fall the curtain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was one of the favors of Allah towards me that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest  and Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman entered upon me  with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle (against my  chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak,  so I said ( to him ), &#8220;Shall I take it for you ? &#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I  took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, &#8220;Shall I soften it for you  ?&#8221; He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it. In  front of him there was a jug or a tin, (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Umar is in doubt as to which  was right) containing water. He started dipping his hand in the water and rubbing his face  with it, he said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Death has its  agonies.&#8221; He then lifted his hands (towards the sky) and started saying, &#8220;With  the highest companion,&#8221; till he expired and his hand dropped down. </font></p>

Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221;, seeking &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  turn. His wives allowed him to stay wherever he wished. So he stayed at &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house  till he expired while he was with her.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;The Prophet expired on  the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my  chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu  Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at  it and I said to him, &#8216;O &#8216;AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.&#8217; So he gave it to me and I cut  it, chewed it (it&#8217;s end) and gave it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who cleaned his teeth with it  while he was resting against my chest.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet expired in my house and on the day of my turn,  leaning against my chest. One of us (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s wives ) used to recite a prayer  asking Allah to protect him from all evils when he became sick. So I started asking Allah  to protect him from all evils (by reciting a prayer ). He raised his head towards the sky  and said, &#8220;With the highest companions, with the highest companions.&#8221;  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr passed carrying a fresh leaf-stalk of a date-palm and the  Prophet looked at it and I thought that the Prophet was in need of it (for cleaning his  teeth ). So I took it (from &#8216;Abdur Rahman) and chewed its head and shook it and gave it to  the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it, in the best way he had ever cleaned his teeth,  and then he gave it to me, and suddenly his hand dropped down or it fell from his hand  (i.e. he expired). So Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva on his last day on earth  and his first day in the Hereafter. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh on a horse. He  dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon  &#8216;Aisha and went straight to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind  of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet&#8217;s face and bowed over him and kissed him  and wept, saying, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah  will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come  upon you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Abu Bakr went out while Umar bin  Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Sit down, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But  &#8216;Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad , then Muhammad is dead,  but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.  Allah said:&#8211;&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have  passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )&#8230;&#8230;Allah will reward to those who  are thankful.&#8221; (3.144) By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had  revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from  him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: Said bin Al-Musaiyab told me that &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and  I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had  died.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ghailan bin Jarir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas, &#8220;Tell me about the name &#8216;Al-Ansar.; Did  you call yourselves by it or did Allah call you by it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah called  us by it.&#8221; We used to visit Anas (at Basra) and he used to narrate to us the virtues  and deeds of the Ansar, and he used to address me or a person from the tribe of Al-Azd and  say, &#8220;Your tribe did so-and-so on such-and-such a day.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.121"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The day of Bu&#8217;ath (i.e. Day of fighting between the two  tribes of the Ansar, the Aus and Khazraj) was brought about by Allah for the good of His  Apostle so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached (Medina), the tribes of Medina had already  divided and their chiefs had been killed and wounded. So Allah had brought about the  battle for the good of H is Apostle in order that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace  Islam. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.122"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 122: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the Conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet had  given (from the booty) the Quraish, the Ansar said, &#8220;By Allah, this is indeed very  strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish, our war booty are  distributed amongst them.&#8221; When this news reached the Prophet he called the Ansar and  said, &#8220;What is this news that has reached me from you?&#8221; They used not to tell  lies, so they replied, &#8220;What has reached you is true.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it  please you that the people take the booty to their homes and you take Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  your homes? If the Ansar took their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take  the Ansar&#8217;s valley or a mountain pass.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 123: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet or Abul-Qasim said, &#8220;If the Ansar took  their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take Ansar&#8217;s valley. And but for  the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar.&#8221; Abu Huraira used to say,  &#8220;The Prophet is not unjust (by saying so). May my parents be sacrificed for him, for  the Ansar sheltered and helped him,&#8221; or said a similar sentence. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.124"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 124: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the emigrants reached Medina. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established the bond of fraternity between &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Sad bin Ar-Rabi. Sad said to  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I am the richest of all the Ansar, so I want to divide my property  (between us), and I have two wives, so see which of the two you like and tell me, so that  I may divorce her, and when she finishes her prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce,  then marry her.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless your family and property  for you; where is your market?&#8221; So they showed him the Qainuqa&#8217; market. (He went  there and) returned with a profit in the form of dried yogurt and butter. He continued  going (to the market) till one day he came, bearing the traces of yellow scent. The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this (scent)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married.&#8221;  The Prophet asked, &#8220;How much Mahr did you give her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I gave  her a date-stone of gold or a gold piece equal to the weight of a date-stone.&#8221; (The  narrator, Ibrahim, is in doubt as to which is correct.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 125: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  made a bond of fraternity between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; who was a rich man, Sad said,  &#8220;The Ansar know that I am the richest of all of them, so I will divide my property  into two parts between me and you, and I have two wives; see which of the two you like so  that I may divorce her and you can marry her after she becomes lawful to you by her  passing the prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce. &#8216;Abdur Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah  bless you your family (i.e. wives) for you.&#8221; (But &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market)  and did not return on that day except with some gain of dried yogurt and butter. He went  on trading just a few days till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle bearing the traces of yellow  scent over his clothes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked him, &#8220;What is this scent?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;I have married a woman from the Ansar.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;How much Mahr have you given?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A date-stone weight of gold or a  golden date-stone.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Arrange a marriage banquet even with a  sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 126: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please divide the  date-palm trees between us and them (i.e. emigrants).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; The Ansar said, &#8220;Let them (i.e. the emigrants) do the labor for us in  the gardens and share the date-fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We accepted  this.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 127: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying (or the Prophet said),  &#8220;None loves the Ansar but a believer, and none hates them but a hypocrite. So Allah  will love him who loves them, and He will hate him who hates them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sign of Belief is to love the  Ansar, and the sign of hypocrisy is to hate the Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.129"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 129: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet saw the women and children (of the Ansar)  coming forward. (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think that Anas said, &#8216;They were returning  from a wedding party.&#8221;) The Prophet stood up and said thrice, &#8220;By Allah! You are  from the most beloved people to me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once an Ansari woman, accompanied by a son of hers, came to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle spoke to her and said twice, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand  my life is, you are the most beloved people to me.&#8221; </font></p>

Then both of them pretended to be eating,  but they really went to bed hungry.

The Prophet  came out, tying his head with a piece of the hem of a sheet. He ascended the pulpit which  he never ascended after that day. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, &#8220;I  request you to take care of the Ansar as they are my near companions to whom I confided my  private secrets.

The people will go on increasing, but the Ansar will go on decreasing till they  become just like salt in a meal.

Let my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please  don&#8217;t raise your head and make it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let  my neck and chest be wounded instead of yours.&#8221; (On that day) I saw &#8216;Aisha, the  daughter of Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so that I was able to see  the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water skins of their arms to pour  the water into the mouths of the thirsty people and then go back and fill them and come to  pour the water into the mouths of the people again.

In the lifetime of the Prophet I had a dream which I  narrated to him. I saw as if I were in a garden.&#8221; He then described its extension and  greenery. He added: In its center there was an iron pillar whose lower end was fixed in  the earth and the upper end was in the sky, and at its upper end there was a (ring-shaped)  hand-hold.

Then I got hold of the hand-hold, and I was told to hold it tightly, then I woke  up and (the effect of) the hand-hold was in my hand. I narrated al I that to the Prophet  who said, &#8216;The garden is Islam, and the hand-hold is the Most Truth-worthy Hand-Hold. So  you will remain as a Muslim till you die.&#8221; The narrator added: &#8220;The man was  &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha: I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the  Prophet as much as I did of Khadija (although) she died before he married me, for I often  heard him mentioning her, and Allah had told him to give her the good tidings that she  would have a palace of Qasab (i.e. pipes of precious stones and pearls in Paradise), and  whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would send her women-friends a good share of it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not feel jealous of any woman as much as I did of  Khadija because Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to mention her very often.

When I sometimes said to him, &#8220;(You treat Khadija in  such a way) as if there is no woman on earth except Khadija,&#8221; he would say,  &#8220;Khadija was such-and-such, and from her I had children.&#8221; </font></p>

Hala!&#8221; So I became jealous and said, &#8220;What makes you remember an old woman  amongst the old women of Quraish an old woman (with a teethless mouth) of red gums who  died long ago, and in whose place Allah has given you somebody better than her?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet met Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of  (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was  presented to the Prophet but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid)  who said, &#8220;I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols.  I eat none but those things on which Allah&#8217;s Name has been mentioned at the time of  slaughtering.&#8221; Zaid bin &#8216;Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter  their animals, and used to say, &#8220;Allah has created the sheep and He has sent the  water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you  slaughter it in other than the Name of Allah. He used to say so, for he rejected that  practice and considered it as something abominable. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail went to Sham,  inquiring about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him  about their religion. He said, &#8220;I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me some  thing about it.&#8221; The Jew said, &#8220;You will not embrace our religion unless you  receive your share of Allah&#8217;s Anger.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;&#8216;I do not run except from  Allah&#8217;s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you  tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know any other religion  except the Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is Hanif?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hanif is  the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used  to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious  scholar and told him the same as before. The Christian said, &#8220;You will not embrace  our religion unless you get a share of Allah&#8217;s Curse.&#8221; Zaid replied, &#8220;I do not  run except from Allah&#8217;s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allah&#8217;s Curse and His Anger if  I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;I do not know any other religion except Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is  Hanif?&#8221; He replied, Hanif is the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a  Jew nor a Christian and he used to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; When Zaid heard  their Statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out,  he raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make You my Witness that I am on the  religion of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma bint Abi Bakr: I saw Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail  standing with his back against the Ka&#8217;ba and saying, &#8220;O people of Quraish! By Allah,  none amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me.&#8221; He used to preserve the  lives of little girls: If somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him,  &#8220;Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; So he would take her, and  when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, &#8220;Now if you want her, I will  give her to you, and if you wish, I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

So she spoke and said, &#8220;Who are  you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A man from the Emigrants.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;Which  Emigrants?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;From Quraish.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;From what branch  of Quraish are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You ask too many questions; I am Abu Bakr.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;How long shall we enjoy this good order (i.e. Islamic religion) which  Allah has brought after the period of ignorance?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You will enjoy it as  long as your Imams keep on abiding by its rules and regulations.&#8221; She asked,  &#8220;What are the Imams?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were there not heads and chiefs of your  nation who used to order the people and they used to obey them?&#8221; She said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So they (i.e. the Imams) are those whom I meant.&#8221; </font></p>

They (i.e. my masters) accused me of  stealing it and they tortured me to such an extent that they even looked for it in my  private parts. So, while they all were around me, and I was in my great distress, suddenly  the kite came over our heads and threw the scarf, and they took it. I said to them &#8216;This  is what you accused me of stealing, though I was innocent.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first event of Qasama in the pre-lslamic period of  ignorance was practiced by us (i.e. Banu Hashim). A man from Banu Hashim was employed by a  Quraishi man from another branch-family. The (Hashimi) laborer set out with the Quraishi  driving his camels. There passed by him another man from Banu Hashim. The leather rope of  the latter&#8217;s bag had broken so he said to the laborer, &#8220;Will you help me by giving me  a rope in order to tie the handle of my bag lest the camels should run away from me?&#8221;  The laborer gave him a rope and the latter tied his bag with it. When the caravan halted,  all the camels&#8217; legs were tied with their fetters except one camel. The employer asked the  laborer, &#8220;Why, from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;There is no fetter for it.&#8221; The Quraishi asked, &#8220;Where is its  fetter?&#8221; and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death (later on Just before  his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The laborer asked (him), &#8220;Will you go for  the pilgrimage?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I  will attend it.&#8221; The (Hashimi) laborer said, &#8220;Will you please convey a message  for me once in your life?&#8221; The other man said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; The laborer wrote:  &#8216;When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you,  call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell  him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter.&#8221; Then the laborer expired. When the  employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, &#8220;What has happened to our  companion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died)  and I buried him.&#8221; Then Abu Talib said, &#8220;The deceased deserved this from  you.&#8221; After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the  message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, &#8220;O the family of  Quraish!&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is Quraish.&#8221; Then he called, &#8220;O  the family of Banu Hashim!&#8221; Again the people replied, &#8220;This is Banu  Hashim.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Who is Abu Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is  Abu Talib.&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that  so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel).&#8221; Then Abu Talib went to the  (Quraishi) killer and said to him, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you  wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you  wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and  if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas.&#8221; The killer went to his  people and they said, &#8220;We will take an oath.&#8221; Then a woman from Banu Hashim who  was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him,  came to Abu Talib and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty  men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the  oath-taking is carried on.&#8221; Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came  (to Abu Talib) and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead  of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he  does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and  excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him.  Then 48 men came and took the oath. Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said:) By Him in Whose Hand my life  is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons remained alive. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah caused the day of Buath to take place before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was sent (as an Apostle) so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, those people  had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So  Allah made that day precede Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace  Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: To run along the valley between two  green pillars of Safa and Marwa (mountains) was not Sunna, but the people in the  pre-islamic period of ignorance used to run along it, and used to say: &#8220;We do not  cross this rain stream except running strongly. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I came to the Prophet while he was leaning against his  sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba. We were suffering greatly from the pagans in those  days. i said (to him). &#8220;Will you invoke Allah (to help us)?&#8221; He sat down with a  red face and said, &#8220;(A believer among) those who were before you used to be combed  with iron combs so that nothing of his flesh or nerves would remain on his bones; yet that  would never make him desert his religion. A saw might be put over the parting of his head  which would be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his  religion. Allah will surely complete this religion (i.e. Islam) so that a traveler from  Sana to Hadra-maut will not be afraid of anybody except Allah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Baiyan added, &#8220;Or the wolf, lest it should harm his sheep.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was prostrating, surrounded by some of  Quraish, &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait brought the intestines (i.e. abdominal contents) of a camel  and put them over the back of the Prophet. The Prophet did not raise his head, (till)  Fatima, came and took it off his back and cursed the one who had done the harm. The  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, &#8216;Utba bin  Rabi&#8217;al, Shaba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Umaiya bin Khalaf or Ubai bin Khalaf.&#8221; (The sub-narrator  Shu&#8217;ba, is not sure of the last name.)

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;AbdurRahman bin Abza said, &#8220;Ask Ibn &#8216;Abbas about  these two Qur&#8217;anic Verses: &#8216;Nor kill such life as Allah has made sacred, Except for just  cause.&#8217; (25.168) &#8220;And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.  (4.93) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So I asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said, &#8220;When the Verse that  is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, &#8216;But we have slain such life  as Allah has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Allah, and we have  also committed fornication.&#8217; So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Except those who repent, believe, and  do good&#8211; (25.70) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the  Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its  laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire  forever.&#8221; Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, &#8220;Except the one who regrets  (one&#8217;s crime) . &#8221; </font></p>

Abu Bakr came and caught him by his shoulder and pushed  him away from the Prophet and said, &#8220;Do you want to kill a man just because he says,  &#8216;My Lord is Allah?&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

When he finished, I walked with him and asked, &#8220;What about the bone  and the animal dung?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of  Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me&#8211;and how nice those Jinns were&#8211;and asked me for  the remains of the human food. I invoked Allah for them that they would never pass by a  bone or animal dung but find food on them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the  Prophet he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out  the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven.  Listen to what he says and come back to me.&#8221; So his brother set out and came to the  Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him.  &#8220;I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not  poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said, &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; He  then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing some water till be  reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not  know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away,  &#8216;Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw &#8216;Ali, he followed him,  and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took  his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long  without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his  retiring place. &#8216;Ali passed by him and said, &#8220;Has the man not known his dwelling  place yet?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the  other about anything. When it was the third day. &#8216;Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed  with him. Then &#8216;Ali said &#8220;Will you tell me what has brought you here?&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell  you.&#8221; &#8216;Ali promised him, and he informed &#8216;Ali about the matter. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It  is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and  if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me  and enter the place which I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhar did so, and followed &#8216;Ali till he  entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some  of the Prophet&#8217;s talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go  back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst  them (i.e. the pagans).&#8221; So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as  loudly as possible, &#8220;I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except  Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The People got up and beat him  painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the  people), &#8220;Woe to you! Don&#8217;t you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and  your trade to Sha&#8217;m is through their way?&#8221; So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar  again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again  Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him). </font></p>

He said, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;We want Ibn Al-Khattab who has embraced Islam.&#8221; Al-&#8216;As said, &#8220;There is no  way for anybody to touch him.&#8221; So the people retreated. </font></p>

Call the man  to me.&#8221; When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought.

An  (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was  crying, &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has  the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).&#8217; On that the people fled, but I said, &#8216;I  shall not go away till I know what is behind this.&#8217; Then the cry came again: &#8216;O you bold  evil-doer!

They said, &#8216;You  have done your duty.&#8217; So while I was sitting with them. &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s Messenger came to me.  They said, &#8216;Allah has put you to trial.&#8221; I set out and when I reached &#8216;Uthman, he  said, &#8216;What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?&#8217; I recited Tashahhud and  added, &#8216;Allah has sent Muhammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Quran) to him. You (O  Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and had  faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina),  and you enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now  the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on  him the legal punishment.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then said to me, &#8216;O my nephew! Did you ever meet  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the  virgin in her seclusion.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then recited Tashahhud and said, &#8216;No doubt, Allah has  sent Muhammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Quran) and I was  amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and I had faith in  Muhammad&#8217;s Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I  enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah,  I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then Allah made  Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then  &#8216;Umar became Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him.  Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Uthman further said, &#8216;The what are these talks which are  reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqb; Allah willing,  I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged  fort lashes. He ordered &#8216;Ali to flog him an he himself flogged him as well.&#8221; </font></p>

We used to greet you in the past and you used to reply to  us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily The Mind is occupied and busy with more important matter  during the prayer.&#8221; (So one cannot return One&#8217;s greetings.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Talib was in his death bed, the Prophet went to  him while Abu Jahl was sitting beside him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my uncle! Say: None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah, an expression I will defend your case with,  before Allah.&#8221; Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Umaya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Will you  leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; So they kept on saying this to him so that  the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: &#8220;I am on the religion of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8221; I will keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s  Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then the following Verse was  revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;It is not fitting for the Prophet and the believers  to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the pagans, even if they were their near relatives, after  it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; (9.113) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle described to them  his Night Journey saying, &#8220;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone  came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&#8221; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my  side, &#8220;What does he mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It means from his throat to his pubic  area,&#8221; or said, &#8220;From the top of the chest.&#8221; The Prophet further said,  &#8220;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart  was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a  white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to  me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e.  Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide  that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried  on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &#8216;Who  is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel  replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has Muhammad been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate  was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me).  &#8216;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the  greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel  ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be  opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent  visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e.  John) and &#8216;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;These  are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted them and both of them returned  my greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then  Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was  asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217;  Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate  was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to  me), &#8216;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the  greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then  Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was  asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217;  Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth  heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&#8217;  So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious  brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked  for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was  asked. &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been  called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an  excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e.  Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and  he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be  opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit  his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses.  Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he  returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217;  Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose  followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended  with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is  it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied,  &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then  it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw  Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&#8217; So I  greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son  and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of  the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near  Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the  Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and  two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217;  As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to  me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were  brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you  and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty  prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been  ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said,  &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before  you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and  ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten  prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said  before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back  to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a  day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and  was ordered to observe five prayers a day. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been  ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your  followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the  people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your  Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so  much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s  Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the  burden of My Worshipers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who had taken part in the battle of Badr with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and had been amongst his companions on the night of Al-&#8216;Aqaba Pledge: Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, surrounded by a group of his companions said, &#8220;Come along and give me the  pledge of allegiance that you will not worship anything besides Allah, will not steal,  will not commit illegal sexual intercourse will not kill your children, will not utter;  slander, invented by yourself, and will not disobey me if I order you to do something  good. Whoever among you will respect and fulfill this pledge, will be rewarded by Allah.  And if one of you commits any of these sins and is punished in this world then that will  be his expiation for it, and if one of you commits any of these sins and Allah screens his  sin, then his matter, will rest with Allah: If He will, He will punish him and if He  will,. He will excuse him.&#8221; So I gave the pledge of allegiance to him for these  conditions. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We  went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my  hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I  was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not  knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the  door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took  some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in  the house I saw some Ansari women who said, &#8220;Best wishes and Allah&#8217;s Blessing and a  good luck.&#8221; Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage).  Unexpectedly Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to  him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. </font></p>

Some of us passed  away without taking anything of their rewards (in this world) and one of them was Mus&#8217;ab  bin &#8216;Umar who was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud leaving a striped woolen  cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and when covered his feet,  his head became naked. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to cover his head and put  some Idhkhir (i.e. a special kind of grass) on his feet. (On the other hand) some of us  have had their fruits ripened (in this world) and they are collecting them.&#8221; </font></p>

A believer used to run away with his religion to Allah and His Apostle lest he  should be put to trial because of his religion. Today Allah has made Islam triumphant, and  today a believer can worship his Lord wherever he likes. But the deeds that are still  rewardable (in place of emigration) are Jihad and good intentions.&#8221; (See Hadith No.  42 Vol. 4). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat on the pulpit and said, &#8220;Allah has  given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly  life whatever he likes or to accept the good (of the Hereafter) which is with Allah. So he  has chosen that good which is with Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr wept and said, &#8220;Our  fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you.&#8221; We became astonished at this. The people  said, &#8220;Look at this old man! Allah&#8217;s Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He  has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which  is with Him, while he says. &#8216;our fathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you.&#8221; But it  was Allah&#8217;s Apostle who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than we.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else  regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my  followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is.  sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu  Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.245"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 245: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents  believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don&#8217;t  remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the morning  and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu  Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn  Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Where are  you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;My people have turned me out (of my country), so  I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina said, &#8220;O Abu  Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because  you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and  kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken  persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In  the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. &#8220;A man  like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e.  Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations  with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the  calamity-stricken persons?&#8221; So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn  Ad-Daghina&#8217;s protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, &#8220;Let Abu Bakr worship his  Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt  us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our  women and children.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in  that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite  Quran outside his house. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in  front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children  of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and  look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping  on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they  sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, &#8220;We accepted your  protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he  has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays  and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and  children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his  Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to  release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with  you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina  went to Abu- Bakr and said, (&#8220;O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on  your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of  protecting you, because I do not want the &#8216;Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a  contract I have made on behalf of another man.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;I release you  from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the  Muslims, &#8220;In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm  trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.&#8221; So, some people migrated to  Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia,  returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  to him, &#8220;Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate  also.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed  for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the  leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr&#8217;s house at noon,  someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;This is Allah&#8217;s Apostle with his head covered coming at a  time at which he never used to visit us before.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;May my parents  be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great  necessity.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed  to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. &#8220;Tell everyone who is present with  you to go away.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;There are none but your family. May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;i have been  given permission to migrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Shall I accompany you? May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for  you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;(I  will accept it) with payment.&#8221; So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some  journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr&#8217;s daughter, cut a piece from her  waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was  named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the  mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was  intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave  them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent  the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became  dark he would (go and) inform them of it. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr,  used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after  nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the  milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. &#8216;Amir  bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did  the same in each of those three nights. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from  the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he  was in alliance with the family of Al-&#8216;As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of  the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two  she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain  of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), &#8216;Amir bin  Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham said that his father  informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham saying, &#8220;The messengers of the heathens  of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or  arrest Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was  sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and  stood up while we were sitting, and said, &#8220;O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some  people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.&#8221;  Suraqa added, &#8220;I too realized that it must have been they. But I said &#8216;No, it is not  they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.&#8217; I stayed in the  gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to  get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house  dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my  horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr),  my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took  out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet  and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and  let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of  the Quran by Allah&#8217;s Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing  it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I  fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs  from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up  in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which  I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted  my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came  to my mind that the cause of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I  said to him, &#8220;Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your  head.&#8221; Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them.  Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did  not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, &#8220;Do not tell others about us.&#8221; Then  I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered &#8216;Amr bin  Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on his way.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah&#8217;s Apostle met Az-Zubair  in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news  of the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the  Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to  return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went  into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for  some thing, and he saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes,  emerging out of the desert mirage. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice,  &#8220;O you &#8216;Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!&#8221; So all  the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the summit of Harra. The  Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf,  and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the  people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had  not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the  people came to know Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed with Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf for  ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the  people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle at  Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for  drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship  of &#8216;Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This  place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then called the two  boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque.  The two boys said, &#8220;No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt  bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying &#8220;This load is better than  the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better  rewardable.&#8221; He was also saying, &#8220;O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in  the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.&#8221; Thus the Prophet  recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Ibn Shibab said, &#8220;In the Hadiths it does not occur  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.&#8221;)  </font></p>

Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt  thirsty and he passed by a shepherd. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I took a bowl and milked a  little milk in it and brought it to the Prophet and he drank till I was pleased.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair. She added,  &#8220;I migrated to Medina while I was at full term of pregnancy and alighted at Quba  where I gave birth to him. Then I brought him to the Prophet and put him in his lap. The  Prophet asked for a date, chewed it, and put some of its juice in the child&#8217;s mouth. So,  the first thing that entered the child&#8217;s stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then  the Prophet rubbed the child&#8217;s palate with a date and invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings on  him, and he was the first child born amongst the Emigrants in the Islamic Land (i.e.  Medina). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding  behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day,  &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?&#8221; Abu Bakr would say, &#8220;This  man shows me the Way,&#8221; One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact,  Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a  horse-rider persuing them. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a horse-rider  persuing us.&#8221; The Prophet looked behind and said, &#8220;O Allah! Cause him to fall  down.&#8221; So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Order me whatever you want.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.&#8221; So, in the first part  of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah&#8217;s Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a  protector. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to  the Ansar, and they came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they  said, &#8220;Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr  rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah&#8217;s Prophet  had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he  alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family  members of Abu Aiyub, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself  was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet  carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to  Allah&#8217;s Prophet and then went home. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;Which is the nearest of  the houses of our Kith and kin?&#8221; Abu Aiyub replied, &#8220;Mine, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  This is my house and this is my gate.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and prepare a place  for our midday rest.&#8221; Abu Aiyub said, &#8220;Get up (both of you) with Allah&#8217;s  Blessings.&#8221; So when Allah&#8217;s Prophet went into the house, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salaim came  and said &#8220;I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that you have  come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief  and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send  for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam,  for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct.&#8221; So  Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them,  &#8220;O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom none has  the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and  that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam.&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;We  do not know this.&#8221; So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then  he said, &#8220;What sort of a man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of  the most learned amongst us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8221; What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them.&#8221; He came out and said, &#8220;O (the group  of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for  certain that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!&#8217; They said,  &#8220;You tell a lie.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle turned them out. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We migrated with Allah&#8217;s Apostle seeking Allah&#8217;s  Countenance, so our rewards became due and sure with Allah. Some of us passed away without  eating anything of their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar who was  martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not find anything to shroud his body  with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet remained  uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass)  over his feet. And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are  collecting them (i.e. they have received their rewards in this world). </font></p>

Then &#8216;Umar sent me again (to the Prophet ) and said, &#8216;Go and see whether he is awake.&#8217; I  went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance. Then I went back  to &#8216;Umar and informed him that the Prophet was awake. So we both went, running slowly, and  when &#8216;Umar entered his place, he gave him the pledge of allegiance and thereafter I too  gave him the pledge of allegiance,&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr bought a (camel&#8217;s) saddle from &#8216;Azib, and I  carried it for him. &#8216;Azib (i.e. my father) asked Abu Bakr regarding the journey of the  migration of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Close observers were appointed by our  enemies to watch us. So we went out at night and travelled throughout the night and the  following day till it was noon, then we perceived a rock and went towards it, and there  was some shade under it. I spread a cloak I had with me for Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then the  Prophet layed on it. I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming  with his sheep looking for the same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, &#8216;O boy,  to whom do you belong?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I belong to so-and-so.&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;Is there some  milk in your sheep?&#8217; He replied in the affirmative. I asked him, &#8216;Will you milk?&#8217; He  replied in the affirmative. Then he got hold of one of his sheep. I said to him, &#8216;Remove  the dust from its udder.&#8217; Then he milked a little milk. I had a water-skin with me which  was tied with a piece of cloth. I had prepared the water-skin for Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So I  poured some water over the milk (container) till its bottom became cold. Then I brought  the milk to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle drank till I  became pleased. Then we departed and the pursuers were following us.&#8221; Al-Bara added:  I then went with Abu Bakr into his home (carrying that saddle) and there I saw his  daughter &#8216;Aisha Lying in a bed because of heavy fever and I saw her father Abu Bakr  kissing her cheek and saying, &#8220;How are you, little daughter?&#8221; </font></p>

The  Prophet said, &#8220;Do you let others benefit by their milk gratis?&#8221; He replied in  the affirmative. Then the Prophet asked, &#8220;Do you milk them on their watering days and  give their milk to the poor and needy?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative.

May my father  and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But who else is worthy of it (if  not &#8216;Uthman)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As to him, by Allah, death has overtaken him, and I  hope the best for him. By Allah, though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what  Allah will do to me,&#8221; By Allah, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him.  That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for &#8216;Uthman bin  Maz&#8217;un. I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him of it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina, he alighted at the  upper part of Medina among the people called Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and he stayed with them  for fourteen nights. Then he sent for the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar, and they came,  carrying their swords. As if I am just now looking at Allah&#8217;s Apostle on his she-camel  with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar  around him till he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s home. The Prophet used to  offer the prayer wherever the prayer was due, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then  he ordered that the mosque be built. He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when  they came, he said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this garden of  yours.&#8221; They replied &#8220;No! By Allah, we do not demand its price except from  Allah.&#8221; In that garden there were the (following) things that I will tell you: Graves  of pagans, unleveled land with holes and pits etc., and date-palm trees. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug up and, the unleveled land be leveled and the  date-palm trees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the wall  facing the Qibla. The Stone pillars were built at the sides of its gate. The companions of  the Prophet were carrying the stones and reciting some lyrics, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . was  with them and they were saying, &#8220;O Allah! There is no good Excel the good of the  Hereafter, so bestow victory on the Ansar and the Emigrants. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul-Aziz asking As-Sa&#8217;ib, the nephew  of An-Nimr. &#8220;What have you heard about residing in Mecca?&#8221; The other said,  &#8220;I heard Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami saying, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: An Emigrant is allowed  to stay in Mecca for three days after departing from Mina (i.e. after performing all the  ceremonies of Hajj)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet&#8217;s companions did not take as a starting date  for the Muslim calendar, the day, the Prophet had been sent as an Apostle or the day of  his death, but the day of his arrival at Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Originally, two Rakat were prescribed in every prayer. When  the Prophet migrated (to Medina) four Rakat were enjoined, while the journey prayer  remained unchanged(i.e. two Rakat). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 273: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; the Prophet visited me when  I fell ill and was about to die because of that illness. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  I am very ill as you see, and I am a rich man and have no heir except my only daughter.  Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Shall I then give one half of it in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Sad! Give 1/3  (in charity) and even 1/3 is too much. No doubt, it is better to leave your children rich  than to leave them poor, reduced to begging from others. And Allah will reward you for  whatever you spend with the intention of gaining Allah&#8217;s Pleasure even if it were a  mouthful of food you put into your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am  I to be left behind (in Mecca) after my companions have gone?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you  should be left behind, you will be upgraded and elevated for every deed you will do with a  desire to achieve Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. I hope that you will live long so that some people  will benefit by you while others will be harmed. O Allah! Please fulfill the migration of  my companions and do not make them turn back on their heels. But (we feel sorry for) the  unlucky Sad bin Khaulah.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle lamented his death in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 274: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina and the Prophet  established the bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, Saud  suggested that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman should accept half of his property and family. &#8216;Abdur Rahman  said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in your family and property; guide me to the market.&#8221;  So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (while doing business in the market) made some profit of some condensed  dry yoghurt and butter. After a few days the Prophet saw him wearing clothes stained with  yellow perfume. The Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this, O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have married an Ansar&#8217; woman.&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;What have you given her as Mahr?&#8221; He (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) said, &#8220;A piece  of gold, about the weight of a date stone.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, Give a banquet,  even though of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 275: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina  reached &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, He said,  &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is  the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat?  Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?&#8221; The Prophet  replied, &#8220;Gabriel has just now informed me of that.&#8221; Ibn Salam said, &#8220;He  (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The Prophet said, &#8220;As for  the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East  to the West. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the  caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man&#8217;s discharge proceeds  the woman&#8217;s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman&#8217;s  discharge proceeds the man&#8217;s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On this, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;I testify that  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that you are the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one  astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to I slam .  &#8221; The Jews came, and the Prophet said, &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam  among you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;The best of us and the son of the best of us and the  most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us. &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;May Allah protect him from that.&#8221; The Prophet repeated his question and they  gave the same answer. Then &#8216;Abdullah came out to them and said, &#8220;I testify that None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah!&#8221; On this, the Jews said, &#8220;He is the most wicked among us and the son of  the most wicked among us.&#8221; So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin  Salam) said, &#8220;It is this that I was afraid of, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A partner of mine sold some Dirhams on credit in the  market. I said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! Is this legal?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Glorified  be Allah! By Allah, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected to it.&#8221; Then I  asked Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib (about it) he said, &#8220;We used to make such a transaction when  the Prophet came to Medina. So he said, &#8216;There is no harm in it if it is done from hand to  hand, but it is not allowed on credit.&#8217; Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for  he was the greatest trader of all of us.&#8221; So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he said  the same (as Al-Bara) did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet arrived at Medina, he noticed that some  people among the Jews used to respect Ashura&#8217; (i.e. 10th of Muharram) and fast on it. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;We have more right to observe fast on this day.&#8221; and ordered  that fasting should be observed on it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet arrived at Medina he found that the Jews  observed fast on the day of &#8216;Ashura&#8217;. They were asked the reason for the fast. They  replied, &#8220;This is the day when Allah caused Moses and the children of Israel to have  victory over Pharaoh, so we fast on this day as a sign of glorifying it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;We are closer to Moses than you.&#8221; Then he ordered that fasting on  this day should be observed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to keep his hair falling loose while the  pagans used to part their hair, and the People of the Scriptures used to keep their hair  falling loose, and the Prophet liked to follow the People of the Scriptures in matters  about which he had not been instructed differently, but later on the Prophet started  parting his hair. </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Virtues and Merits of the Prophet(Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and his Companions </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.659">Volume 4, Book 56, Number 659: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 660: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 661: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.662"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.663"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.664"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.665"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 666: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar saying, &#8220;May Allah Curse so-and-so!  Doesn&#8217;t he know that the Prophet said, &#8216;May Allah curse the Jews for, though they were  forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. &#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.667"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 667: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Convey (my teachings) to the people  even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have  been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me  intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews and the Christians do  not dye (their grey hair), so you shall do the opposite of what they do (i.e. dye your  grey hair and beards).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.669"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the nations before you  there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife  and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died. Allah said, &#8216;My Slave  hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.670"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.671"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While a lady  was nursing her child, a rider passed by and she said, &#8216;O Allah! Don&#8217;t let my child die  till he becomes like this (rider).&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Don&#8217;t make me like him,&#8217; and  then returned to her breast (sucking it). (After a while) they passed by a lady who was  being pulled and teased (by the people). The child&#8217;s mother said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (talking) on the  pulpit in the year when he performed the Hajj. He took a tuft of hair that was in the hand  of an orderly and said, &#8220;O people of Medina! Where are your learned men? I heard the  Prophet forbidding such a thing as this (i.e. false hair) and he used to say, &#8216;The  Israelis were destroyed when their ladies practiced this habit (of using false hair to  lengthen their locks).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Amongst the men of Bani Israel  there was a man who had murdered ninety-nine persons. Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle; offered the morning prayer and then  faced the people and said, &#8220;While a man was driving a cow, he suddenly rode over it  and beat it. The cow said, &#8220;We have not been created for this, but we have been  created for sloughing.&#8221; On that the people said astonishingly, &#8220;Glorified be  Allah! A cow speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I believe this, and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah! A wolf speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe this,  and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too, believe this, although neither of them was present  there.&#8221; (See the Foot-note of page No. 10 Vol.5) </font></p>

By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I  would cut off her hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was the most beloved person to  &#8216;Aisha excluding the Prophet and Abu Bakr, and he in his turn, was the most devoted to  her, &#8216;Aisha used not to withhold the money given to her by Allah, but she used to spend it  in charity. (&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

Therefore we would like you to give us some instructions which we may follow and convey to  our people staying behind us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to observe four  things and forbid you (to do) four things: (I order you) to believe in Allah testifying  that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah; to offer the prayer perfectly; to  pay the Zakat; and to give one-fifth of the war booty to Allah.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet in a Ghazwa. A large  number of emigrants joined him and among the emigrants there was a person who used to play  jokes (or play with spears); so he (jokingly) stroked an Ansari man on the hip. The  Ans-ari got so angry that both of them called their people. The Ansari said, &#8220;Help, O  Ansar!&#8221; And the emigrant said &#8220;Help, O emigrants!&#8221; The Prophet came out and  said, &#8220;What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the period of  Ignorance? &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;What is the matter with them?&#8221; So he was told  about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The Prophet said, &#8220;Stop this (i.e.  appeal for help) for it is an evil call. &#8220;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul (a hypocrite)  said, &#8220;The emigrants have called and (gathered against us); so when we return to  Medina, surely, the more honorable people will expel therefrom the meaner,&#8221; Upon that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Shall we not kill this evil person (i.e. Abdullah bin  Ubai bin Salul) ?&#8221; The Prophet) said, &#8220;(No), lest the people should say that  Muhammad used to kill his companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of  Abu Dhar&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Dhar  said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you go to bed before  offering the Witr prayer?&#8217; He said, &#8216;My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik telling us about the night when the  Prophet was made to travel from the Ka&#8217;ba Mosque. Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the  Prophet before he was divinely inspired was an Aspostle), while he was sleeping in Al  Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

They could  not find water to perform the ablution. One of them went away and brought a little amount  of water in a pot. The Prophet took it and performed the ablution, and then stretched his  four fingers on to the pot and said (to the people), &#8220;Get up to perform the  ablution.&#8221; They started performing the ablution till all of them did it, and they  were seventy or so persons. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;Once the time of the prayer  became due and the people whose houses were close to the Mosque went to their houses to  perform ablution, while the others remained (sitting there). A stone pot containing water  was brought to the Prophet, who wanted to put his hand in it, but It was too small for him  to spread his hand in it, and so he had to bring his fingers together before putting his  hand in the pot. Then all the people performed the ablution (with that water).&#8221; I  asked Anas, &#8220;How many persons were they.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There were eighty  men.&#8221; </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

We stayed for  a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our  riding animals drank water to their satisfaction. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have noticed  feebleness in the voice of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which I think, is caused by hunger. Have you  got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She brought out some loaves of barley and  took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my  arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food? I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out. Then he again said, &#8216;&#8221;&#8216;Let another ten persons (do the  same.)&#8221; They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, &#8220;Let  another ten persons come.&#8221; In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were  seventy or eighty men. </font></p>

He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come  to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from  among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah,  when it was being eaten (by him). </font></p>

So please come  with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one  of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat  on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what  remained was as much as had been paid to them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 781: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing)  what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

Zainab said, &#8220;I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though amongst us there are pious people? &#8216; He  said, &#8216;Yes, if evil increases.&#8221; </font></p>

And  whoever will look towards those afflictions, they will overtake him, and whoever will find  a refuge or a shelter, should take refuge in it.&#8221; The same narration is reported by  Abu Bakr, with the addition, &#8220;(The Prophet said), &#8216;Among the prayers there is a  prayer the missing of which will be to one like losing one&#8217;s family and property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about good, but I  used to ask him about evil for fear that it might overtake me. Once I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were in ignorance and in evil and Allah has bestowed upon us the  present good; will there by any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;Will there be good after that evil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, but it would be  tained with Dakhan (i.e. Little evil).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will its Dakhan be?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;There will be some people who will lead (people) according to principles  other than my tradition. You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Describe  those people to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will belong to us and speak our  language&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place  in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e.  eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Allah while you are still in that state.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

We said to him, &#8220;Would you seek help for us?  Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Musailama-al-Kadhdhab (i.e. the liar) came in the life-time  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with many of his people (to Medina) and said, &#8220;If Muhammad makes  me his successor, I will follow him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went up to him with Thabit bin  Qais bin Shams; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was carrying a piece of a date-palm leaf in his hand.  He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;In a dream I saw myself migrating  from Mecca to a place having plenty of date trees. I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

I  asked her, &#8220;Why are you weeping?&#8221; He again told her a secret and she started  laughing. I said, &#8220;I never saw happiness so near to sadness as I saw today.&#8221; I  asked her what the Prophet had told her. She said, &#8220;I would never disclose the secret  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; When the Prophet died, I asked her about it. She replied.  &#8220;The Prophet said.) &#8216;Every year Gabriel used to revise the Qur&#8217;an with me once only,  but this year he has done so twice. I think this portends my death, and you will be the  first of my family to follow me.&#8217; So I started weeping.

So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he can  either benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their  good people (i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers.&#8221; That was the  last gathering which the Prophet attended. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh came to Mecca with the intention of  performing &#8216;Umra, and stayed at the house of Umaiya bin Khalaf Abi Safwan, for Umaiya  himself used to stay at Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s house when he passed by Medina on his way to Sham. Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.&#8221; Umaiya went to his  wife and said to her, &#8220;Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has  said to me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What has he said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He claims that he  has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, By Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam, making him 60  cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels,  and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting  (salutations of your offspring.&#8221; So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum  (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, &#8220;As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi&#8221;  (i.e. Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam&#8217;s salutation the  expression, &#8216;Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,&#8217; Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in  appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam&#8217;s creation. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 544: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first group of people who  will enter Paradise, will be glittering like the full moon and those who will follow them,  will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve  nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat  will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be  houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in statute),  sixty cubits tall.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 545: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Salama said, &#8220;Um Salaim said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Allah does not refrain from saying the truth! Is it obligatory for a woman to take a bath  after she gets nocturnal discharge?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, if she notices the water (i.e.  discharge).&#8217; Um Salama smiled and said, &#8216;Does a woman get discharge?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said. &#8216;Then why does a child resemble (its mother)?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 546: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet  at Medina, he came to him and said, &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which  nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the Hour? What will be the  first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why  does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel has just now  told me of their answers.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all  the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first portent  of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west;  the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver.  As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with  his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman  gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said,  &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam further said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my  conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they would tell a lie about me.&#8221;  The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and &#8216;Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked (the Jews), &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the  son of the best amongst us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What do you think if he  embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;May Allah save him  from it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, &#8220;I testify  that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; Thereupon they said, &#8220;He is the evilest among us, and the son of the  evilest amongst us,&#8221; and continued talking badly of him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;But for the Israelis, meat would  not decay and but for Eve, wives would never betray their husbands.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.055.548"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 548: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Treat women nicely, for a  women is created from a rib, and the most curved portion of the rib is its upper portion,  so, if you should try to straighten it, it will break, but if you leave it as it is, it  will remain crooked. So treat women nicely.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 549: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the true and truly inspired said,  &#8220;(as regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother  for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for an other forty days, and then a  piece of flesh for an other forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He  writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be  wretched or blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may  do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only  the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel)  surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and  enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of  Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and  then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the  people of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 550: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has appointed an angel in the  womb, and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord! A drop of discharge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a clot, O  Lord! a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete the child&#8217;s creation, the  angel will say. &#8216;O Lord! A male or a female? O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)?  What will his livelihood be? What will his age be?&#8217; The angel writes all this while the  child is in the womb of its mother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 551: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah will say to that person of  the (Hell) Fire who will receive the least punishment, &#8216;If you had everything on the  earth, would you give it as a ransom to free yourself (i.e. save yourself from this  Fire)?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then Allah will say, &#8216;While you were in the backbone of Adam,  I asked you much less than this, i.e. not to worship others besides Me, but you insisted  on worshipping others besides me.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 552: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whenever a person is murdered  unjustly, there is a share from the burden of the crime on the first son of Adam for he  was the first to start the tradition of murdering.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.055.553"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 553: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood amongst the people, glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved and then mentioned the Dajjal saying, &#8220;l warn you  against him (i.e. the Dajjal) and there was no prophet but warned his nation against him.  No doubt, Noah warned his nation against him but I tell you about him something of which  no prophet told his nation before me. You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is  not one-eyed.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.055.554"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 554: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you about the  Dajjal a story of which no prophet told his nation? The Dajjall is one-eyed and will bring  with him what will resemble Hell and Paradise, and what he will call Paradise will be  actually Hell; so I warn you (against him) as Noah warned his nation against him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet at a banquet and a  cooked (mutton) forearm was set before him, and he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it  and said, &#8220;I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you  know how Allah will gather all the first and the last (people) in one level place where an  observer will be able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer,  and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don&#8217;t you see, in what condition  you are and the state to which you have reached? Why don&#8217;t you look for a person who can  intercede for you with your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.&#8217; They  will go to him and say: &#8216;O Adam! You are the father of all mankind, and Allah created you  with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in  Paradise. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don&#8217;t you see in what (miserable)  state we are, and to what condition we have reached?&#8217; On that Adam will reply, &#8216;My Lord is  so angry as He has never been before and will never be in the future; (besides), He  forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself!  Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.&#8217; They will go to Noah and say; &#8216;O Noah! You are  the first amongst the messengers of Allah to the people of the earth, and Allah named you  a thankful slave. Don&#8217;t you see in what a (miserable) state we are and to what condition  we have reached? Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Noah will reply: &#8216;Today my  Lord has become so angry as he had never been before and will never be in the future  Myself! Myself! Go to the Prophet (Muhammad). The people will come to me, and I will  prostrate myself underneath Allah&#8217;s Throne. Then I will be addressed: &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise  your head; intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything). for  you will be given. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been made victorious with  As-Saba (i.e. an easterly wind) and the people of &#8216;Ad were destroyed by Ad-Dabur (i.e. a  westerly wind).&#8221; Narrated Abu Said: Ali sent a piece of gold to the Prophet who  distributed it among four persons: Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habis Al-Hanzali from the tribe of  Mujashi, &#8216;Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, Zaid At-Ta&#8217;i who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani  Nahban, and &#8216;Alqama bin Ulatha Al-&#8216;Amir who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Kilab. So the  Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief  of Najd and does not give us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I give them) so as to attract  their hearts (to Islam).&#8221; Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised  forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said,  &#8220;Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!&#8221; The Prophet &#8216; said &#8220;Who would obey Allah  if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me  while, you do not trust me?&#8221; Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested  the Prophet to let him chop that man&#8217;s head off, but he prevented him. When the man left,  the Prophet said, &#8220;Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the  Qur&#8217;an but the Qur&#8217;an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like  parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the  religion as an arrow goes through the game&#8217;s body. They will kill the Muslims but will not  disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time&#8217; I will kill them as the people  of &#8216;Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them).&#8221; </font></p>

Someone said to the tyrant, &#8220;This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very  charming lady.&#8221; So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, &#8220;Who  is this lady?&#8221; Abraham said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; Abraham went to Sarah and  said, &#8220;O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I.  This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don&#8217;t  contradict my statement.&#8221; The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he  tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded.  He asked Sarah. &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you.&#8221; So Sarah asked  Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but  (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again  requested Sarah, &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you.&#8221; Sarah asked  Allah again and he became alright.

Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;  She replied, &#8220;Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and  gave me Hajar for service.&#8221; (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying,  &#8220;That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of  Ishmael, Hajar&#8217;s son).&#8221; </font></p>

Will you intercede for us with your Lord?&#8217; Abraham  will then remember his lies and say: &#8216;Myself! Myself! Go to Moses.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on the  mother of Ishmael! Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the  Zam-zam well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas further added, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael and his mother (to  Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a water-skin with her.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael.  She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and  her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the  spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in  Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a  leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set  out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;O Abraham! Where are you going,  leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is  there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look  back at her Then she asked him, &#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221; and returned while  Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he  faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a  valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord,  that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards  them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217; (14.37)  Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she  became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e.  Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and  found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on  it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could  not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked  up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed  the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting  to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa  and Marwa) seven times.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the source of the tradition  of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa  (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened  attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made  me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel  at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed  from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in  this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was  flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on  Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she  not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream  flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;Then she drank  (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected,  for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah  never neglects His people.&#8217; The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place  resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived  in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by  her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;.  They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying  around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though  we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who  discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all  came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near  the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but  you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet  further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to  love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent  for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent  residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his  virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of  puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after  Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find  Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search  of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and  she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217;  complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and  tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed  to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I  informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living  in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the  threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce  you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from  amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s  wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217;  Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living.  She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then  she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He  said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their  meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and  if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition  will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then  Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and  tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he  asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came  to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he  asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked  her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards  to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael  said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to  keep you with me.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam,  sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted  each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O  Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to  do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said,  Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land  surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the  House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the  walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and  carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were  saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round  the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the  All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 584: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of  her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&#8217;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away.  They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&#8217;s mother used to drink  water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham  reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&#8217;s mother  followed him, and when they reached Kada&#8217;, she called him from behind, &#8216;O Abraham! To whom  are you leaving us?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I am leaving you) to Allah&#8217;s (Care).&#8217; She said, &#8216;I am  satisfied to be with Allah.&#8217; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the  water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she  said to herself, &#8216;I&#8217;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&#8217; She ascended the  Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the  valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two  mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &#8216;i&#8217;d better go and see the state of the  child,&#8217; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not  endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &#8216;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&#8217;  She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find  anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she  said (to herself), &#8216;I&#8217;d better go back and see the state of the child.&#8217; But suddenly she  heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &#8216;Help us if you can offer any help.&#8217;  Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this  (Ibn &#8216;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out.  Ishmael&#8217;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet)  said, &#8220;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would  have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;) Ishmael&#8217;s mother started drinking  from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe  of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that  astonished them, and they said, &#8216;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&#8217;  They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform  them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &#8216;O ishmael&#8217;s mother! Will you allow us  to be with you (or dwell with you)?&#8217; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy  reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham  which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &#8216;I want to call on my dependents I left (at  Mecca).&#8217; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&#8217;s wife) and said, &#8216;Where is Ishmael?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;He has gone out hunting.&#8217; Abraham said (to her), &#8216;When he comes, tell him to  change the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael  said to her, &#8216;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&#8217; Again  Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his  wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&#8217;s house and asked. &#8220;Where is  Ishmael?&#8221; Ishmael&#8217;s wife replied, &#8220;He has gone out hunting,&#8221; and added,  &#8220;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&#8217; Abraham asked,  &#8216;What is your food and what is your drink?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Our food is meat and our drink  is water.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&#8221; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e.  Prophet) said, &#8220;Because of Abraham&#8217;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&#8221;  Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his  wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending  his arrows. He said, &#8220;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for  Him.&#8221; Ishmael said, &#8220;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&#8221; Abraham said,  &#8220;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&#8221; Ishmael said,  &#8220;Then I will do.&#8221; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&#8217;ba)  while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8220;O our  Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham)  could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of  Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O  our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&#8221;  (2.127) </font></p>

Why don&#8217;t we rebuild  it on the foundations of Abraham?&#8221; He said. &#8220;But for the fact that your folk  have recently given up infidelity (I would have done so).&#8221; </font></p>

We do not ask  about this.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then the most honorable person is Joseph, Allah&#8217;s  Prophet, the son of Allah&#8217;s Prophet, the son of Allah&#8217;s Prophet, the son of Allah&#8217;s  Khalil.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not ask about this.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then you  want to ask me about the Arabs&#8217; descent?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Those who were best in the pre-lslamic period, are the best in Islam, if they  comprehend (the religious knowledge).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Um Ruman, &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s mother about the accusation  forged against &#8216;Aisha. She said, &#8220;While I was sitting with &#8216;Aisha, an Ansari woman  came to us and said, &#8216;Let Allah condemn such-and-such person.&#8217; I asked her, &#8216;Why do you  say so?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;For he has spread the (slanderous) story.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;What  story?&#8217; The woman then told her the story. &#8216;Aisha asked, &#8216;Have Abu Bakr and Allah&#8217;s  Apostle heard about it ?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha fell down senseless (on hearing that),  and when she came to her senses, she got fever and shaking of the body. The Prophet came  and asked, &#8216;What is wrong with her?&#8217; I said, &#8216;She has got fever because of a story which  has been rumored.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha got up and said, &#8216;By Allah! Even if I took an oath, you would  not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and  your example is just like that example of Jacob and his sons. Against that which you  assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; (12.18) The Prophet left and then  Allah revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Thanks to  Allah (only) and not to anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of  the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;(Respite will be granted) &#8216;Until when the apostles give up  hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their  people)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;(12.110) &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Really, their nations did not  believe them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! They were definite that their nations treated  them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uraiya  (i.e. &#8216;Urwa)! No doubt, they were quite sure about it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;May the Verse be read in such a way as to  mean that the apostles thought that Allah did not help them?&#8221; Aisha said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this  Verse is concerned with the Apostles&#8217; followers who had faith in their Lord and believed  in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Allah&#8217;s Help was delayed till  the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and  suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah&#8217;s Help then came to  them.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: The Prophet said, &#8220;The honorable, the son of the  honorable, the son of the honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the  son of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>

Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8220;My friend and I have differed  regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning something about him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8216;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked  (him), &#8216;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So, Allah  sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).&#8217;  Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and  he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So,  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said  to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish,  and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.&#8217; Moses said, That was what  we were seeking after,&#8217; and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found  Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Ibn Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses,  the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some  other Moses.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai  bin Ka&#8217;b told us that the Prophet said, &#8216;Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He  was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &#8216;I.&#8217; Allah admonished  him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him,  &#8216;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than  you.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in  a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&#8217; Moses  took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &#8216;bin  Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept,  and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea  (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became  like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest  of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &#8216;Give us our food, for  indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; Moses did not feel tired  till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant)  said to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and  none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the  sea in an amazing way?.&#8217; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses  said, &#8216;That was what we were seeking after.&#8217; So, both of them retraced their footsteps  till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses  greeted him and he replied saying, &#8216;How do people greet each other in your land?&#8217; Moses  said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man asked, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes, I have come  to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O  Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do  not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and  which I do not know.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;May I follow you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;But you will not be able  to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be  able to understand?&#8217; (Moses said, &#8216;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and  I will not disobey you in aught.&#8217;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a  boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board  the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or  twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge  have not decreased Allah&#8217;s Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the  water of the sea with its beak.&#8217; Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank,  and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him,  &#8216;What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have  intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have  done a dreadful thing.&#8217; Al-Khadir replied, &#8216;Did I not tell you that you would not be able  to remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and  do not be hard upon me for my fault.&#8217; So the first excuse of Moses was that he had  forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with  his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was  plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent person who has  not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.&#8221; Al-Khadir said,  &#8220;Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses said &#8220;If I  ask you about anything after this, don&#8217;t accompany me. You have received an excuse from  me.&#8217; Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked  its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw  therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by  touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands,  illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said,  &#8220;These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor  entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could  have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;This is the parting between you and  me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain  patient.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have remained patient  by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the  sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he  had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.&#8221;) </font></p>

One of the  children of Israel hurt him by saying, &#8216;He covers his body in this way only because of  some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&#8217;  Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in  seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When  he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone  took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &#8216;O  stone! Give me my garment!&#8217; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then,  and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had  accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started  hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the  hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:&#8211; &#8220;O  you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence  of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8221; (33.69) </font></p>

What will happen after  that?&#8221; Allah replied, &#8220;Then death.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Let it come  now.&#8221; Moses then requested Allah to let him die close to the Sacred Land so much so  that he would be at a distance of a stone&#8217;s throw from it.&#8221; Abu Huraira added,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If I were there, I would show you his grave below the red  sand hill on the side of the road.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give me superiority over Moses, for the people  will become unconscious (on the Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain  consciousness to see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah&#8217;s Throne.

The trumpet will be  blown for the second time and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Moses holding  Allah&#8217;s Throne.

So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and  sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten  time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Fast on  every third day.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If anyone testifies that None has  the right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His  Slave and His Apostle, and that Jesus is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle and His Word which  He bestowed on Mary and a Spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is true, and Hell is  true, Allah will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those  deeds were few.&#8221; (Junada, the sub-narrator said, &#8221; &#8216;Ubada added, &#8216;Such a person  can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 645: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None spoke in cradle but three:  (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While  he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), &#8216;Shall  I answer her or keep on praying?&#8221; (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his  mother said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of  prostitutes.&#8221; So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him,  but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal  sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it  belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and  expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer,  and then came to the child and said, &#8216;O child! Who is your father?&#8217; The child replied,  &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; (After hearing this) the people said, &#8216;We shall rebuild your hermitage of  gold,&#8217; but he said, &#8216;No, of nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following  story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider  passed by her. She said, &#8216;O Allah ! Make my child like him.&#8217; On that the child left her  breast, and facing the rider said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make me like him.&#8217; The child then  started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, &#8220;As if I were now  looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.&#8221;) After a while  the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child&#8217;s mother) said, &#8216;O Allah!  Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; When she asked why, the child replied, &#8216;The rider is one of  the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

I  saw Abraham whom I resembled more than any of his children did.&#8221; The Prophet further  said, &#8220;(That night) I was given two cups; one full of milk and the other full of  wine. I was asked to take either of them which I liked, and I took the milk and drank it.  On that it was said to me, &#8216;You have taken the right path (religion). If you had taken the  wine, your (Muslim) nation would have gone astray.&#8221; </font></p>

While sleeping near the Ka&#8217;ba last night, I  saw in my dream a man of brown color the best one can see amongst brown color and his hair  was long that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was dribbling  from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while  circumambulating the Kaba. I asked, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;This is Jesus, son of  Mary.&#8217; Behind him I saw a man who had very curly hair and was blind in the right eye,  resembling Ibn Qatan (i.e. an infidel) in appearance. He was placing his hands on the  shoulders of a person while performing Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.

I asked, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; The people said, &#8216;He is the  son of Mary.&#8217; Then I looked behind and I saw a red-complexioned, fat, curly-haired man,  blind in the right eye which looked like a bulging out grape.

Money will be in abundance so that nobody  will accept it, and a single prostration to Allah (in prayer) will be better than the  whole world and whatever is in it.&#8221; Abu Huraira added &#8220;If you wish, you can  recite (this verse of the Holy Book): &#8212; &#8216;And there is none Of the people of the  Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Allah  and a human being) Before his death.

<h3 align="center"><font>Beginning of Creation </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.054.413">Volume 4, Book 54, Number 413: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet and he said  (to them), &#8220;O Bani Tamim! rejoice with glad tidings.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You have  given us glad tidings, now give us something.&#8221; On hearing that the color of his face  changed then the people of Yemen came to him and he said, &#8220;O people of Yemen ! Accept  the good tidings, as Bani Tamim has refused them.&#8221; The Yemenites said, &#8220;We  accept them. Then the Prophet started taking about the beginning of creation and about  Allah&#8217;s Throne. In the mean time a man came saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Imran! Your she-camel has run  away!&#8221; (I got up and went away), but l wish I had not left that place (for I missed what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 414: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet and tied my she-camel at the gate.  The people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet who said &#8220;O Bani Tamim! Accept the good  tidings.&#8221; They said twice, &#8216;You have given us the good tidings, now give us  something&#8221; Then some Yemenites came to him and he said, &#8220;Accept the good  tidings, O people of Yemem, for Bani Tamim refused them.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We accept  it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have come to ask you about this matter (i.e. the start of  creations).&#8221; He said, &#8220;First of all, there was nothing but Allah, and (then He  created His Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the Book  (in the Heaven) and created the Heavens and the Earth.&#8221; Then a man shouted, &#8220;O  Ibn Husain! Your she-camel has gone away!&#8221; So, I went away and could not see the  she-camel because of the mirage. By Allah, I wished I had left that she-camel (but not  that gathering). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: One day the Prophet stood up amongst us for  a long period and informed us about the beginning of creation (and talked about everything  in detail) till he mentioned how the people of Paradise will enter their places and the  people of Hell will enter their places. Some remembered what he had said, and some forgot  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah the Most Superior said,  &#8220;The son of Adam slights Me, and he should not slight Me, and he disbelieves in Me,  and he ought not to do so. As for his slighting Me, it is that he says that I have a son;  and his disbelief in Me is his statement that I shall not recreate him as I have created  (him) before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>from Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who had a dispute with  some people on a piece of land, and so he went to &#8216;Aisha and told her about it. She said,  &#8220;O Abu Salama, avoid the land, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Any person who takes even a  span of land unjustly, his neck shall be encircled with it down seven earths.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said. &#8220;(The division of time has turned to  its original form which was current when Allah created the Heavens and the Earths. The  year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession  Dhul-Qa&#8217; da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar  which comes between Jumadi-ath-Thaniyah and Sha ban.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Arwa sued him before Marwan for a right, which she  claimed, he had deprived her of. On that Said said, &#8220;How should I deprive her of her  right?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet asked me at sunset, &#8220;Do you know where the  sun goes (at the time of sunset)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath  the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time  will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be  accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but  it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that  is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And the sun Runs its fixed course  For a term (decreed). that is The Decree of (Allah) The Exalted in Might, The  All-Knowing.&#8221; (36.38) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse  because of someone&#8217;s death or wife (i.e. birth), but they are two signs amongst the Signs  of Allah. So, if you see them (i.e. eclipse) offer the Prayer (of eclipse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up (to  offer the eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy Verses),  bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying. &#8220;Allah hears him who sends  his praises to Him.&#8221; Then he stayed standing, recited a long recitation again, but  shorter than the former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a long  prostration and then performed the second Rak&#8217;a in the same way as he had done the first.  By the time he had finished his prayer with Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then  he addressed the people referring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, &#8220;These are  two signs amongst the Signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of anyone&#8217;s death or  life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been made victorious with  the Saba (i.e. easterly wind) and the people of &#8216;Ad were destroyed with the Dabur (i.e.  westerly wind) .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said If the Prophet saw a cloud In the sky, he would  walk to and fro in agitation, go out and come in, and the color of his face would change,  and if it rained, he would feel relaxed.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha knew that state of his. So the  Prophet said, I don&#8217;t know (am afraid), it may be similar to what happened to some people  referred to in the Holy Quran in the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;Then when they saw it as a  dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, &#8216;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&#8217;  Nay, but, it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened a wind wherein is  severe torment.&#8221; (46.24) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Sasaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While I was at the House in a state  midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between  two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut  open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with  Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal,  smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel.  When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, &#8216;Open the  gate.&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; The gate-keeper,&#8217; Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; The gate-keeper said, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217;  Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, &#8216;You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then  we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It  was said, &#8216;Who is with you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8221; Then I met  Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.&#8217; Then we  ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was  asked, &#8216;Who is with you? Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217;  &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Gabriel. &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217; (The Prophet  added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother  and a Prophet!&#8217; Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and  answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He  said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.&#8217; Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met  and greeted Aaron who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet&#8221;. Then we  ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in  the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother  and. a Prophet.&#8217; When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was  weeping, he said, &#8216;O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter  Paradise in greater number than my followers.&#8217; Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I  met and greeted Abraham who said, &#8216;You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then I was shown  Al-Bait-al-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. Allah&#8217;s House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al  Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never  return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).&#8217; Then I was shown  Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which  resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears  of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two  were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, &#8216;The two hidden rivers are in  Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; Then fifty prayers were  enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I know the people better than you,  because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers  cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the  number of prayers.&#8217; I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I  returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah  for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who  repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again,  he said, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah has made it five only.&#8217; He repeated the same  advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah&#8217;s Final Order)'&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  addressed by Allah, &#8220;I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My  slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mus&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the true and truly inspired said,  &#8220;(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the  mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and  then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to  write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature&#8217;s) deeds, his  livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion).  Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is  only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his  behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire.  And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him  and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he  starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.053.324">Volume 4, Book 53, Number 324: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day  (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet had given me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I  intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I had an appointment with a  goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa&#8217; to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of  pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I  was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two  she-camels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after  collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their  flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of  my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done this?&#8221; The  people replied, &#8220;Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in  this house.&#8221; I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with  him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet  asked. &#8220;What is wrong with you.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have  never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and  ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some  drunks.&#8221; The Prophet then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out  walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He  asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red.  Hamza looked at Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he  raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at  his face. Hamza then said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you but the slaves of my father?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle retreated, and we went out with  him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah &#8216;s  Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her  share of inheritance from what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained  without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to  be used for charity).&#8221; Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and stopped  speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained  alive for six months after the death of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted  for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, &#8220;I will not leave  anything Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the  Prophet&#8217;s tradition, then I would go astray.&#8221; (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet&#8217;s  property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, but he withheld the properties of  Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, &#8220;These two properties are the Sadaqa which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is  to be entrusted to the ruler.&#8221; (Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;They have been managed in this  way till today.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 326: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot.  Suddenly the messenger of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, &#8220;The chief of the  believers has sent for you.&#8221; So, I went along with him till I entered the place where  &#8216;Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and  he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, &#8220;O Malik!  Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift  should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O man! Take it.&#8221; While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa&#8217; came  saying, &#8220;&#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking  your permission (to see you); may I admit them?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, So they  were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa&#8217; came again  and said, &#8220;May I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; So, they  were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali).&#8221; They had a dispute  regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The  group (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge  between them and relieve both of them front each other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Be  patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our (i.e. prophets&#8217;) property will not be inherited, and  whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself  (by saying &#8220;we&#8221;)?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned to  &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said so?&#8221; They replied, &#8221; He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;So, I will  talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of  something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then recited the  Holy Verses: &#8220;What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them  &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power  to His Apostles over whomever He will &#8216;And Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; 9:6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar added &#8220;So this property was especially given to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor  did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and  distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to  spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of  its revenue to be spent on Allah &#8216;s Cause. Allah &#8216;s Apostle kept on doing this during all  his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?&#8221; They replies in the affirmative.  &#8216;Umar then said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas. &#8220;I ask you by Allah, do you know this?&#8221;  &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, &#8216;Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the  same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and  rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him  and I became Abu Bakr&#8217;s successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first  two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do and  as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and  a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. &#8216;Ah and &#8216;Abbas) came to talk to me,  bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, &#8216;Abbas, came to me asking for  your share from your nephew&#8217;s property, and this man, i.e. &#8216;Ali, came to me asking for his  wife&#8217;s share from her father&#8217;s property. I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our  (prophets&#8217;) properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used  for charity).&#8217; When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I  said to you, &#8216;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition  that you would take Allah&#8217;s Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in  charge of it.&#8217; So, both of you said (to me), &#8216;Hand it over to us,&#8217; and on that condition I  handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this  condition?&#8221; The group aid, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar faced &#8216;Ali and Abbas saying,  &#8220;I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes. &#8221; He said, &#8221; Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah,  by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other  than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to  me, and I will do the job on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

So please order us some instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and  also invite our people whom we left behind us to observe as well.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;I order you (to do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I order you to  believe in Allah, that is, to testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah  (the Prophet pointed with his hand); to offer prayers perfectly; to pay Zakat; to fast the  month of Ramadan, and to pay the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth) of the war booty to Allah and I  forbid you to use Ad-dubba&#8217;, An-Naqir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat (i.e. utensils used for  preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1). </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be subjected to trials in her religion  (because of jealousy).&#8221; The Prophet then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was from  the tribe of &#8216;Abu Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, &#8220;Whatever  he said was the truth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal  thing illegal, nor do I make an illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and the daughter of the enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as  the wives of one man) (See Hadith No. 76, Vo. 5). </font></p>

You are under Allah&#8217;s Order and I  am under Allah&#8217;s Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.&#8217; It was stopped till  Allah made him victorious. </font></p>

Then that prophet said (to the man), &#8216;The theft has been committed by your people. So all  the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with  me.&#8217; The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said,  &#8220;You have committed the theft.&#8217; Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a  cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet added: Then  Allah saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us.&#8221; </font></p>

Later on Makhrama came along with his son Al-Miswar bin Makhrama, and stood up at  the gate and said (to his son). &#8220;Call him (i.e. the Prophet) to me.&#8221; The Prophet  heard his voice, took a silken cloak and brought it to him, placing those golden buttons  in front of him saying, &#8220;O Abu-al-Miswar! I have kept this aside for you! O Abu-al  Miswar! I have kept this aside for you!&#8221; Makhrama was a bad-tempered man. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he  called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, &#8220;O my son! Today one will be  killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an  oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will  be something left for us from our money?&#8221; Az-Zubair added, &#8220;O my son! Sell our  property and pay my debts.&#8221; Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and  willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sons. He said,  &#8220;One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts,  one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.&#8221; (Hisham, a  sub-narrator added, &#8220;Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of  Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and &#8216;Abbas. &#8216;Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that  time.&#8221; (The narrator &#8216;Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my  attention to his debts saying, &#8220;If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal  to my Master to help you.&#8221; By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I  asked, &#8220;O father! Who is your Master?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah (is my  Master).&#8221; By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say,  &#8220;Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .&#8221; and Allah would (help me  to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one  of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and  one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought  some money to deposit with him. Az Zubair would say, &#8220;No, (i won&#8217;t keep it as a  trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.&#8221; Az-Zubair was  never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but  he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took  part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, and &#8216;Uthman. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred  thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met Abdullah bin Zubair and asked,  &#8220;O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah kept it as a secret  and said, &#8220;One hundred thousand,&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;By Allah! I don&#8217;t think your  property will cover it.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah said to him, &#8220;What if it is two  million and two hundred thousand?&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can pay it; so  if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.&#8221; Az-Zubair had already bought  Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. &#8216;Abdullah sold it for one million and six  hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, &#8220;Any person who has any money  claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.&#8221; There came to him &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ja&#8217;far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair,  &#8220;If you wish I will forgive you the debt.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Ibn Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;If you wish you can defer the payment if you  should defer the payment of any debt.&#8221; Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah  bin Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;Give me a piece of the land.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to  him), &#8220;Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.&#8221; So, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt  perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to  Mu&#8217;awlya while &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam&#8217;a were sitting with  him. Mu&#8217;awiya asked, &#8220;At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;One hundred thousand for each share,&#8221; Muawiya asked, &#8220;How many shares have  been left?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Four and a half shares.&#8221; Al-Mundhir bin  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Amr  bin &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Ibn  Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Muawiya  said, &#8220;How much is left now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;One share and a  half.&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty  thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn  AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair&#8217;s sons said to him, &#8220;Distribute our  inheritance among us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among  you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, &#8216;Would those who have money claims on  Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.&#8221; So, he started to announce that  in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the  inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his  property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and  two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two  hundred thousand. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakim and Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle after  they had embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war prisoners to  them, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;To me the best talk is the truest, so you may choose  either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayed their  distribution.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had waited for them for over ten days when he returned  from Ta&#8217;if. So, when those people came to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to  return to them except one of the two things the said, &#8220;We choose our war Prisoners  &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up amongst the Muslims, and after glorifying Allah as He deserved,  he said, &#8220;Now then, these brothers of yours have come to us with repentance, and I  see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do  that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to his share,  let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai&#8217; (i.e.  war booty received without fight) which Allah will give us.&#8221; On that, all the people  said. &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)&#8221;  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them &#8220;I do not know who amongst you has agreed to this  and who has not. You should return and let your leaders inform me of your agreement.&#8221;  The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission to  return the war prisoners (without Compensation)&#8221; (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states)  This is what has been related to us about the captives of Hawazin. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once we were in the house of Abu Musa who presented a meal  containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Allah with red complexion as  if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa invited him to share  the meal but he (apologised) saying. &#8220;I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I  have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat  chickens.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e.  how to cancel one&#8217;s oat ). I went to the Prophet in the company of a group of  Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, &#8216;By Allah, I will  not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.&#8217; Then  some camels as booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked for us saying. &#8216;Where  are the group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyun?&#8217; Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with  white humps. When we set out we said, &#8216;What have we done? We will never be blessed (with  what we have been given).&#8217; So, we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8216;We asked you to  provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us  with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He  replied. &#8216;I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Allah has provided you  with it, and by Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on  I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is  better, and give expiation for my oath.&#8221; </font></p>

We were, I and my two brothers, I being the  youngest, and one of my brothers was Abu Burda and the other was Abu Ruhm. We were over  fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) men from our people. We got on board a ship which took  us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja&#8217;far bin Abu Talib and his companions  with An-Najaishi. Ja&#8217;far said (to us), &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has sent us here and ordered  us to stay here, so you too, stay with us.&#8221; We stayed with him till we all left  (Ethiopia) and met the Prophet at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a  share from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part  in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share to any person who had not  participated in Khaibar&#8217;s conquest except the people of our ship, besides Ja&#8217;far and his  companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship). </font></p>

When the Bahrain property came. Abu Bakr  ordered somebody to announce, &#8220;Any person who has money claim on Allah&#8217;s Apostle or  whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised something, should come to us.&#8221; So, I went to him  and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much.&#8221; Abu Bakr  scooped up money with both hands thrice for me.&#8221; (The sub-narrator Sufyan illustrated  this action by scooping up with both hands and said, &#8220;Ibn Munkadir, another  sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.&#8221;) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: Once I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the  money but he did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I went  to him for the third time and said, &#8220;I asked you, but you did not give me; then I  asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me; then I asked you (for the third  time) but you did not give me. You should either give me or allow yourself to be  considered a miser regarding my case.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;You tell me that I am a  miser with regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the  inclination to give you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up  money with both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was five  hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was standing in the row on the day (of the battle)  of Badr, I looked to my right and my left and saw two young Ansari boys, and I wished I  had been stronger than they. One of them called my attention saying, &#8220;O Uncle! Do you  know Abu Jahl?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, What do you want from him, O my nephew?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I have been informed that he abuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle. By Him in Whose Hands my  life is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet  his fate.&#8221; I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention  saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the  people. I said (to the boys), &#8220;Look! This is the man you asked me about.&#8221; So,  both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death and returned to  Allah&#8217;S Apostle to inform him of that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Which of you has  killed him?&#8221; Each of them said, &#8220;I Have killed him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;Have you cleaned your swords?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No. &#8221; He then looked at  their swords and said, &#8220;No doubt, you both have killed him and the spoils of the  deceased will be given to Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh.&#8221; The two boys were Muadh bin  &#8216;Afra and Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of  the battle) of Hunain. When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan  throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him  on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so  violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released  me. I followed &#8216;Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), &#8220;What is wrong with the people  (fleeing)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;This is the Will of Allah,&#8221; After the people  returned, the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof  of that, will posses his spoils.&#8221; I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be a witness for  me?&#8221; and then sat down. The Prophet again said, &#8220;Anyone who has killed an enemy  and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.&#8221; I (again) got up and said, &#8220;Who  will be a witness for me?&#8221; and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third  time. I again got up, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Abu Qatada! What is your  story?&#8221; Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me.  So please compensate him on my behalf.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8220;No, by  Allah, he (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of  Allah&#8217;s Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the spoils to me. I  sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and  this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam. </font></p>

This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it without greed, then one  is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and  will be like the one who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is  better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this  world.&#8221; So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some  money), Hakim refused to accept anything from him. Once &#8216;Umar called him (during his  Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, whereupon &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Haklm) his right which Allah has assigned to him)  from this Fai &#8216;(booty), but he refuses to take it.&#8221; So Haklm never took anything from  anybody after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

See what is the matter.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  has freed the captives without ransom.&#8221; He said (to him), &#8220;Go and set free those  two slave girls.&#8221; (Nafi added:) Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not perform the &#8216;Umra from  Al-Jarana, and if he had performed the &#8216;Umra, it would not have been hidden from  &#8216;Abdullah. </font></p>

He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the  fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle  was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather  tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  came to them and said, &#8220;What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that  which you have said?&#8221; The learned ones among them replied,&#8221; O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, &#8216;May  Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact  that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity  (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won&#8217;t  you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  your houses? By Allah, what you will return with, is better than what they are returning  with.&#8221; The Ansar replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we are satisfied&#8217; Then the  Prophet said to them.&#8221; You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be  patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in  Paradise).&#8221; (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient. </font></p>

When Al-Hurmuzan embraced Islam, &#8216;Umar said to him. &#8220;I would like to consult  you regarding these countries which I intend to invade.&#8221; Al-Hurmuzan said, &#8220;Yes,  the example of these countries and their inhabitants who are the enemies. of the Muslims,  is like a bird with a head, two wings and two legs; If one of its wings got broken, it  would get up over its two legs, with one wing and the head; and if the other wing got  broken, it would get up with two legs and a head, but if its head got destroyed, then the  two legs, two wings and the head would become useless. The head stands for Khosrau, and  one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to  go towards Khosrau.&#8221; So, &#8216;Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Numan bin Muqrin as  our commander. When we reached the land of the enemy, the representative of Khosrau came  out with forty-thousand warriors, and an interpreter got up saying, &#8220;Let one of you  talk to me!&#8221; Al-Mughira replied, &#8220;Ask whatever you wish.&#8221; The other asked,  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Al-Mughira replied, &#8220;We are some people from the Arabs; we  led a hard, miserable, disastrous life: we used to suck the hides and the date stones from  hunger; we used to wear clothes made up of fur of camels and hair of goats, and to worship  trees and stones. While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths,  Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves  a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord,  has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and  our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:&#8211; &#8220;Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e.  martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and  whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master.&#8221; (Al-Mughira, then blamed  An-Numan for delaying the attack and) An-Nu&#8217; man said to Al-Mughira, &#8220;If you had  participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he would not have  blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle  in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would  wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after  midday).&#8221; </font></p>

Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself and Aqil.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take.&#8221; He scooped money with both hands and poured it in  his garment and tried to lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, &#8220;Will  you order someone to help me in lifting it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Then will you yourself help me carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Al &#8216;Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not able  to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet &#8220;Will you order someone to help me  carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Then will you  yourself yelp me carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;No.&#8221; So, Al-&#8216;Abbas threw away  some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away.

By Allah, we shall never  replace you in it.&#8221; Then he asked, &#8220;Will you now tell me the truth if I ask you a  question?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Ab Li-AI-Qasim.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have you  poisoned this sheep?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What made you do  so?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would get  rid of you, and if you are a prophet then the poison would not harm you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the  prayer). Anas said, &#8220;It should be recited before bowing.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;So-and-so claims that you say that it should be recited after bowing.&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;He is mistaken.&#8221; Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet invoked  evil on the tribe of Bani-Sulaim for one month after bowing. &#8216; Anas Further said,  &#8220;The Prophet had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men well versed in the knowledge of the  Qur&#8217;an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled with them and martyred them, although  there was a peace pact between them and the Prophet I had never seen the Prophet so sorry  and worried about anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>the daughter of Abu Talib: I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the  day of the conquest of Mecca and found him taking a bath, and his daughter Fatima was  screening him. I greeted him and he asked, &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I, Um  Hani bint Abi Talib.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Welcome, O Um Hani.&#8221; When he had finished  his bath, he stood up and offered eight Rakat while dressed in one garment. I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My brother &#8216;Ali has declared that he will kill a man to whom I  have granted asylum. The man is so and-so bin Hubaira.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Hani! We will grant asylum to the one whom you have granted asylum.&#8221; (Um Hani  said, &#8220;That (visit) took place in the Duha (i.e. forenoon)). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali delivered a sermon saying, &#8220;We have no book to  read except the Book of Allah and what is written in this paper which contains verdicts  regarding (retaliation for) wounds, the ages of the camels (given as Zakat or as blood  money) and the fact that Medina is a sanctuary in between Air mountain to so-and-so  (mountain). So, whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it,  to such an innovator will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and  none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And whoever  (freed slave) takes as his master (i.e. befriends) other than his real masters will incur  the same (Curse). And the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the other  Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect will incur the same (Curse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Sahl and Muhaiyisa bin Mas&#8217;ud bin Zaid set  out to Khaibar, the inhabitants of which had a peace treaty with the Muslims at that time.  They parted and later on Muhaiyisa came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Sah! and found him murdered  agitating in his blood. He buried him and returned to Medina. &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sahl,  Muhaiyisa and Huwaiuisa, the sons of Mas&#8217;ud came to the Prophet and &#8216;Abdur Rahman intended  to talk, but the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Let the eldest of you speak.&#8221; as  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman was the youngest:. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman kept silent and the other two spoke. The  Prophet said, &#8220;If you swear as to who has committed the murder, you will have the  right to take your right from the murderer.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How should we swear if  we did not witness the murder or see the murderer?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the  Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an oath taken by men that it  was not they who committed the murder).&#8221; The!y said, &#8220;How should we believe in  the oaths of infidels?&#8221; So, the Prophet himself paid the blood money (of &#8216;Abdullah).

Abu Bakr threw back the pagans&#8217; covenant that year, and therefore, no  pagan performed the Hajj in the year of Hajj-ul-Wada&#8217; of the Prophets. </font></p>

They stipulated that  he would not stay for more than three days and would not enter it except with sheathed  arms and would not preach (Islam) to any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the  treaty between them. He wrote, &#8220;This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed  to.&#8221; The (Meccans) said, &#8220;If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the Apostle of  Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, &#8216;This  is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed to..&#8217; &#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;By Allah, I am Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of &#8216;Allah.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used not to write; so he asked &#8216;Ali to erase the expression of Apostle of  Allah. On that &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah I will never erase it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  (to &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Let me see the paper.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali showed him the paper, the Prophet  erased the expression with his own hand. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had entered Mecca and three  days had elapsed, the Meccans came to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Let your friend (i.e. the  Prophet) quit Mecca.&#8221; Ali informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and then he departed. </font></p>

The Prophet did not  raise his head from prostration till Fatima (i.e. his daughter) came and removed those  intestines from his back, and invoked evil on whoever had done (the evil deed). The  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, O Allah!

So, it is a sanctuary by  Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone  before me, and it was made legal for me only for an hour by daytime. So, it (i.e. Mecca)  is a sanctuary by Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorny bushes should  not be cut, and its game should not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should  not be picked up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should not be  uprooted,&#8221; On that Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except the Idhkhir,  because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people for their houses.&#8221; On that the  Prophet said, &#8220;Except the Idhkhir.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Peacemaking </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.049.855">Volume 3, Book 49, Number 855: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani  &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make  peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up;  Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so  Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i  detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, you  wish.&#8221; So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead  the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The  people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither  and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him.  The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised  his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the  Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the  prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &#8220;O people! When something happens to  you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women  only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217;,  (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards  him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned  to you (to continue)?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa  to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was said to the Prophet &#8220;Would that you see  Abdullah bin Ubai.&#8221; So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims  accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ubai, the latter said, &#8220;Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has  harmed me.&#8221; On that an Ansari man said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;By Allah! The smell of  the donkey of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is better than your smell.&#8221; On that a man from  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s tribe got angry for &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sake, and the two men abused each other which  caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with  sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in  this concern):&#8211; &#8220;And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace  between them.&#8221; (49.9) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;He who makes  peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a  liar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the people of Quba fought with each other till they  threw stones on each other. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was informed about it, he said, &#8220;Let  us go to bring about a reconciliation between them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following Verse: If a woman fears cruelty or desertion  on her husband&#8217;s part (i.e. the husband notices something unpleasant about his wife, such  as old age or the like, and wants to divorce her, but she asks him to keep her and provide  for her as he wishes). (4.128) &#8220;There is no blame on them if they reconcile on such  basis.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge  between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent got up and said, &#8220;He is  right. Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;My son  was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his  wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I  paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the  learned scholars who said, &#8220;Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to  be exiled for one year.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No doubt I will judge between you  according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your  son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile.&#8221; He then addressed somebody,  &#8220;O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death&#8221; So, Unais went  and stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If somebody innovates something  which is not in harmony with the principles of our religion, that thing is rejected.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the  people of Hudaibiya, Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it,  &#8220;Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; The pagans said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t write: &#8216;Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;, for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle asked Ali to rub it out, but Ali said, &#8220;I will not be the person to rub it  out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that  the Prophet and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that  they would enter with their weapons in cases. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 863: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet intended to perform &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with  them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was  written, the following was mentioned: &#8216;These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle agreed (to make peace).&#8217; They said, &#8220;We will not agree to this, for if we  believed that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Rub off (the words) &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; &#8220;,  but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the document and wrote, &#8216;This is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed upon:  No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of  Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him  and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the  latter wants to stay.&#8217; When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the  Meccans went to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as  the period (agreed to) has passed.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter  of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, &#8220;O Uncle! O  Uncle!&#8221; &#8216;Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take your  uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarrel ed about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have more  right to her as she is my uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is my uncle&#8217;s  daughter, and her aunt is my wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is my brother&#8217;s  daughter.&#8221; The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the  aunt was like the mother. He then said to &#8216;All, &#8220;You are from me and I am from  you&#8221;, and said to Ja&#8217;far, &#8220;You resemble me both in character and  appearance&#8221;, and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are our brother (in faith) and our freed  slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the &#8216;Umra but the pagans of  Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got  his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform &#8216;Umra the  following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca  except for the period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the &#8216;Umra in the following  year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the  pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl,  and the relatives of Ar-Rabi&#8217; requested the girl&#8217;s relatives to accept the Irsh  (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but they refused. So, they went  to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8221;; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi&#8217; be broken? No, by Him Who has  sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O  Anas! Allah&#8221;; law ordains retaliation.&#8221; Later the relatives of the girl agreed  and forgave her. The Prophet said, &#8220;There are some of Allah&#8217;s slaves who, if they  take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas  added, &#8220;The people agreed and accepted the Irsh.&#8221; </font></p>

If these killed those and those killed  these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for  their women, who would be left with me for their children?&#8221; Then Muawiya sent two  Quraishi men from the tribe of &#8216;Abd-i-Shams called &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah  bin &#8216;Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, &#8220;Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and  negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him.&#8221; So, they went to Al-Hasan and  talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;We, the offspring of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and  money only will appease them).&#8221; They said to Al-Hasan, &#8220;Muawiya offers you so  and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan said to them,  &#8220;But who will be responsible for what you have said?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will  be responsible for it.&#8221; So, what-ever Al-Hasan asked they said, &#8220;We will be  responsible for it for you.&#8221; So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya.  Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the  pulpit and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people  and once at Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali saying, &#8216;This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may  Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard the loud voices of some  opponents quarreling at the door. One of them was appealing to the other to deduct his  debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying, &#8220;By Allah I will not do  so.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out to them and said, &#8220;Who is the one who was swearing  by Allah that he would not do a favor?&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I am that person, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will give my opponent whatever he wishes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik from Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Kab bin Malik some  money. One day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices grew  very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b,&#8221; beckoning with his  hand as if intending to say, &#8220;Deduct half the debts.&#8221; So, Kab took half what the  other owed him and remitted the other half. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is a Sadaqa to be given  for every joint of the human body; and for every day on which the sun rises there is a  reward of a Sadaqa (i.e. charitable gift) for the one who establishes justice among  people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 871: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who  had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a water stream  which both of them used for irrigation. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.&#8221; The  Ansari became angry and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it because he is your  cousin?&#8221; On that the complexion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of anger) and  said (to Az-Zubair), &#8220;I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it  reaches the walls (surrounding the palms).&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Az-Zubair his  full right. Before that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for  Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah&#8217;s Apostle he gave Az-Zubair  his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah ! I think the  following Verse was revealed concerning that case: &#8220;But no by your Lord They can have  No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his  creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but  they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went  to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), &#8220;When you pluck the dates and  collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah&#8217;s  Apostle).&#8221; Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and sat on the dates and  invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, &#8220;Call your creditors and give them their  full rights.&#8221; So, I paid all my father&#8217;s creditors in full and yet thirteen extra  Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were &#8216;Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were  Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On  that he smiled and said, &#8220;Go to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and tell them about it.&#8221; They  said, &#8220;We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did what he  did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Ka&#8217;b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew  louder till Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he lifted the curtain  of his room and called Ka&#8217;b bin Malik saying, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b!&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Labbaik! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He beckoned to him with his hand suggesting that  he deduct half the debt. Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;I agree, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), &#8220;Get up and pay him the rest.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the  Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the  youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet  asked, &#8220;O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old  men?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone  over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; So, the Prophet gave it  to him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked  for Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed with  water drawn from the well in Anas&#8217;s house. A tumbler of it was presented to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his  right side. When the Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, &#8216;Umar was afraid that the  Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give it to Abu  Bakr who is sitting by your side.&#8221; But the Prophet gave it to the bedouin, who was to  his right and said, &#8220;You should start with the one on your right side.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a false oath to  deprive somebody of his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him.&#8221;  Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant,  and their oaths.&#8217; &#8230;&#8230;..(3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath came (to the place where &#8216;Abdullah was  narrating) and said, &#8220;What has Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you?  This verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin of mine. The  Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my claim). I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t have  witnesses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Let the defendant take an oath then.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He  will take a (false) oath immediately.&#8217; Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and  Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 692) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are three persons whom  Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs  shall be a severe punishment. They are: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he  withheld it from travelers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he  gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and  if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the &#8216;Asr  prayer and he said, &#8216;By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have  been given so much for my goods,&#8217; and somebody believes him (and buys them).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet then recited: &#8220;Verily! Those who purchase  a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their oaths.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of  the Prophet about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. The  Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;Let the water pass&#8217; but Az-Zubair refused to do so.  So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor.&#8221; On that the  Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, &#8220;Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your  aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of  anger) and he said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till  it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees.&#8221; Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah,  I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion&#8221;: &#8220;But no, by  your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When a man from the Ansar quarrelled with AzZubair, the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then let the water flow (to  the land of the others).&#8221; &#8220;On that the Ansari said, (to the Prophet), &#8220;It  is because he is your aunt&#8217;s son.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate  till the water reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let  the water go to the other&#8217;s land).&#8221; I think the following verse was revealed  concerning this event: &#8220;But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make  you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in  the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, ordering Zubair to be  moderate, said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for  your neighbor.&#8221; The Ansari said, &#8220;Is it because he is your aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On  that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the  pits around the trees.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said,  &#8220;By Allah, the following verse was revealed in that connection&#8221;: &#8220;But no,  by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another  sub-narrator), &#8220;The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet,  &#8216;Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits  around the trees,&#8217; as meaning up to the ankles.&#8221; </font></p>

On coming out of it, he saw a dog  panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, &#8216;This (dog) is suffering  from the same problem as that of mine. So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with  water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked  him for his (good) deed and forgave him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, there is a  reward for serving any animate.&#8221; </font></p>

Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people  (first)?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; So, he gave it to the boy. </font></p>

If she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without  constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, &#8220;If she had not taken handfuls  of its water&#8221;), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and  asked her, &#8216;May we settle at your dwelling?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, but you have no right to  possess the water.&#8217; They agreed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There are three types of people  whom Allah will neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered  for his goods so much more than what he is given, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. a man who takes a false oath after the &#8216;Asr prayer in  order to grab a Muslim&#8217;s property, and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. a man who with-holds his superfluous water. Allah will  say to him, &#8220;Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the  superfluity of what you had not created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Keeping horses may be a source  of reward to some (man), a shelter to another (i.e. means of earning one&#8217;s living), or a  burden to a third. He to whom the horse will be a source of reward is the one who keeps it  in Allah&#8217;s Cause (prepare it for holy battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or  a garden). He will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the  pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses one or two hills,  then all its foot-steps and its dung will be counted as good deeds for its owner; and if  it passes by a river and drinks from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed  for its owner even if he has had no intention of watering it then. Horses are a shelter  from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning his living so as not to ask  others, and at the same time he gives Allah&#8217;s right (i.e. Rakat) (from the wealth he earns  through using them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps horses  just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming the Muslims, his horses  will be a source of sins to him.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys, he  replied, &#8220;Nothing particular was revealed to me regarding </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a  fallen thing). The Prophet said, &#8220;Recognize its container and its tying material and  then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it  to him; otherwise use it as you like.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What about a lost  sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, your brother or the wolf.&#8221; The  man said &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why should you take  it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the  places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ali bin Abi Talib said: &#8220;I got a she-camel as my share  of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave me another  she-camel. I let both of them kneel at the door of one of the Ansar, intending to carry  Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet on marrying Fatima. A  goldsmith from Bam Qainqa&#8217; was with me. Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib was in that house  drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: &#8220;O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she  camels (and serve them to your guests).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels  and cut off their humps and opened their flanks and took a part of their livers.&#8221; (I  said to Ibn Shihab, &#8220;Did he take part of the humps?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He cut  off their humps and carried them away.&#8221;) &#8216;Ali further said, &#8220;When I saw that  dreadful sight, I went to the Prophet and told him the news. The Prophet came out in the  company of Zaid bin Haritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to  Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza looked up and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you only the slaves of  my forefathers?&#8217; The Prophet retreated and went out. This incident happened before the  prohibition of drinking.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me to distribute the  saddles and skins of the Budn which had slaughtered. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 497: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin Amir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet had given him sheep to distribute among  his companions and a male kid was left (after the distribution). When he informed the  Prophet of it, he said (to him), &#8220;Offer it as a sacrifice on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.498"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 498: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf  that Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would look after his  in Medina. When I mentioned the word &#8216;Ar-Rahman&#8217; in the documents, Umaiya said, &#8220;I do  not know &#8216;Ar-Rahman.&#8217; Write down to me your name, (with which you called yourself) in the  Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; So, I wrote my name &#8216; &#8216;Abdu &#8216;Amr&#8217;. On the day (of  the battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill to protect him.  Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, &#8220;(Here is)  Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!&#8221; So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal  to follow us (&#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I left  Umaiya&#8217;s son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the son and insisted on  following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they approached us, I told him to kneel down,  and he knelt, and I laid myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing  their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his sword. (The sub  narrator said, &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman used to show us the trace of the wound on the back of  his foot.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 499: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar.  When the man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The Prophet asked  him, &#8220;Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;(No),  we exchange two Sa&#8217;s of bad dates for one Sa of this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or  exchange three Sa&#8217;s for two.&#8221; On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do so, as it is  a kind of usury (Riba) but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy  Janib with the money&#8221;. The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by weight.  (See Hadith No. 506). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 500: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Ka&#8217;b bin Malik from his father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala&#8217;. One of our  slavegirls saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with it. My  father said to the people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat it till I ask the Prophet about it (or till I  send somebody to ask the Prophet).&#8221; So, he asked or sent somebody to ask the Prophet,  and the Prophet permitted him to eat it. &#8216;Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I admire  that girl, for though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 501: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet owed somebody a camel of a certain age. When he  came to demand it back, the Prophet said (to some people), &#8220;Give him (his due).&#8221;  When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found none, but found a camel one  year older. The Prophet said, &#8220;Give (it to) him.&#8221; On that, the man remarked,  &#8220;You have given me my right in full. May Allah give you in full.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;The best amongst you is the one who pays the rights of others  generously.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.502"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 502: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet demanding his debts and behaved  rudely. The companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to  them), &#8220;Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) has the right to  speak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;Give him a camel of the same age as that of  his.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is only a camel that is older  than his.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give (it to) him, for the best amongst you is  he who pays the rights of others handsomely.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.503"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 503: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing  Islam, came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their properties  and their captives. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;The most beloved statement to me  is the true one. So, you have the option of restoring your properties or your captives,  for I have delayed distributing them.&#8221; The narrator added, Allah&#8217;s Apostle c had been  waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, &#8220;We choose  our captives.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised  Allah as He deserved, and said, &#8220;Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you  with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, whoever amongst  you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to  his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can  do so.&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor  for Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know who amongst you  has agreed and who hasn&#8217;t. Go back and your chiefs may tell us your opinion.&#8221; So, all  of them returned and their chiefs discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their  chiefs) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given up their  shares gladly and willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 504: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding  a slow camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and asked,  &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What  is the matter, (why are you late)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am riding a slow camel.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Do you have a stick?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He said,  &#8220;Give it to me.&#8221; When I gave it to him, he beat the camel and rebuked it. Then  that camel surpassed the others thenceforth. The Prophet said, &#8220;Sell it to me.&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;It is (a gift) for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it  to me. I have bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it till  Medina.&#8221; When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my house). The Prophet  said, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I Sad, &#8220;I have married a widow.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Why have you not married a virgin to fondle with each other?&#8221; I said, &#8220;My  father died and left daughters, so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to  look after them).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well done.&#8221; When we reached Medina, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra  money.&#8221; Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator said): Jabir  added, &#8220;The extra Qirat of Allah&#8217;s Apostle never parted from me.&#8221; The Qirat was  always in Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s purse. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 505r: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I want to give up myself to you.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;Marry her to me.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;We agree to marry her to you with what you know of the Qur&#8217;an by  heart.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 505t: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle deputed me to keep Sadaqat (al-Fitr) of  Ramadan. A comer came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff (of the Sadaqa)  (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will take you to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am needy and have many dependents, and I am in great  need.&#8221; I released him, and in the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8220;What did  your prisoner do yesterday?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The person complained  of being needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming again.&#8221; I  believed that he would show up again as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told me that he would return.  So, I waited for him watchfully. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of  foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, &#8220;I will definitely take you to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I  promise I will not come back again.&#8221; I pitied him and let him go. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8220;What did  your prisoner do.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He complained of his great  need and of too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, he told you a lie and he will return.&#8221; I waited for him  attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the  foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, &#8220;I will surely take you to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  as it is the third time you promise not to return, yet you break your promise and  come.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Forgive me and) I will teach you some words with which Allah  will benefit you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What are they?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whenever you  go to bed, recite &#8220;Ayat-al-Kursi&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-l-Haiy-ul Qaiyum&#8217;  till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who  will stay with you and no satan will come near you till morning. &#8221; So, I released  him. In the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What did your prisoner do  yesterday?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He claimed that he would teach me some words by which  Allah will benefit me, so I let him go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are  they?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He said to me, &#8216;Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi  from the beginning to the end &#8212;- Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum&#8212;-.&#8217; He  further said to me, &#8216;(If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with  you, and no satan will come near you till morning.&#8217; (Abu Huraira or another sub-narrator)  added that they (the companions) were very keen to do good deeds. The Prophet said,  &#8220;He really spoke the truth, although he is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you  were talking to, these three nights, O Abu Huraira?&#8221; Abu Huraira said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Satan.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Bilal brought Barni (i.e. a kind of dates) to the  Prophet and the Prophet asked him, &#8220;From where have you brought these?&#8221; Bilal  replied, &#8220;I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of it for one Sa of  Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet said,  &#8220;Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba (usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)!  Don&#8217;t do so, but if you want to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for  money and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar  and Beeruha&#8217; (garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated opposite  the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink from its sweet  water. When the following Divine Verse were revealed: &#8216;you will not attain righteousness  till you spend in charity of the things you love&#8217; (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah says in His Book, &#8216;You will not  attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you love,&#8217; and verily, the  most beloved to me of my property is Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope  for its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it wherever you like.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle appreciated that and said, &#8220;That is perishable wealth, that is perishable  wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to distribute it among your  relatives.&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So, Abu  Talha distributed it among his relatives and cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The  Prophet said: &#8220;That is a profitable wealth,&#8221; instead of &#8220;perishable  wealth&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a  dead man was brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the  deceased. He said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; The people replied in the negative. He said,  &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So, he led his funeral  prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead  his funeral prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8221;Three  Dinars.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said  (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any  wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  (&#8220;Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.&#8217;, He (refused to pray and) said, &#8220;Then pray  for your (dead) companion.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead his  funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488h: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;An Israeli man asked another  Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former  replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;I want a surety.&#8217; The  former replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;You are right,&#8217; and  lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished  his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of  the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it,  inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e.  sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. &#8216;O Allah! You  know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety  from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your  guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a  Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so  that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.&#8217; Saying  that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he  went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the  creditor&#8217;s country. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a  ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which  his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found  his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one  thousand Dinars to him and said, &#8216;By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I  could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8217; The  lender asked, &#8216;Have you sent something to me?&#8217; The debtor replied, &#8216;I have told you I  could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.&#8217; The lender said, &#8216;Allah has  delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your  one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;In the verse: To every one We have  appointed &#8216; (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one&#8217;s) heirs (4.33).&#8217; (And regarding the verse) &#8216;And  those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;When the  emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the  latter&#8217;s relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the  Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: &#8216;And  to everyone We have appointed heirs&#8217; (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the  pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;The verse: To  those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation  and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible  to assign something in one&#8217;s testament to the person who had the right of inheriting  before. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik, &#8220;Have you ever heard that the  Prophet said, &#8216;There is no alliance in Islam?&#8217; &#8221; He replied, &#8220;The Prophet made  alliance between Quarish and the Ansar in my house.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might  lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; When the people  replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he  asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (refused to lead the  prayer and) said, &#8220;Lead the prayer of your friend.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then led his funeral  prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet said (to me), &#8220;If the money of  Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it.&#8221; The Prophet had breathed his  last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr  announced, &#8220;Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us.&#8221; I went to  Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet promised me so and so.&#8221; Abu Bakr gave me a  handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then  said, &#8220;Take twice the amount you have taken (besides).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.494"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could  remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam.  Not a single day passed but Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the  evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant.  When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara  tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;My people  have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my  Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &#8220;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be  turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and  kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help  people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at  your home.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of  Quraish saying to them, &#8220;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned  out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with  Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the  people during their troubles?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&#8217;s guarantee of protection  and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &#8220;Advise Abu Bakr to  worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and  not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&#8221;  Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in  his house and did not pray or recite Qur&#8217;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr  had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea  and started praying and reciting Qur&#8217;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the  pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a  softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&#8217;an. This horrified the  pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &#8220;We  have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house,  but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his  house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&#8217;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead  our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his  Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as  we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&#8217;s  public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said,  &#8220;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide  by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &#8216;Arabs saying  that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not  respect it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied  with Allah&#8217;s protection.&#8221; At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said  to his companions, &#8220;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty  land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two  ,Harras.&#8221; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina,  and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared  for emigration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to  emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you  really expect that?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr  postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&#8217;s Apostle and fed two camels which he  had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  he would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to repay his debt?&#8221; If he was informed that  he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he  would tell the Muslims to offer their friend&#8217;s funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet  wealthy through conquests, he said, &#8220;I am more rightful than other believers to be  the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the  repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his  heirs. &#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Penalty of Hunting while on Pilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.029.047"></a>Volume 3, Book 29, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), &#8220;I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions&#8217; help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, &#8220;Where did you leave the Prophet ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I left him at Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah&#8217;s Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.&#8217; I added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said &#8220;We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle till I reached him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.&#8221; So he did. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, &#8220;We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.&#8221; So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, &#8220;Eat it.&#8221; While some others said, &#8220;Do not eat it.&#8221; So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, &#8220;Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).&#8221;</p>

He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together.&#8221; So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: &#8220;How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?&#8221; So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager&#8217;s meat, and when they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), &#8216;How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?&#8217; So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, &#8220;Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;Then eat what is left of its meat.&#8221;</p>

Allow me to tell you what Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, &#8216;Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, &#8216;Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.&#8217; &#8220;Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact.&#8221; Abu Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said, (&#8216;Amr said) &#8216;O Abu Shuraih!

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 27:</p>
<h3 align="center">Minor Pilgrammage (Umra)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.027.001"></a>Volume 3, Book 27, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The performance of) &#8216;Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ikrima bin Khalid asked Ibn &#8216;Umar about performing &#8216;Umra before Hajj. Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;There is no harm in it.&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar also said, &#8216;The Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra before performing Hajj.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ikrima bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar the same (as above).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8216;Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard &#8216;Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don&#8217;t you hear what Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman is saying?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What does he say?&#8221; &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;He says that Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed four &#8216;Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any &#8216;Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha (whether the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra in Rajab). She replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8220;Four times. 1. &#8216;Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da when the pagans hindered him; 2. &#8216;Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. &#8216;Umra from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the war booty.&#8221; I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, &#8220;How many times did he perform Hajj?&#8221; He (Anas) replied, &#8220;Once. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas (about the Prophet&#8217;s &#8216;Umra) and he replied, &#8220;The Prophet performed &#8216;Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da, and another &#8216;Umra in combination with his Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet performed four &#8216;Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da except the (one) &#8216;Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His &#8216;Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another &#8216;Umra with his Hajj.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Masruq, &#8216;Ata&#8217; and Mujahid (about the &#8216;Umra of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). They said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da before he performed Hajj.&#8221; I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da twice before he performed Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn &#8216;Abbas named her but &#8216;Ata&#8217; forgot her name), &#8216;What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.&#8217; He said (to her), &#8216;Perform &#8216;Umra when Ramadan comes, for &#8216;Umra in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward),&#8217; or said something similar.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so. Hadn&#8217;t I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; (&#8216;Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. The day of &#8216;Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.&#8221; When it was the night of Hasba, he sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan&#8217;im and I assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed &#8216;Umra.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Aus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let &#8216;Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform &#8216;Umra from At-Tan&#8217;im.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. &#8216;Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (&#8216;Ali) said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle has assumed it.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for &#8216;Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, &#8220;Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?&#8221; The Prophet heard that and said, &#8220;Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and &#8216;Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!&#8221; So, he ordered &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan&#8217;im. Thus she performed &#8216;Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;sham met the Prophet at Al-&#8216;Aqaba (Jamrat-ul &#8216;Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform &#8216;Umra before Hajj.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Some of the people assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of &#8216;Arafat. I complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.&#8221; So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub-narrator adds: He (&#8216;AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and &#8216;Umra) but I am returning with one only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan&#8217;im, assume Ihram (and after performing &#8216;Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if &#8216;Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, &#8220;Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as &#8216;Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.&#8221; The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, &#8220;I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am not praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the &#8216;Umra as well.&#8221; So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and said, &#8220;Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.&#8221; We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, &#8220;Have you finished?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji&#8217;rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), &#8216;What do you order me to perform in my &#8216;Umra?&#8217; So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. &#8216;Umar said to me, &#8216;Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked about &#8216;Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sa&#8217;i between Safa and Marwa). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham Ibn &#8216;Urwa from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was a youngster, I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet. &#8220;What about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: &#8216;It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from &#8216;Aisha): &#8220;The Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah&#8217;s sight.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Isma&#8217;il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed &#8216;Umra and we too performed &#8216;Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow.&#8221; A friend of his asked him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Aufa), &#8220;Did the Prophet enter the Ka&#8217;ba (during that &#8216;Umra)?&#8221; He replied in the negative. Then he said, &#8220;What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?&#8221; He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said, &#8220;(He said) &#8216;Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Ibn &#8216;Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba seven times and then offered a two Rak&#8217;at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; And we asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, &#8220;He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 21:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha&#8217; while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, &#8220;Have you intended to perform the Hajj?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, &#8216;With what intention have you assumed Ihram?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, &#8220;You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram.&#8221; So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of &#8216;Umar who said, &#8220;If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asma&#8217;, whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, &#8220;May Allah bless His Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, &#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed &#8216;Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka&#8217;ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 24:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet arrived at Mecca, some boys of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abdul Muttalib went to receive him, and the Prophet made one of them ride in front of him and the other behind him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 25:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle left for Mecca, he used to pray in the mosque of Ash-Shajra, and when he returned (to Medina), he used to pray in the middle of the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa and used to pass the night there till morning.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas: The Prophet never returned to his family from a journey at night. He</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 28:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above, but mentioned &#8220;the walls of Medina&#8221; instead of &#8220;the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin Umar agrees with Anas.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 30:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; saying, &#8220;The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors.&#8221; (2.189)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 31:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one&#8217;s needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 32:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn &#8216;Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers together. Then he said, &#8220;I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is  the best deed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed  times.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next in goodness?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To be good  and dutiful to your parents.&#8221; I further asked, what is next in goodness?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To participate in Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; I did not ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 42: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is no Hijra (i.e.  migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good  intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth  immediately. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.043"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 43: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(That she said), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We consider Jihad  as the best deed. Should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The best  Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet&#8217;s  tradition and is accepted by Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 44: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Instruct me  as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not find such  a deed.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the  battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break  your fast?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;But who can do that?&#8221; Abu- Huraira added,  &#8220;The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse  while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 45: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Somebody asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is the best  among the people?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied &#8220;A believer who strives his utmost in  Allah&#8217;s Cause with his life and property.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Allah and  leaving the people secure from his mischief.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.046"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 46: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The example of a  Mujahid in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8211; and Allah knows better who really strives in His Cause&#8212;-is  like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Allah guarantees that He will admit the  Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his  home safely with rewards and war booty.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 47: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who  would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, once  visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, &#8220;What causes  you to smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Some of my followers who (in a  dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause (on board a ship) amidst this  sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the  thrones).&#8221; (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet  used.) Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um  Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Some  of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause,&#8221; repeating the  same dream. Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of  them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are amongst the first ones.&#8221; It happened that she  sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu&#8217;awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she  disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 48: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and His  Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted  Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah&#8217;s Cause or remains in the land  where he is born.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the  people with the is good news?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Paradise has one-hundred grades which  Allah has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each  of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask  Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of  Paradise.&#8221; (i.e. The sub-narrator added, &#8220;I think the Prophet also said, &#8216;Above  it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the  rivers of Paradise.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 49: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two men came to me (in a  dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house,  better of which I have never seen. One of them said, &#8216;This house is the house of  martyrs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 50: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor (of fighting) in  Allah&#8217;s Cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is  in it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.051"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 51: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A place in Paradise as small as a  bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world).&#8221; He  also said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is  better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 52: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause  in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it.&#8221;  </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.053"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 53: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody who dies and finds good from  Allah (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the  whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on seeing the superiority of  martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and get killed again (in Allah&#8217;s  Cause).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor  (of fighting) in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the  world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you  is better than all the world and whatever is in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared  to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with  light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 54: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is!  Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I  cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya&#8217;  (army-unit) setting out in Allah&#8217;s Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love  to be martyred in Al1ah&#8217;s Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then  get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get  martyred. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.055"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 55: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;Zaid took  the flag and was martyred, and then Ja&#8217;far took the flag and was martyred, and then  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took  the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and Allah made him victorious.&#8221;  The Prophet further added, &#8220;It would not please us to have them with us.&#8221; Aiyub,  a sub-narrator, added, &#8220;Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, &#8216;It would not p ease  them to be with us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.056"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 56: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Haram said, &#8220;Once the Prophet slept in my house  near to me and got up smiling. I said, &#8216;What makes you smile?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Some of my  followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings  on thrones.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; So the  Prophet invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and  told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said,  &#8220;Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are among the first  batch.&#8221; Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband &#8216;Ubada  bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval  expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to  Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus  she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 57: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim  to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them,  &#8220;I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me.&#8221; So he went  ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message  of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal  uncle said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful.&#8221; After  that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up  to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think another man was  saved along with him).&#8221; Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met  their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite,  &#8220;Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made  us pleased &#8221; Later on this Quranic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Allah for  forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam  Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 58: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundab bin Sufyan: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In one of the holy Battles a finger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (got  wounded and) bled. He said, &#8220;You are just a finger that bled, and what you got is in  Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 59: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul  is! Whoever is wounded in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8230;.and Allah knows well who gets wounded in His  Cause&#8230;.will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wound having the color of blood but  the scent of musk.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 60: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him,  &#8220;I asked you about the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you  told me that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are tested in  this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 61: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of  Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought  against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt.  Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221; On the day of Uhud when the Muslims  turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologize to You for what these  (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have  done.&#8221; Then he advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said &#8220;O Sad bin Muadh ! By  the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain  of) Uhud,&#8221; Later on Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he  (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his  body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister  could recognize him by his fingers.&#8221; We used to think that the following Verse was  revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who  have been true to their covenant with Allah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (33.23) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>His sister Ar-Rubbaya&#8217; broke a front tooth of a woman and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered for retaliation.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever spends two things in  Allah&#8217;s Cause, will be called by all the gate-keepers of Paradise who will be saying, &#8216;O  so-and-so! Come here.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Such persons will  never be destroyed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I hope you will be one of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;Nothing  worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly  blessings which will be conferred on you.&#8221; Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures.  He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?&#8221; The  Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the  people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked,  &#8220;Where is the present questioner?&#8221; &#8220;Do you think wealth is good?&#8221; he  repeated thrice, adding, &#8220;No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like  what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals  because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks  are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and  urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How  excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent  in Allah&#8217;s Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it  legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against  him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

I am coming just now,&#8217; and went on perfuming  himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people  fled from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, &#8216;Clear the way for me to fight the enemy.  We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. How bad the habits you  have acquired from your enemies!&#8221; </font></p>

He himself was not in the state of Ihram. They saw an opener before he could see  it. When they saw the opener, they did not speak anything till Abu Qatada saw it. So, he  rode over his horse called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they  refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and slaughtered it. He ate of  its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating. When they met the  Prophet (they asked him about it) and he asked, &#8220;Have you some of its meat (left)  with you?&#8221; Abu Qatada replied, &#8220;Yes, we have its leg with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet took and ate it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of  three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a  means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are  a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a  long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area  of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his  benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its  dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river  and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will  get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he  is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for  Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked  about donkeys, he replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this  unique, comprehensive Verse: &#8220;Then anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s)  weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s) weight of  evil, shall see it.&#8217; (101.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I called on Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari and said to him,  &#8220;Relate to me what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  accompanied him on one of the journeys.&#8221; (Abu Aqil said, &#8220;I do not know whether  that journey was for the purpose of Jihad or &#8216;Umra.&#8221;) &#8220;When we were  returning,&#8221; Jabir continued, &#8220;the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever wants to return earlier  to his family, should hurry up.&#8217; We set off and I was on a black red tainted camel having  no defect, and the people were behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped  suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;O Jabir, wait!&#8217; Then he  hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, &#8216;Will you  sell the camel?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went  to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the  pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, &#8216;This is your camel.&#8217; He came out and  started examining the camel and saying, &#8216;The camel is ours.&#8217; Then the Prophet sent some  Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, &#8216;Give it to Jabir.&#8217; Then he asked, &#8216;Have you taken  the full price (of the camel)?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8216;Both the price and  the camel are for you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

What  makes you smile?&#8221; He replied, (I dreamt that) some people amongst my followers were  sailing on the green sea in Allah&#8217;s Cause, resembling kings on thrones.&#8221; She said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O  Allah! Let her be one of them.&#8221; Then he (slept again and woke up and) smiled. She  asked him the same question and he gave the same reply. She said, &#8220;Invoke Allah to  make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8221;You will be amongst the first group of them; you  will not be amongst the last.&#8221; Later on she married &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit and then she  sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu&#8217;awiya&#8217;s wife (for Jihad).

Paradise is  for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Allah&#8217;s Cause, with his hair unkempt  and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied  with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post  with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is  not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Choose one of your boy  servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.&#8221; So, Abu Talha took me letting me  ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Allah&#8217;s  Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! I seek  refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness  and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men.&#8221; Then we  reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty  of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while  she was a bride. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him  till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,&#8217; where her menses were over and he took her  for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle folding a cloak  round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him)  He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the  camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and  said, &#8220;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us.&#8221; Then he looked at  Medina and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains  a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of  Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures).&#8221; </font></p>

Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;You  are amongst them.&#8221; He slept again and then woke up smiling and said the same as  before twice or thrice.

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned to their  camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would  follow and kill with his sword any pagan going alone. He said, &#8220;Nobody did his job  (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed,  he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;I  shall accompany him (to watch what he does)&#8221; Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he  stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided  to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground  directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the  sword and killed himself.

The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, &#8216;I will find  out his reality for you.&#8217; So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and  hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end  towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed  himself.&#8221; when Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A man may seem to the people as if he were  practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the  Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the  people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to my house while two girls were  singing beside me the songs of Bu&#8217;ath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the  Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet reclined on the bed and turned his  face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me and said protestingly,  &#8220;Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle turned  his face towards him and said, &#8220;Leave them.&#8221; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I  waved the two girls to go away and they left. It was the day of &#8216;Id when negroes used to  play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah&#8217;s Apostle or he himself  asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he  let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry  on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!&#8221; When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough.  I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The &#8216;Prophet was the best and the bravest amongst the  people. Once the people of Medina got terrified at night, so they went in the direction of  the noise (that terrified them). The Prophet met them (on his way back) after he had found  out the truth. He was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and a sword was  hanging by his neck, and he was saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid! Don&#8217;t be afraid!&#8221; He  further said, &#8220;I found it (i.e. the horse) very fast,&#8221; or said, &#8220;This horse  is very fast.&#8221; (Qastala-ni) </font></p>

You have asked Allah pressingly.&#8221; The Prophet was clad in his armor at that  time. He went out, saying to me: &#8220;There multitude will be put to flight and they will  show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense)  and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter (than their worldly failure).&#8221;  (54.45-46) Khalid said that was on the day of the battle of Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a miser and the one  who gives in charity, is like the example of two men wearing iron cloaks so tightly that  their arms are raised forcibly towards their collar-bones. So, whenever a charitable  person wants to give in charity, his cloak spreads over his body so much so that it wipes  out his traces, but whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron  cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his hands gets connected to  his collar-bones. Abu Huraira heard the Prophet saying. &#8220;The miser then tries to  widen it but in vain.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam  and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to hand it over  to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to  Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory  over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said  after reading t, &#8216;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present  here, in order to ask him about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in  Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that  had been concluded between Allah&#8217;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said,  Caesar&#8217;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and  we were admitted into Ceasar&#8217;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a  crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his  translator. &#8216;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a  prophet.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;I replied, &#8216;I am the nearest relative to him.&#8217; He  asked, &#8216;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He is my cousin,&#8217;  and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &#8216;Let him  come nearer.&#8217; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said  to his translator, &#8216;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who  claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a  liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it  shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his  translator, &#8216;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a  noble family amongst us.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same  before him? &#8216;I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he  claimed what he claimed? &#8216; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a  king?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&#8217; I replied,  &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by  day)?&#8217; I replied,&#8217; They are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace  his (the Prophet&#8217;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&#8217;. I replied,  &#8216;No. &#8216; He said, &#8216;Does he break his promises? I replied, &#8216;No, but we are now at truce with  him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Other than the  last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &#8216;Have you ever had  a war with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What was the outcome of your battles with  him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;  He said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and  not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to  worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what  is entrusted to us.&#8217; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &#8216;Say to him: I  ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact,  all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you  whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the  negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man  was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever  blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a  person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about  Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the  negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted  to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people  followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the  followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true  faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who,  after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was  in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters  and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether  he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles;  they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he  fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory  is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to  worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your  fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep  promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a  prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that  he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the  earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go  immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;  &#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  was read. Its contents were:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most  Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to  Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then,  I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe;  embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this  invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your  nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we  worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none  of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness  that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his  speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him,  and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned  out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them,  &#8216;Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha&#8217;s (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) affair has gained power. This is the King  of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I remained low and  was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I  disliked it &#8221; </font></p>

But the Prophet  asked for &#8216;Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he  ordered them to bring &#8216;Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes  were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;We will fight  with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what  Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands  (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

So, when the day  dawned, the Jews came out with their bags and spades. When they saw the Prophet; they  said, &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; The Prophet said, Allahu&#8211;Akbar! (Allah is  Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight)  then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned.&#8221; </font></p>

Beef was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering)  and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Somebody said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered (a  cow) on behalf of his wives.&#8221; </font></p>

And no doubt, everyone among you  will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Allah. If one is in doubt as to the  legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a  time when you will not find such a man.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle The  Prophet met me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation and it  had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked me, &#8220;What is wrong with  the camel?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;It has got tired.&#8221; So. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came from  behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and  going ahead of them. Then he asked me, &#8220;How do you find your camel (now)?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Will you sell it to me?&#8221; I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the  only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it to  me then.&#8221; I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I  reached Medina. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a bridegroom,&#8221; and  requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the  people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I  informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had  married a matron. He said, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t you married a virgin who would have played  with you, and you would have played with her?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My  father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that  I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them.  So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners.&#8221; When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me  its price and gave me the camel itself as well. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me,  Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad somewhere saying, &#8216;Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh. There you  will find a lady with a letter. Take the letter from her.&#8217; &#8221; So, we set out and our  horses ran at full pace till we got at Ar-Rawda where we found the lady and said (to her).  &#8220;Take out the letter.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or else we will take off your clothes.&#8221;  So, she took it out of her braid. We brought the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  contained a statement from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to some of the Meccan pagans informing  them of some of the intentions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Don&#8217;t hasten to give  your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not  belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who  would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking  blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I  did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief)  to Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle, said, &#8220;Hatib has told you the truth.&#8221; Umar  said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Hatib participated in the battle of Badr, and who knows, perhaps Allah  has already looked at the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day (of the battle) of Badr, prisoners of  war were brought including Al-Abbas who was undressed. The Prophet looked for a shirt for  him. It was found that the shirt of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai would do, so the Prophet let him  wear it. That was the reason why the Prophet took off and gave his own shirt to &#8216;Abdullah.  (The narrator adds, &#8220;He had done the Prophet some favor for which the Prophet liked  to reward him.&#8221;) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Where is  &#8216;Ali?&#8221; He was told that &#8216;Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to  his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The  Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Should I fight them till they become like us  (i.e. Muslim)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go to them patiently and calmly till you  enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them,  for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than  possessing red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

Then they  killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after they were  Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their  pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet  cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey  were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina).

So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty cavalry men from  the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on  horses, so the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my  chest, he said, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and rightly guided man.&#8217;  &#8221; Jarir proceeded towards that house, and dismantled and burnt it.

I, too, went out along with them,  pretending to look for it. They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too,  entered along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept its keys in a  small window where I could see them. When those people slept, I took the keys and opened  the gate of the fort and came upon Abu Rafi and said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I  proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back,  pretending to be a helper. I said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of my voice. He asked  me, &#8216;What do you want; woe to your mother?&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What has happened to you?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know who came to me and hit me.&#8217; Then I drove my sword into his belly and  pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and  went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot.  I came to my companions and said, &#8216;I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.&#8217;  So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant pf Hijaz. Then  I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till we came upon the Prophet and  informed him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not screen himself from me since my  embracing Islam, and whenever he saw me he would receive me with a smile.

Make him firm and make him a guiding and a rightly-guided man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander  of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He  instructed them, &#8220;Stick to your place, and don&#8217;t leave it even if you see birds  snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and  made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.&#8221; Then  the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes  revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair  said, &#8220;The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what  are you waiting for now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;Have you forgotten what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;By Allah! We will go to the people  (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.&#8221; But when they went to  them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle in their rear  was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred  seventy men from us. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his  companions had caused the &#8216;Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and  seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, &#8220;Is Muhammad present amongst these  people?&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?&#8221; He asked again thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?&#8221; He then returned to his  companions and said, &#8220;As for these (men), they have been killed.&#8221; &#8216;Umar could  not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), &#8220;You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of  Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy  is still there.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;Our victory today is a counterbalance to  yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in  turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I  did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed&#8221; After that he  started reciting cheerfully, &#8220;O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle  What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.&#8221;  (Then) Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to his companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Says Allah is our Helper  and you have no helper.&#8221; </font></p>

Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an  uproar at night.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the  mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me. I said to him,  &#8220;Woe to you! What brought you here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The she-camels of the  Prophet have been taken away.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Who took them?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Ghatafan and Fazara.&#8221; So, I sent three cries, &#8220;O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah  !&#8221; so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains hear  me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing  arrows at them saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8221;; and today perish the mean  people!&#8221; So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could  drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so  send some people to chase them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, you have  gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being  entertained by their folk.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith was holding the  reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, &#8216;I  am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8217; On that  day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 281: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the  leadership of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin Umar Al-Khattab.  They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between &#8216;Usfan, and Mecca, and their news  reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who  were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had  eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, &#8220;These are the dates  of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), &#8220;and continued following their tracks When &#8216;Asim and his  companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them.  The infidels said to them, &#8220;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you  that we will not kill any one of you&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya  said, &#8220;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O  Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they  martyred &#8216;Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise  and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when  the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the  third (of the captives) said, &#8220;This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go  with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.&#8221; So,  they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed  him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and  all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith  bin &#8216;Amir bin Naufal bin &#8216;Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amir on  the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Iyyad said that the  daughter of Al-Harith had told him, &#8220;When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he  borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of  mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and  the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my  face and said, &#8216;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&#8217; By Allah, I  never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of  grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in  Mecca.&#8221; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &#8220;It was a boon Allah bestowed  upon Khubaib.&#8221; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside  its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed  him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I been afraid that you would  think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah,  kill them all with no exception.&#8221; (He then recited the poetic verse):&#8211; &#8220;I being  martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause, For my killing is for  Allah&#8217;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&#8221;  Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any  Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer (before being  killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he  was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to  them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed,  they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be  recognized. (That was because) &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the  battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over  Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from  his flesh. </font></p>

Ibn Saiyad  was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn  Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the  date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf!&#8221; (And this was his name). Ibn  Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman let him to himself, he would have  revealed the reality of his case.&#8221; Then the Prophet got up amongst the people,  glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, &#8220;I warn you about  him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and  Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his  nation of.

Where will you stay tomorrow?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has Aqil left for us any  house?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e.  Al-Muhassab, where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to  heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani Hashim on the terms  that they would not deal with the members of the is tribe or give them shelter.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Khaif means valley.&#8221;) (See Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aslam: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called  Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or  other specified animals). He said to him, &#8220;O Hunai! Don&#8217;t oppress the Muslims and  ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is  responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few  sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  bin &#8216;Auf and the livestock of (&#8216;Uthman) bin &#8216;Affan, for if their livestock should perish,  then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own  a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and  appeal for help saying, &#8216;O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!&#8217; Would I then  neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass  rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims&#8217; treasury). By Allah, these  people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the  pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in  their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my  custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah&#8217;s Cause, I would not have turned  even a span of their land into a Hima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (to us), &#8221; List the names of those  people who have announced that they are Muslims.&#8221; So, we listed one thousand and five  hundred men. Then we wondered, &#8220;Should we be afraid (of infidels) although we are one  thousand and five hundred in number?&#8221; No doubt, we witnessed ourselves being  afflicted with such bad trials that one would have to offer the prayer alone in fear. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and  he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, &#8220;This (man) is from the  people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man fought violently till he  got wounded. Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man whom you described as being  from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;He will go to the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Some people were on the point of doubting  (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone  said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and  committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, &#8220;Allah is Greater!  I testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8221; Then he ordered Bilal to announce  amongst the people: &#8216;None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Allah may support this  religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usiya and Bani  Lihyan came to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they requested  him to support them with some men to fight their own people. The Prophet supported them  with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of  piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the  (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi&#8217;r-Ma&#8217;ana where they betrayed and  martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan  for one month in the prayer. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used  to recite a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi said, &#8220;We were in the company of  the Prophet at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and  sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the  cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset  and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one  camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few  horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s  Permission). On that the Prophet said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so,  if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the  Prophet ), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have  no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied,  &#8220;If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if  Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won&#8217;t  use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering  with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the  Ethiopians.&#8221; </font></p>

So I proceeded with  one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the  Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand  and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and a  guiding and rightly-guided man.&#8221; Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and  burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did  not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel  (covered with tar).&#8221; So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of  Ahmas five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman  said to Abu Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, &#8220;I perfectly know what  encouraged your leader (i.e. &#8216;Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: Once the Prophet  sent me and Az-Zubair saying, &#8216;Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will  find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested  the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, &#8216;Hatib has not given me any letter.&#8217; We  said to her. &#8216;Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.&#8217; So she took it  out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t hurry in  judging me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is  increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions  but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody  there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and  property).&#8217; The Prophet believed him. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib&#8217;s)  neck as he has done hypocrisy.&#8217; The Prophet said, (to &#8216;Umar), &#8216;Who knows, perhaps Allah  has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman added, &#8220;So this is what encouraged him (i.e.  Ali).&#8221; </font></p>

During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the Prophet and (his) wife fell down.  Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel  quickly) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get  hurt?&#8221; The Prophet replied,&#8221;No, but take care of the lady.&#8221; Abu Talha  covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his  garment, and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and both of  them (i.e. the Prophet and his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The  Prophet said, &#8220;We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising our  Lord.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying this statement till he entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Aufa &#8220;Did the Prophet make a  will?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;How is it then that the making  of a will has been enjoined on people, (or that they are ordered to make a will)?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;The Prophet bequeathed Allah&#8217;s Book (i.e. Quran).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the presence of &#8216;Aisha some people mentioned that the  Prophet had appointed &#8216;Ali by will as his successor. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;When did he  appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my  lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not  even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abu Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca,  (&#8216;Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already  migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad  bin Khaula).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May I will all my property (in  charity)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then may I will half of it?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. I said, &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes, one third, yet  even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to  leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake will be considered  as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth. Allah may  lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by  you.&#8221; At that time Sad had only one daughter. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I recommend that people reduce the proportion of what they  bequeath by will to the fourth (of the whole legacy), for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;One-third, yet even one third is too much.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fell sick and the Prophet paid me a visit. I said to him,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I invoke Allah that He may not let me expire in the land whence I  migrated (i.e. Mecca).&#8221; He said, &#8220;May Allah give you health and let the people  benefit by you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to will my property, and I have only one  daughter and I want to will half of my property (to be given in charity).&#8221; He  said,&#8221; Half is too much.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then I will one third.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;One-third, yet even one-third is too much.&#8221; (The narrator added, &#8220;So the  people started to will one third of their property and that was Permitted for them.&#8221;)  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted  (his son) to his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, &#8220;The son of the slave-girl of  Zam&#8217;a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody.&#8221; So during the year of the  Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, &#8220;This is my brother&#8217;s son whom my  brother entrusted to me.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;s got up and said, &#8220;He is my brother and  the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Then both of  them came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is my brother&#8217;s  son whom my brother entrusted to me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said, &#8220;This is my  brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Abu bin Zam&#8217;a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and  for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation).&#8221; Then the Prophet said to his wife  Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a, &#8220;Screen yourself from this boy,&#8221; when he saw the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones. She  was asked, &#8220;Who has done so to you, so-and-so? So-and-so?&#8221; Till the name of the  Jew was mentioned, whereupon she nodded (in agreement). So the Jew was brought and was  questioned till he confessed. The Prophet then ordered that his head be crushed with  stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The custom (in old days) was that the property of the  deceased would be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), they  would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled from that custom whatever  He wished and fixed for the male double the amount inherited by the female, and for each  parent a sixth (of the whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the  husband a half or a fourth. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind  of charity is the best?&#8221; He replied. &#8220;To give in charity when you are healthy  and greedy hoping to be wealthy and afraid of becoming poor. Don&#8217;t delay giving in charity  till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, &#8216;Give so much to so-and-so and  so much to so-and so,&#8217; and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to  so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors).&#8221; </font></p>

This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting as fruits), and  whoever takes it with </font></p>

By Him Who has sent you  with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you till I die.&#8221;  Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something but he refused to accept  anything from him. Then &#8216;Umar called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has  ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it.&#8221; Thus Hakim did not ask  anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he died&#8211;may Allah bestow His mercy upon him.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the  meaning of the Quranic Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with  the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&#8221; (4.2-3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said, &#8220;It is about a female orphan under the  guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,  and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So  they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full  appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later  on the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding  women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl  was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving  her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for  lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman  instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he  had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her  justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights. </font></p>

I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity.&#8221;  The Prophet; said, &#8220;Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees  on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor  bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar gave it in charity,  and it was for Allah&#8217;s Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for  travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it  reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no  intention of becoming wealthy by its means. </font></p>

So you can use it as Allah directs you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to  which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and  I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives.&#8221; On that Abu Talha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

When the time of plucking the  date-fruits came, I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! you know  that my father was martyred on Uhud&#8217;s day and owed much debt, and I wish that the  creditors would see you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and collect the various kinds of  dates and place them separately in heaps&#8221;&#8216; I did accordingly and called him. On  seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the  Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over  it and said, &#8220;Call your companions (i.e. the creditors).&#8221; Then he kept on  measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father&#8217;s debts. By Allah, it would  have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken  a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and  I looked at the heap where Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date  had been taken thereof. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.050.874">Volume 3, Book 50, Number 874: </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to the Treaty (of  Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to  them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and  would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition  and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the  Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin &#8216;Amr.  Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a  Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba  bin Abu Muait who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came  to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for  Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine  them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send  them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers,  Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa: Aisha told me, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine them according to  this Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants  test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (60.10-12) Aisha said,  &#8220;When any of them agreed to that condition Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her, &#8216;I have  accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8217; He would only say that, but, by Allah he never  touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge  of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words  (only).&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Urwa: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for emancipation and at  that time she had not paid any part of her price. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go to your  masters and if they agree that I will pay your price (and free you) on condition that your  Wala&#8217; will be for me, I will pay the money.&#8221; Buraira told her masters about that, but  they refused, and said, &#8220;If &#8216;Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your Wala will  be for us.&#8221; Aisha informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle of that and he said to her, &#8220;Buy and  manumit Buraira as the Wala&#8217; will go to the manumitted.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and beat it and  prayed for Allah&#8217;s Blessings for it. The camel became so fast as it had never been before.  The Prophet then said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He again said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I sold  it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that  camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and  when I went to him) he said, &#8220;I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift  for you.&#8221; (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in  expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to  Medina). </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ansar said to the Prophet, &#8220;Divide our date-palms between us and our emigrant  brothers.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Ansar said to the emigrants,  &#8220;You may do the labor (in our gardens) and we will share the fruits with you.&#8221;  The emigrants said, &#8220;We hear and obey.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Uqba bin Amir: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;From among all the conditions which you have to fulfill,  the conditions which make it legal for you to have sexual relations (i.e. the marriage  contract) have the greatest right to be fulfilled.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to work on the fields more than the other Ansar, and we used to rent the land  (for the yield of a specific portion of it). But sometimes that portion or the rest of the  land did not give any yield, so we were forbidden (by the Prophet ) to follow such a  system, but we were allowed to rent the land for money. </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not practice  Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you do not want to buy, in order  to deceive the people). No Muslim should offer more for a thing already bought by his  Muslim brother, nor should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim.  A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister (i.e. another Muslim  woman) in order to take her place herself.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s apostle! I ask you by Allah  to judge My case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent, who was more learned than  he, said, &#8220;Yes, judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws, and allow me to  speak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He (i .e. the bedouin or the other  man) said, &#8220;My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son  should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred  sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me  that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of  this (man) must be stoned to death.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and  the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled  for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt,  stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade (1) the meeting of the caravan (of goods) on the way, (2) and  that a residing person buys for a bedouin, (3) and that a woman stipulates the divorce of  the wife of the would-be husband, (4) and that a man tries to cause the cancellation of a  bargain concluded by another. He also forbade An-Najsh (see Hadith 824) and that one  withholds the milk in the udder of the animal so that he may deceive people on selling it.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubai bin Kab: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Moses the Apostle of Allah,&#8221; and then he narrated the  whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8220;Did not I tell you that you can have  no patience with me.&#8221; (18.72). Moses then violated the agreement for the first time  because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything,  the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the  third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied.  The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me.&#8221; (18.73) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him.&#8221; (18.74) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of falling and Khadir  set it up straight.&#8221; (18.77) </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Urwa: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;Buraira came to me and said, &#8216;My people (masters) have written the  contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be paid in yearly installments,  one Uqiyya per year; so help me.&#8221; Aisha said (to her), &#8220;If your masters agree, I  will pay them the whole sum provided the Wala will be for me.&#8221; Buraira went to her  masters and told them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from them  while Allah&#8217;s Apostles was sitting. She said, &#8220;I presented the offer to them, but  they refused unless the Wala&#8217; would be for them.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that and  &#8216;Aisha told him about It, he said to her, &#8220;Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that  her Wala&#8217; will be for them, as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha did so. After  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said,  &#8220;What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws?  Any condition which is not in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such  conditions. Allah&#8217;s Rules are the most valid and Allah&#8217;s Conditions are the most solid.  The Wala is for the manumitted.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar&#8217;s hands and feet, Umar got up  delivering a sermon saying, &#8220;No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a contract with the Jews  concerning their properties, and said to them, &#8216;We allow you (to stand in your land) as  long as Allah allows you.&#8217; Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked at  night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except  those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my  mind to exile them.&#8221; When Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu  Al-Haqiq&#8217;s came and addressed &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers, will you exile us  although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our  properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, i.e.: What will  your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you  night after night?&#8221; The Jew replied, &#8220;That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then drove them  out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel  saddles and ropes, etc.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out at the time of  Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &#8220;Khalid bin  Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place  called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&#8221; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive  the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached  him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing  till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them  (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their  best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; (i.e. the  she-camel&#8217;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&#8217; has become stubborn!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she  was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;By the Name of Him  in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will  respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till  he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little  water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all  its water and complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of  his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started  and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with  satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&#8217;i came with  some persons from his tribe Khuza&#8217;a and they were the advisers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who  would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &#8220;I  left Kab bin Luai and &#8216;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and  they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against  you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We  have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &#8216;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened  Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with  them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e.  the &#8216;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish  will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at  least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose  Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am  sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I will  inform them of what you have said.&#8221; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said,  &#8220;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we  will disclose to you if you should like.&#8221; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted  that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said,  &#8220;Relate what you heard him saying.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I heard him saying  so-and-so,&#8221; relating what the Prophet had told him. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Urwa bin Mas&#8217;ud got up and said, &#8220;O people! Aren&#8217;t you the sons? They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Am I not the father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Do you mistrust me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you  know that I invited the people of &#8216;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my  relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a  reasonable proposal, you&#8217;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&#8221; They said,  &#8220;You may meet him.&#8221; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The  Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &#8220;O Muhammad!  Won&#8217;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone  amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse  should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified  people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&#8221; Hearing  that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &#8220;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?&#8221; Urwa said, &#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is Abu  Bakr.&#8221; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for  the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&#8221;  Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&#8217;s beard as he was talking  while Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and  wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet,  Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &#8220;Remove  your hand from the beard of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Urwa raised his head and asked,  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba.&#8221; Urwa  said, &#8220;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your  treachery?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and  took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him,  &#8220;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything  of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of  the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand  of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if  he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they  would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower  their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to  his people and said, &#8220;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar,  Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as  much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would  fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his  face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he  performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke,  they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of  respect.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable  offer, so please accept it.&#8221; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &#8220;Allow me  to go to him,&#8221; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his  companions, Allah&#8217;s Ap le I said, &#8220;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that  respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of  him.&#8221; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they  were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! It is  not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; When he returned to his  people, he said, &#8216;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with  stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to  go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet  said, &#8220;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&#8221; Mikraz started talking to the  Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &#8220;Now the matter has become easy.&#8221;  Suhail said to the Prophet &#8220;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &#8220;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most  Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Beneficent,&#8217; by Allah, I  do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write  previously.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name  of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Write: By  Your Name O Allah.&#8221; Then he dictated, &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle has concluded.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, if we knew that you are  Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with  you. So, write: &#8220;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah! I am  Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that  he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e.  by letting him and his companions perform &#8216;Umra.)&#8221; The Prophet said to Suhail,  &#8220;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) so that we may  perform Tawaf around it.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not (allow you this  year) so as not to give chance to the &#8216;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we  will allow you next year.&#8221; So, the Prophet got that written. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Suhail said, &#8220;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to  you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;Glorified be  Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim?  While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &#8216;Amr came from the valley of  Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &#8220;O  Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall  return Abu Jandal to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The peace treaty has not been  written yet.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;I will never allow you to keep him.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, do.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do.: Mikraz said, &#8220;We allow  you (to keep him).&#8221; Abu Jandal said, &#8220;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the  pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&#8217;t you see how much I have suffered?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said,  &#8220;I went to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&#8217; The Prophet  said, &#8216;Yes, indeed.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t  you tell us that we would go to the Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but  did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;So you  will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; &#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;I went to Abu  Bakr and said, &#8216;O Abu Bakr! Isn&#8217;t he truly Allah&#8217;s Prophet?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Indeed, he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by  Allah, he is on the right.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba  and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the  Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;You will go to Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf  around it.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said, &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I performed many good deeds as  expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&#8217; &#8220;) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to his  companions, &#8220;Get up and&#8217; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&#8221; By  Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them  got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&#8217;s attitudes towards  him. Um Salama said, &#8220;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried  out? Go out and don&#8217;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and  call your barber to shave your head.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to  anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who  shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their  sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that  there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet  ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:&#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them  . . .&#8221; (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan  married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to  Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his  pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Abide by the promise you gave us.&#8221;  So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached  Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to  one of them, &#8220;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&#8221; The other  drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &#8220;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried  it many times.&#8221; Abu Bair said, &#8220;Let me have a look at it.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran  away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him  he said, &#8220;This man appears to have been frightened.&#8221; When he reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.&#8221;  Abu Basir came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill  your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me  from them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he  would be, should he only have supporters.&#8221; When Abu Basir heard that he understood  that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the  seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined  Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till  they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish  heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and  took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him  for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions)  promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet  sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir&#8217;s companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine  Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in  the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had  pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of  ignorance.&#8221; (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess  (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to  write: &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,&#8221; and  prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine  the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the  Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated  (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their  wives, &#8216;Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the  daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza&#8217;i. Later on Mu&#8217;awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the  other.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah  revealed: &#8220;And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you  have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those  whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).&#8221;  (60.11) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a  compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the  pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We  have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim  emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to  return Abu Basir. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Amra: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation.  &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala&#8217;  will be for me.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said  to her, &#8220;Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who  manumits.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;What about those  people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever stipulates such  conditions as are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he  stipulated a hundred such conditions.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has ninety-nine names, i.e. one-hundred minus one,  and whoever knows them will go to Paradise.&#8221; (Please see Hadith No. 419 Vol. 8) </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 50, Number 895: </p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Khattab got some land in Khaibar and he went to the Prophet to consult him  about it saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle got some land in Khaibar better than which I have  never had, what do you suggest that I do with it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you  like you can give the land as endowment and give its fruits in charity.&#8221; So Umar gave  it in charity as an endowment on the condition that would not be sold nor given to anybody  as a present and not to be inherited, but its yield would be given in charity to the poor  people, to the Kith and kin, for freeing slaves, for Allah&#8217;s Cause, to the travelers and  guests; and that there would be no harm if the guardian of the endowment ate from it  according to his need with good intention, and fed others without storing it for the  future.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and  Ubaidullah bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>About the story of &#8216;Aisha and their narrations were similar  attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about &#8216;Aisha, and the Divine  Inspiration was delayed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for &#8216;Ali and Usama to consult them in  divorcing his wife (i.e. &#8216;Aisha). Usama said, &#8220;Keep your wife, as we know nothing  about her except good.&#8221; Buraira said, &#8220;I cannot accuse her of any defect except  that she is still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family&#8217;s dough which the  domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband).&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me  by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not known about my  family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not  know anything except good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 806: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the  garden where Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as he wanted to hear  secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft  decorated sheet was lying on his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet hiding  behind the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, &#8220;O Saf, this is  Muhammad.&#8221; Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious), the Prophet  said, &#8220;If she had left him undisturbed, he would have revealed his reality.&#8221;  (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 807: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wife of Rifa&#8217;a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;I was Rifa&#8217;a&#8217;s wife, but he divorced me and it was a final irrevocable divorce. Then  I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent.&#8221; The Prophet asked her &#8216;Do  you want to remarry Rifa&#8217;a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your  present husband.&#8221; Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin  Al-&#8216;As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what  this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.808"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 808: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith:  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a  woman came and said, &#8220;I suckled &#8216;Uqba and his wife.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba said to her, &#8220;I  do not know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me.&#8221; He then sent  someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they did not know that she had  suckled their daughter. Then &#8216;Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it.  The Prophet said to him, &#8220;How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that  both of you were suckled by the same woman)?&#8221; So, he divorced her and she was married  to another (husband). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 809: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine  Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle but now there is no longer any more  (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice publicly, so we will trust  and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account  about what he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but we will  not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that  his intentions were good. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the  people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed  (Paradise).&#8221; Then another funeral procession passed by and the people talked badly of  the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  was asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said it has been affirmed for both?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;The testimony of the people (is accepted), (for) the believer are  Allah&#8217;s witnesses on the earth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 811: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of  disease and the people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and a funeral  procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been  affirmed&#8221; (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people praised  the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed.&#8221; (Paradise). Then another  funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has  been affirmed (Paradise).&#8221; Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people  talked badly of the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; I asked  Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  said what the Prophet said. He said, &#8216;Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good  character is attested by four persons.&#8217; We asked the Prophet, &#8216;If there were three  witnesses only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even three.&#8217; We asked, &#8216;If there were two only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  two.&#8217; But we did not ask him about one witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 812: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow  him. He said, &#8220;Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; Aflah replied, &#8220;You were suckled by my brother&#8217;s wife  with my brother&#8217;s milk.&#8221; I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, and he said, &#8220;Allah  is right, so permit him to visit you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 813: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said about Hamza&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;I am not  legally permitted to marry her, as foster relations are treated like blood relations (in  marital affairs). She is the daughter of my foster brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet told her uncle that  once, while the Prophet was in her house, she heard a man asking Hafsa&#8217;s permission to  enter her house. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I think the man is Hafsa&#8217;s  foster uncle.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is a man asking the  permission to enter your house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I think the man is  Hafsa&#8217;s foster uncle.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster  uncle) would he be allowed to visit me?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Yes, he would,  as the foster relations are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs).&#8221; </font></p>

Who is this (man)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;My foster brothers&#8221;  He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Be sure about your foster brothers, as fostership is only valid  if it takes place in the suckling period (before two years of age).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him  the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the  lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by  women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city  of Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off  was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing  I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my  necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because  of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the  back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in  weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the  difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the  camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I  found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I  went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and  come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Safwan bin Mu&#8217;attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the  army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me,  and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, &#8220;Inna  lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).&#8221; He  made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs  of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by  the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was  meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the  leader of the false accusers was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to  Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged  statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not  receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got  sick. But he would come, greet and say, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I did not know anything of  what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the  Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the  call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to  our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs in the open  country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah  stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of)  Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Hanata (you there) didn&#8217;t you hear what they said?&#8217; Then she told me  the rumors of the false accusers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I requested  him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I  Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8216;What are the  people talking about?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry much about this matter. By  Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the  women would forge false news about her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Glorified be Allah! Are the people  really taking of this matter?&#8217; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till  morning. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when  he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e.  &#8216;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&#8217;  &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and  there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you  the truth.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &#8216;O Burair. Did you ever see  anything which roused your suspicions about her?&#8217; Buraira said, &#8216;No, by Allah Who has sent  you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of  immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&#8217; On that day  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Who will support me to punish that  person (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my  family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person  about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my  company.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! by  Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will  chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will  fulfill your order.&#8217; On that Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this  incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said,  &#8216;By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill  him.&#8217; On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada), &#8216;By Allah! you are a  liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.&#8217; On  this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other,  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they  became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did  my tears stop, nor could I sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for  two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were  sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I  allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this  state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they  forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited  Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His  Apostle) and then said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you  are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin,  then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and  asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8217; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished  his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I  requested my father to reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I  do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; I said to my mother, &#8216;Talk to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  on my behalf.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the  Quran. I said. &#8216;I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and  that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you  that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I  confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would  believe me. By Allah, I don&#8217;t compare my situation with you except to the situation of  Joseph&#8217;s father (i.e. Jacob) who said, &#8216;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that  which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the  other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought  that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior  to be talked of in the Holy Qur&#8217;an. I had hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a dream in  which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not got up and nobody  had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So, there  overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being  inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping  like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  over, he was smiling and the first word he said, &#8216;Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has  declared your innocence.&#8217; My mother told me to go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I replied, &#8216;By  Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!  They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .&#8221; (24.11) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr,  who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, &#8216;By Allah, I  will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.&#8217; But Allah  later revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those who are good and wealthy among you  swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah&#8217;s  Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you?  Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said,  &#8216;Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,&#8217; and resumed helping Mistah whom he  used to help before. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the  Prophet&#8217;s wife about me saying, &#8216;What do you know and what did you see?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By  Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&#8221; Aisha further added &#8220;Zainab  was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet&#8217;s love), yet Allah protected her  (from being malicious), for she had piety.&#8221; </font></p>

This was  said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece of land between me and a man from the  Jews who denied my right. I took him to the Prophet. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8216;Do you  have an evidence?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, &#8216;Take an oath.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He will surely take an oath and take my property unjustly.&#8221; So,  Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant and their oaths . . . &#8221; (3.77) </font></p>

He  said, &#8216;He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed in connection with me.  There was a dispute between me and another man about something and the case was filed  before Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8216;Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to  take an oath.&#8217; I said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring for nothing.&#8217;  The Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab (other&#8217;s) property, then  Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him.&#8217; Then Allah revealed its confirmation.

If anyone of us saw another man over  his wife, would he go to search for a proof.&#8221; The Prophet went on saying,  &#8220;Produce a proof or else you would get the legal punishment (by being lashed) on your  back.&#8221; The Prophet then mentioned the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book).

How do you ask the people  of the Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Quran) which was revealed to His Prophet is  the most recent information from Allah and you recite it, the Book that has not been  distorted? Allah has revealed to you that the people of the scriptures have changed with  their own hands what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed  Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit thereby.&#8221; Ibn  Abbas added: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the knowledge revealed to you sufficient to prevent you from  asking them?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations  prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Allah&#8217;s limits and  orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got  seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have  to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them  (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started making a hole in the bottom of  the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have  to get water.&#8217; Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves,  but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants  should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in  their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, &#8220;Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he  got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to our  house and I said, (addressing the dead &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be merciful to  you. I testify that Allah has blessed you.&#8217; The Prophet said to me, &#8220;How do you know  that Allah has blessed him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;I do not know O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my  parents be sacrificed for you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards Uthman, by Allah he has  died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Allah, although I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do  not know what will be done to him.&#8217; Um Al-Ala added, &#8216;By Allah I shall never attest the  piety of anybody after him. And what Allah&#8217;s Apostles said made me sad.&#8221; Um Al-Ala  further said, &#8220;Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for Uthman. So I  went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about it, he said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his  deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Muslim women! None of you should  look down upon the gift sent by her she-neighbour even if it were the trotters of the  sheep (fleshless part of legs).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said to me, &#8220;O my nephew! We used to see the  crescent, and then the crescent and then the crescent in this way we saw three crescents  in two months and no fire (for cooking) used to be made in the houses of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.  I said, &#8220;O my aunt! Then what use to sustain you?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The two  black things: dates and water, our neighbors from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to  present Allah&#8217;s Apostle some of their milk and he used to make us drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I shall accept the invitation even  if I were invited to a meal of a sheep&#8217;s trotter, and I shall accept the gift even if it  were an arm or a trotter of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 743: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent for a woman from the emigrants and she had  a slave who was a carpenter. The Prophet said to her &#8220;Order your slave to prepare the  wood (pieces) for the pulpit.&#8221; So, she ordered her slave who went and cut the wood  from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit,  the woman informed the Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send  that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 744: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.745"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 745: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us in this house of ours and  asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.746"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 746: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran  after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who  slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (The narrator confirms  that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas,  &#8220;Did the Prophet; eat from it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He ate from it.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 747: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated As-Sa&#8217;b bin Jaththama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An onager was presented to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the place  called Al-Abwa&#8217; or Waddan, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the  signs of sorrow on the giver&#8217;s face he said, &#8220;We have not rejected your gift, but we  are in the state of Ihram.&#8221; (i.e. if we were not in a state of Ihram we would have  accepted your gift, Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 748: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to look forward for the days of my  (&#8216;Aisha&#8217;s) turn to send gifts to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to please him. </font></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 749: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said: Um Hufaid, Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217;s aunt sent some  dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The  Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The mastigar was eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and if it had  been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 750: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would  ask whether it was a gift or Sadaqa (something given in charity). If he was told that it  was Sadaqa, he would tell his companions to eat it, but if it was a gift, he would hurry  to share it with them. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.751"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 751: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some meat was brought to the Prophet and it was said that  the meat had been given in charity to Buraira. He said, &#8220;It was Sadaqa for Buraira  but a gift for us.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.752"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 752: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I intended to buy Buraira but her masters stipulated that  her Wala should be for them. When the Prophet was told about it, he said to me, &#8220;Buy  and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; Once Buraira was given some  meat, and the Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I said, &#8220;It has been given to  Buraira in charity.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is sadaqa for her but a gift for us.&#8221;  Buraira was given the option (to stay with her husband or to part with him). AbdurRahman  (a sub-narrator) wondered, &#8220;Was her husband a slave or a free man?&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba  (another sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I asked &#8216;Abdur-Rahman whether her husband was a slave  or a free man. He replied that he did not know whether he was a slave or a free man.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.753"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 753: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um &#8216;Atiyya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet went to &#8216;Aisha and asked her whether she  had something (to eat). She said that she had nothing except the mutton which Um &#8216;Atiyya  had sent to (Buraira) in charity. The Prophet said that it had reached its destination  (i.e. it is no longer an object of charity.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.754"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 754: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to send gifts to the Prophet on the day of  my turn. Um Salama said: &#8220;My companions (the wives of the Prophet Other than Aisha)  gathered and they complained about it. So I informed the Prophet about it on their behalf,  but he remained silent. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.755"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 755: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet he stood up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and  said, &#8220;Then after: Your brethren have come to you with repentance and I see it  logical to return to them their captives; so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a  favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you like to stick to his share till we give him  his right from the very first Fai (war booty) (1) which Allah will bestow on us, then (he  can do so).&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;We do that (to return the captives) willingly  as a favor for your sake.&#8221; </font></p>

So, my father went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;I have given a gift to my son from &#8216;Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered  me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8216;Have you  given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons?&#8217; He replied in the negative. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.&#8217; My father then returned  and took back his gift.&#8221; </font></p>

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

He then asked him,  &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months continuously&#8221; He replied in the  negative. The Prophet then asked him, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He  replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came with a basket full of dates. The  Prophet said to the man, &#8220;Take it and give it in charity (as an expiation of your  sin).&#8221; The man said &#8220;Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle?

So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut  them and distribute them among them, but said, &#8220;I will come to you tomorrow  morning.&#8221; So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the  date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all  the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened.

He said to them,  &#8220;This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to  me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the  property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return  except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly.

The Prophet  asked him, &#8220;Will you sell us (a sheep) or give it as a present?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;I will sell you (a sheep).&#8221; The Prophet bought a sheep and it was slaughtered.  The Prophet ordered that its liver and other abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the  Prophet gave every person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of that; he gave all those  of them who were present; and kept the shares of those who were absent.The Prophet then  put its meat in two huge basins and all of them ate to their fill, and even then more food  was left in the two basins which were carried on the camel (or said something like it). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah  will save all the parts of his body from the (Hell) Fire as he has freed the body-parts of  the slave.&#8221; Said bin Marjana said that he narrated that Hadith to &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain  and he freed his slave for whom &#8216;Abdullah bin Ja&#8217;far had offered him ten thousand Dirhams  or one-thousand Dinars. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 694: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the best deed?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To believe in Allah and to fight for His Cause.&#8221; I then asked,  &#8220;What is the best kind of manumission (of slaves)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The  manumission of the most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;If I cannot afford to do that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Help the weak or do good for a  person who cannot work for himself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If I cannot do that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a charitable deed for  your own good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ordered us to free slaves at the time of solar  eclipses. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 696: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were ordered to free slaves at the time of lunar  eclipses. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 697: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits a slave owned by  two masters, should manumit him completely (not partially) if he is rich after having its  price evaluated.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.698"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 698: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever frees his share of a  common slave and he has sufficient money to free him completely, should let its price be  estimated by a just man and give his partners the price of their shares and manumit the  slave; otherwise (i.e. if he has not sufficient money) he manumits the slave  partially.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.699"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 699: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  slave, then it is essential for him to get that slave manumitted&#8217; completely as long as he  has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay the price of the other  shares (after the price of the slave is evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the  slave partially in proportion to his share. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 700: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>as above BRIEFLY. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.701"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 701: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who manumits his share of a  slave and has money sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave&#8217;s price (justly  estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price to the other  co-owners).&#8221; Nafi&#8217; added, &#8220;Otherwise the slave is partially free.&#8221; Aiyub is  not sure whether the last statement was said by Nafi&#8217; or it was a part of the Hadith. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.702"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 702: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or  female slaves owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of the  slave. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say in such a case, &#8220;The manumitted should manumit the slave  completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of the price of that slave (which is  to be justly estimated) and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares  and the slave is freed (released from slavery).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar narrated this verdict from  the Prophet. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 704: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees his portion of a  common slave should free the slave completely by paying the rest of his price from his  money if he has enough money; otherwise the price of the slave is to be estimated and the  slave is to be helped to work without hardship till he pays the rest of his price.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 705: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has accepted my invocation to  forgive what whispers in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it to action or utter  it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol. 8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 706: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The (reward of) deeds depend on  intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he intends. So, whoever  migrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his migration will be for Allah and His Apostle,  and whoever migrated for worldly benefits or for marrying a woman, then his migration will  be for what he migrated for.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 1, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 707: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave set out intending  to embrace Islam they lost each other on the way. The slave then came while Abu Huraira  was sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Your slave has come  back.&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Indeed, I would like you to witness that I have  manumitted him.&#8221; That happened at the time when Abu Huraira recited (the following  poetic verse):&#8211; &#8216;What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us  From the land of Kufr (disbelief). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 708: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:&#8211; &#8216;What a long  tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).&#8217;  I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I went to the Prophet and gave the  pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the  Prophet who remarked, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  manumit him for Allah&#8217;s Sake,&#8221; and so I freed him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave came intending to  embrace Islam, they lost each other on the way. (When the slave showed up) Abu Huraira  said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I make you witness that the slave is free for Allah&#8217;s  Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 710: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad bin Abi  Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody, telling him that the  boy was his own (illegal) son. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle went (to Mecca) at the time of the  Conquest, Sad took the son of the slavegirl of Zam&#8217;a to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also brought  &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a with him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is the son of my brother  &#8216;Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam&#8217;a&#8217; slave-girl and he was born on his  bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and noticed much  resemblance (to &#8216;Utba). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a as he  was born on the bed of your father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to  observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy&#8217;s resemblance to &#8216;Utba and  Sauda was the wife of the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man amongst us declared that his slave would be freed  after his death. The Prophet called for that slave and sold him. The slave died the same  year. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her  Wala&#8217; would be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), &#8220;Manumit her  as her Wala&#8217; will be for the one who pays the price.&#8221; So, I manumitted her. The  Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either staying with her husband or  leaving him. She said, &#8220;Even if he gave me so much money, I would not stay with  him,&#8221; and so she preferred her freedom to her husband. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some men of the Ansar asked for the permission of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8220;Allow us to give up the ransom from our nephew Al-&#8216;Abbas. The  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Do not leave (even) a Dirham (of his ransom).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 715: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father told me that Hakim bin Hizam manumitted  one-hundred slaves in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance and slaughtered one-hundred  camels (and distributed them in charity). When he embraced Islam he again slaughtered  one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred slaves. Hakim said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in  the prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of righteousness?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;You have embraced Islam along with all those good deeds you did.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 716: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet and they requested him to return their properties and captives. The Prophet stood  up and said to them, &#8220;I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the  most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the  prisoners as I have delayed their distribution.&#8221; The Prophet had waited for them for  more than ten days since his arrival from Ta&#8217;if. So, when it became evident to them that  the Prophet was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, &#8220;We choose  our prisoners.&#8221; The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah  as He deserved and said, &#8220;Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with  repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you  likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his  share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then  he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives).&#8221; The people unanimously said,  &#8220;We do that (return the captives) willingly.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;We do not  know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders  forward us your decision.&#8221; So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter  with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly  given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about the captives  of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that &#8216;Abbas said to the Prophet, &#8220;I paid for my ransom and  Aqil&#8217;s ransom.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Aun: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my  letter that the Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they  were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting  men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives; the Prophet got  Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn &#8216;Umar had told him the above narration and that  Ibn &#8216;Umar was in that army. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu  Said said, &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Barli Al-Mustaliq and we  captured some of the &#8216;Arabs as captives, and the long separation from our wives was  pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus interruptus. We asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle  (whether it was permissible). He said, &#8220;It is better for you not to do so. No soul,  (that which Allah has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will  definitely come, into existence.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever  since I heard, three things, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, These  people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; When the  Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;These are the  Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) of our folk.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had a slave-girl from that  tribe, and the Prophet said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael  (the Prophet).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ma&#8217;rur bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave,  too, was wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing similar  cloaks). He replied, &#8220;Once I abused a man and he complained of me to the Prophet .  The Prophet asked me, &#8216;Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?&#8217; He added, &#8216;Your slaves  are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one&#8217;s brethren  under one&#8217;s control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them  with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot  bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When your servant brings your meals  to you then if he does not let him sit and share the meals, then he should at least give  him a mouthful or two mouthfuls of that meal or a meal or two meals, as he has prepared  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Everyone of you  is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is  responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his  charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s house and responsible for her charges; and  the servant is a guardian of his master&#8217;s property and is responsible for his  charge.&#8221; I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet  also said, &#8220;A man is a guardian of his father&#8217;s property and responsible for his  charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 735: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in  her writing of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid anything of  it. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go back to your masters, and if they agree that I will pay  the amount of your writing of emancipation and get your Wala&#8217;, I will do so.&#8221; Buraira  informed her masters of that but they refused and said, &#8220;If she (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) is  seeking Allah&#8217;s reward, then she can do so, but your Wala&#8217; will be for us.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said to her, &#8220;Buy and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217;  is for the liberator.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and said, &#8220;What about the  people who stipulate conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever imposes  conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions will be invalid,  even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Allah&#8217;s conditions (Laws) are the  truth and are more solid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 736: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha wanted to buy a slave-girl in order to manumit her.  The girl&#8217;s masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; would be for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to  &#8216;Aisha), &#8220;What they stipulate should not stop you, for the Wala&#8217; is for the  liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 737: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Buraira came (to &#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;I have made a  contract of emancipation with my masters for nine Uqiyas (of gold) to be paid in yearly  installments. Therefore, I seek your help.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If your masters agree,  I will pay them the sum at once and free you on condition that your Wala&#8217; will be for  me.&#8221; Buraira went to her masters but they refused that offer. She (came back) and  said, &#8220;I presented to them the offer but they refused, unless the Wala&#8217; was for  them.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard of that and asked me about it, and I told him about it.  On that he said, &#8220;Buy and manumit her and stipulate that the Wala&#8217; should be for you,  as Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up  amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah, and said, &#8216;Then after: What about some  people who impose conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? So, any condition  which is not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions.  Allah&#8217;s ordinance is the truth, and Allah&#8217;s condition is stronger and more solid. Why do  some men from you say, O so-and-so! manumit the slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily,  the Wala is for the liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Buraira went to Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers  to seek her help in her emancipation Aisha said to her, &#8220;If your masters agree, I  will pay them your price in a lump sum and manumit you.&#8221; Buraira mentioned that offer  to her masters but they refused to sell her unless the Wala&#8217; was for them. &#8216;Aisha told  Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He said, &#8220;Buy and manumit her as the Wala&#8217; is for the  liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 739: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdul Wahid bin Aiman: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to &#8216;Aisha and said, &#8220;I was the slave of Utba  bin Abu Lahab. &#8220;Utba died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr  who manumitted me. The sons of &#8216;Utba stipulated that my Wala&#8217; should be for them.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Buraira came to me and she was given the writing of emancipation by her  masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that  her masters would not sell her unless her Wala&#8217; was for them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I  am not in need of that.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that, or he was told about it, he  asked &#8216;Aisha about it. &#8216;Aisha mentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet said,  &#8220;Buy and manumit her and let them stipulate whatever they like.&#8221; So, &#8216;Aisha  bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; should be for  them.&#8221; The Prophet;, said, &#8220;The Wala&#8217; will be for the liberator even if they  stipulated a hundred conditions.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Mortgaging </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.685">Volume 3, Book 45, Number 685: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No doubt, the Prophet mortgaged his armor for barley grams.  Once I took barley bread with some dissolved fat on it to the Prophet and I heard him  saying, &#8220;The household of Muhammad did not possess except a Sa (of food grain,  barley, etc.) for both the morning and the evening meals although they were nine  houses.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.686"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 686: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet bought some foodstuff on credit for a limited  period and mortgaged his armor for it. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.687"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 687: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who would kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf as he has harmed Allah and His Apostle ?&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and)  said, &#8220;I will kill him.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka&#8217;b and said, &#8220;I  want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Mortgage your women  to me.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women, and you are  the most handsome among the Arabs?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then mortgage your sons to  me.&#8221; Muhammad said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them  for being mortgaged for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as  promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 688: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;One can ride the mortgaged animal  because of what one spends on it, and one can drink the milk of a milch animal as long as  it is mortgaged. &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.689"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 689: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The mortgaged animal can be  used for riding as long as it is fed and the milk of the milch animal can be drunk  according to what one spend on it. The one who rides the animal or drinks its milk should  provide the expenditures.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle bought some foodstuff from a Jew and  mortgaged his armor to him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 691: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I wrote a letter to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and he wrote to me that the  Prophet had given the verdict that the defendant had to take an oath. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.045.692"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 45, Number 692: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud) said, &#8220;Whoever took a false oath  in order to grab somebody&#8217;s property will meet Allah while Allah will be angry with  him.&#8221; Allah revealed the following verse to confirm that:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who  purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant And their oaths&#8230;a painful  torment.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu  Abdur-Rehman (i.e. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) was telling you.&#8221; We related the story to him. On that  he said, &#8220;He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute  with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to me), &#8220;Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the  defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).&#8217; I said, &#8216;The defendant  would not mind to take a false oath.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Whoever took a  false oath in order to grab someone else&#8217;s property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry  with him.&#8217; Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath then recited the  following Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!&#8217; (3.77) (See  Hadith No. 546) </font></p>
