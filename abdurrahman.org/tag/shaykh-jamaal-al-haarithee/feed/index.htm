<b>Author: </b>Jamaal bin Furayhaan Al-Haarithee<br />
<b>Source: </b><i>Al-Ajwibah Al-Mufeedah</i> [3rd Edition (pg. 14-18)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Name, Lineage and Birth:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is <strong>Saalih bin Fawzaan bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Fawzaan</strong> from the people of Shamaasiyyah from the tribe of Dawaasir. He was born in 1354H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Upbringing and Education:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father passed away while he was young. So he was brought up in his household and learned the noble Qur’aan. He also learned the basics of reading and writing at the hands of the Imaam of the local town’s masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then joined the state school in his town in Ash-Shamaasiyyah when it opened in 1369H. He completed his primary education in the Faisaliyah School in Buraidah in 1371H. After this, he joined the educational institute in Buraidah at the time of its inception in 1373H and graduated from it in 1377H. Then he joined the College of Sharee’ah in Riyadh and graduated from there in 1381H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Advanced Studies:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He achieved his Masters Degree in the subject of Fiqh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He obtained his Doctorates Degree also in Fiqh. He received both of these degrees from the College of Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Positions he was Given and Some of his Duties:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was appointed a primary school teacher in 1372H before he joined the educational institute in Buraidah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was appointed a teacher in the educational institute in Riyadh after graduating from the College of Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then appointed a teacher in the College of Sharee’ah and then in the advanced studies of the College of Usool-ud-Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he taught at the advanced institute of judicial education, and later became a director there in 1396H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went back to teaching there one more time after his scheduled period of administration came to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then appointed to the Council of Senior Scholars in 1407H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, he was appointed a member of the Permanent Committee of Educational Research and Religious Verdicts in 1411H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is also still a member of the Fiqh Assembly of Makkah which falls under the World Muslim League.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a former member of the Supervisory Council for Callers during Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, he serves as an Imaam, khateeb and teacher at the Prince Mut’ib bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Central Mosque in Malaz, Riyadh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also participates in answering questions on the Saudi radio program “<i>Noor ‘alaad-Darb</i>” (Light upon the Path). He also has a scheduled participation on the committee of research, studies, letters and verdicts in educational magazines as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah preserve him, also supervises many of the scholastic essays submitted by students for their Masters and Doctorates degrees. Numerous students of knowledge who attend his frequent educational classes and gatherings have studied under him – myself being one of them – and I am proud and pleased with that – Jamaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Teachers:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh sought knowledge at the hands of numerous well-known scholars and judges. Amongst the most famous of them was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him. He would praise and hold great esteem for our Shaikh, and he would rely on him in important matters. He would send him some books for him to review and comment on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also among his teachers was Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Humaid, may Allaah have mercy on him. He would attend many of his lessons in the Central Mosque of Buraidah during the time that he was a student in the educational institute there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also learned from Shaikh Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His teachers also include Shaikh Hamood bin Sulaymaan At-Talaal who was the Imaam of the masjid in the town that he grew up in. He, i.e. Shaikh Hamood, may Allaah preserve him, was then appointed a judge after that in the town of Dariyyah in the district of Qaseem. Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan had learned the basics of reading and writing from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learned under Shaikh Ibraaheem bin Daifillaah Al-Yoosuf at the time he was a teacher in the Shamaasiyyah School.</p>

SOURCE: His book: Lam ad-Durr al-Manthoor (pg. 47-49)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Chapter 15: The People of Innovations are worse than the People of Sins</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[134]</b> Abu Moosaa said: “That I live next to a Jew and a Christian, and monkeys and pigs, is more beloved to me than that if I were to live next to a follower of desires (i.e. deviant), who will spread disease to my heart.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[135]</b> Yoonus bin ‘Ubaid said to his son: “I forbid you from fornicating, stealing and drinking alcohol. But if you were to meet Allaah having committed these (sins), that would be more beloved (to me) than if you were to meet Him with the views of ‘Amr bin ‘Ubaid or the followers of ‘Amr.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[136]</b> Abul-Jawzaa said: “If the apes and the swine were to live with me in a house, that would be more beloved to me than if a person from Ahlul-Ahwaa (deviants) were to live with me. They have entered into the ayah: <b>‘And when they meet you they say: We believe. But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: Perish in your rage. Allaah knows what is in the hearts.’</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 119]” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[137]</b> Al-‘Awwaam bin Hawshab said about his son ‘Eesaa: “By Allaah, if I saw ‘Eesaa gathering with the people of musical instruments, alcohol and falsehood, that would be more beloved to me than if I were to see him sitting with the people of argumentation – the innovators.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[138]</b> Yahyaa bin ‘Ubaid said: “A man from the Mu’atazilah encountered me (one day), so I got up and said: “Either you pass on or I will pass on, for indeed if I were to walk with a Christian, that would be more loved to me than if I were to walk with you.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[139]</b> Arta’ Ibn al-Mundir said: “If my son were one of the sinful wicked people, that would be more beloved to me than if he were a Follower of Desires (i.e. a deviant).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[140]</b> Sa’eed bin Jubair said: “If my son were to keep the company of a sinning scoundrel upon the Sunnah that would be more beloved to me than if he were to accompany a worshipping innovator.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[141]</b> It was once said to Maalik bin Mughawal: “We saw your son playing with the birds.” So he responded: “How wonderful that it preoccupies him from accompanying an innovator.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[142]</b> Al-Barbahaaree said: “If you see a person whose manner and opinion is despicable, he is wicked, sinful, and oppressive, yet he is a person of the Sunnah, accompany him and sit with him, since his sin will not harm you. And if you see a man who strives hard and long in worship, is abstemious, being continual in worship, except that he is a person of innovation, do not sit with him, do not listen to his words, and do not walk along with him, since I do not feel safe that you will not eventually come to be pleased with his way and go to destruction along with him.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[143]</b> Abu Haatim said: “I heard Ahmad bin Sinaan said: “That a Tanboor player were to live next to me is more beloved to me than if an innovator were to live next to me. This is since I can forbid the Tanboor player and I can break the tanboor (a mandolin-like instrument). But as for the innovator, he corrupts the people, the neighbors and the youth.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[144]</b> Imam ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “If the servant were to meet Allaah having committed every sin except Shirk, that would be better for him than if he were to meet Allaah with some deviant belief.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[145]</b> Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The graves of sinners from People of Sunnah is a garden, while the graves of the pious ascetics from the People of Innovation is a barren pit. The sinners among Ahlus-Sunnah are the Friends of Allaah, while the pious among Ahlul-Bid’ah are the Enemies of Allaah.” [12]</p>

SOURCE: Al-Ajwibat-ul-Mufeedah &#8216;an As&#8217;ilat-il-Manaahij-il-Jadeedah (pg. 92-94) [2nd Edition]<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: Al-Mawdoodee:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in his book <i>Rasaa’il wa Masaa’il</i> (pg. 57, 1351H Edition): “The Messenger of Allaah used to think that the Dajjaal would appear during his time or close to his time. However, 1350 years have passed on this speculation (from the Prophet), many long centuries, and still the Dajjaal has not appeared. So this proves that his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) speculation was not correct!!” In the 1362H edition of the book, he added to this, saying: “However, 1350 years have passed …and still the Dajjaal has not appeared. So this is the reality.” This is a clear rejection of the advent of the Dajjaal, for which there are many authentic ahaadeeth reported informing of his coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said (pg. 55): “It is confirmed that everything that has been reported in his ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal was just the opinion and estimation of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>), and that he had doubts over this issue.” Is this not a clear rejection of the Dajjaal and a denial of the reports of the Messenger about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And he does not speak from his own desire, rather it is revelation that is revealed to him.”</b>[Surah An-Najm: 3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says in his book <i>Arba’atu Mustalahaat-ul-Qur’aan al-Asaasiyah</i> (pg. 156): “Allaah commanded the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) in Surah An-Nasr to ask his Lord’s forgiveness for what occurred from him from deficiencies and shortcomings with regard to fulfilling the obligations – i.e. the obligations of prophethood.” We seek Allaah’s refuge from such a lie!! Is it not sufficient for him that Allaah described His Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) with the characteristic of servitude (<i>‘uboodiyyah</i>), which is the most perfect of human characteristics? He described him with this attribute (i.e. slave of Allaah) in many verses throughout His Book. Where is he with respect to the Prophet’s statement in the hadeeth about the three people that asked about his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) worship – and it is as if he is replying to this issue – in which he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“As for me, then I am the most dutiful to Allaah amongst you”</b>?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Jamaal bin Fareehaan Al-Haarithee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Al-Ajwibat-ul-Mufeedah &#8216;an As&#8217;ilat-il-Manaahij-il-Jadeedah</i> (pg. 33-37) [2nd Edition]<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone might say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Why do you talk about the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’atazliah</a></em>, the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/">Jahmiyyah</a></em>, the <em>Zanaadiqah</em>, the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/ashariyyah/">Ash<em>’</em>arees</a>, the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawaarij</a> </em>and the <em>Murji’ah</em> and always mention them when speaking about the issues of Creed, when these groups have ceased to exist and its adherents have died out?” As the saying goes: “They have been consumed by time.” So there is no reason to mention them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our response is, and with Allaah lies the success: Yes, these sects existed in the past, and their followers and founders have died out ages ago. However, their ideologies still prevail, and their beliefs have not come to an end. Rather, the followers of these ideas and beliefs, who have been influenced by these groups, are still present among us today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their ideologies and beliefs are passed on from generation to generation, and they have people who continue to pass them on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the beliefs of the <em>Mu’tazliah</em>, then it is still in existence today and in fact it is widely spread amongst those who ascribe to Islaam. This is since the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/shia-raafidah/"><em>Shee’ah</em></a>, in all of their various sects and denominations, even the Zaydees among them, adhere to the beliefs of the Mu’tazliah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ash’arees, then it is a sect that exists in groups amongst a majority of the Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the belief of <i>Irjaa,</i> it can be found also in the Hanafees who believe that Eemaan (Faith) is just tasdeeq (affirmation) and <i>qawl</i> (speech). So actions, according to them, do not fall into the fold of Eemaan. Even though this <i>Irjaa</i> is of a lesser nature, it is still from the <i>Irjaa</i> of the well-known people of rhetoric.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the apostates, such as those who believe in <i>wahdat-ul-wujood</i> and other than them, then they exist today as well, since the followers of Ibn ‘Arabee can be found today and they are from the extreme <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/">Sufis</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, when we mention these groups, we are not talking about the actual groups of old, but rather we are talking about the groups that exist among the Muslims today. And this is something that is not hidden from the students of knowledge. So it is only those who are unaware of the realities or those who wish to confuse the people and spread false beliefs that condemn us when we mention these groups. So it is upon such people to ask before they condemn. This is just a short discussion on the matter, but in reality this topic is vast, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will present some examples below that make it clear that the ideologies of these destructive groups are still present today:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Sayyid Qutb said in his book “In the Shade of the Qur’aan” (4/2328): “The Qur’aan is present and in existence just like the earth and the heavens.” This is the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/quran/">belief that the Qur’aan is created</a>, and this is the view of the Jahmiyyah and other deviant groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He also said in the afore-mentioned book (6/4002) while interpreting Allaah’s statement: <b>“Say: He is Allaah, the One”</b> [Surah Al-Ikhlaas: 1]: “This indeed refers to the oneness of existence. So there is no reality except for His reality, nor is there a true existence except for His existence. So everything else that exists, its existence stems from that actual existence.” This is the belief of <i><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/10/18/the-ascendancy-of-allaah-a-refutation-of-wahdatul-wujood-hulool-shaykh-albaanee/">wahdat-ul-wujood</a></i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muhammad Qutb said: “The matter requires us to call the people to Islaam all over again, not because, this time, they reject saying <i><b>‘Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah’ </b></i>with their mouths, as the people during the first stage of strangeness would do, but because the people during this time reject the main requisite of <i><b>Laa Ilaaha Ilaa Allaah</b></i>, which is: Judging by the Legislation of Allaah.” [Quoted from the book “Our Current Situation” (pg. 29)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: This is declaring the masses to be disbelievers, in the absolute sense. If this is not so, then how can he judge that the people reject Allaah’s Rule. And how can he liken them to the Days of Ignorance prior to Islaam, without going into detail or making exceptions for those who do in fact implement Allaah’s Legislation, and who have no constitution except the Book of Allaah? These kinds of general statements are oft repeated by these writers, as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of the huge Salafee Islamic state located in the heart of Arabia. And it is as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of Muslims in various other regions that are from the followers of Hadeeth, supporters of the Sunnah and adherents to the beliefs of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that these people, or some of them, were living in this Islamic state (The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) at the time they made such statements, which contain grave deception for the readers, such that an average person is led to believe that there cannot be found an Islamic state today that professes <i>Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah</i>, implementing its requisites and ruling by Allaah’s Laws. And it leads the reader to believe that there cannot be found any individuals or groups that adhere to Tawheed on the face of this earth. And this is deceiving, misleading and deluding the readers. So let the student of knowledge take note of this phenomenon that is widespread amongst these types of writers, may Allaah guide them to what is correct!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. One of those who ascribes himself to the Da’wah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“From the outward display of sins is when a person boasts about his sins in front of his colleagues. So he begins to speak aloud, saying he did such and such, and he goes into detail about many of his sins. This kind of person will not be forgiven (!!), unless he repents, because the Prophet ruled concerning him that he will not be pardoned: <b>‘Everyone from my ummah will be pardoned except for those who outwardly profess their evil.’</b> And what is worse and viler than this is when some of them say: ‘I have unlawful relations’ or ‘I have girlfriends’ or ‘I go on dates.’ This person is filled with sins. Some of these people even record sins on tapes! There is no honor for these people since they are apostates by doing this!! They record how to beguile a girl and get her to commit lewd acts. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This is apostasy from Islaam!</span> This person (who records this) will be in the Fire of Hell forever unless he repents!!”</b> [From the tape “A Gathering on the Platform]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regard to some of the singers, whose tapes are spread around by the youth – tapes which call to filthiness and which delude the young boys and girls, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“I am certain that the person who does this act, the least that can be said about him, is that he takes sins lightly. And there is no doubt that belittling a sin, especially if it is a major sin and the scholars have unanimously agreed on its prohibition, constitutes disbelief in Allaah. So the likes of these people, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no doubt that their actions are apostasy from Islaam</span>. I say this with a tranquil and calm heart.”</span> <b>[The tape: “The Youth – Questions and Problems]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I say:</strong> Declaring sinners to be disbelievers and interpreting the spread and distribution of sins amongst the people as being a belittlement of sins that leads to disbelief, this shows hastiness in labeling people disbelievers due to major sins and a lack of showing restraint</span>. And this is from the methodology of the Khawaarij, as they declare people to be disbelievers due to major sins. As for the example he gave of a person manifesting his sins and evil relationships with sinners, then this kind of talk shows that these things are probable but do not consist of clear proof. Perhaps the thing that causes the person to do this is ignorance. This is why we must remind them and not declare them disbelievers. And this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Furthermore, belittling something and taking it lightly does not constitute a mockery of it. In fact, everyone that commits a sin, whether major or minor, doesn’t do so unless he first considers it trivial and belittles it. So someone who takes something lightly doesn’t necessarily ridicule it. And who is the one that is free from sins?! And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another person said, whilst asking a question and then responding to it at the same time: <span style="color:#999999;">“Do you think that the evils that are present in our communities today are just sinful matters? Many people assume today that interest is just a sin or a major sin, and that drugs and alcohol are sins, and that bribery is just a sin or one of the major sins… No doubt O brothers!! I have looked into this matter and it has become clear to me now that: Many people in our societies have made interest lawful, and refuge is sought in Allaah. Did you know that now the interest-based banks in our country has reached two million customers? I swear this to you by Allaah! Does each individual from these millions know that interest is Haraam, but yet still deals with it even though it is a sin?! By Allaah!! So then, from the danger that is present today, due to the vast amount of widespread sins is that many people have made these major sins permissible and lawful, and we seek Allaah’s refuge!</span> <b>[From the tape Tawheed First (!!)]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reply with the same answer I gave in the previous example. However, this example is more dangerous for the one who made this statement, in my understanding, since in his grave exaggeration, he claims that what occurs in this society from interest, alcohol and bribery, all of these are not just disobedience or major sins. And he swears by Allaah to this! Being determined that the one who commits sins is deeming it to be permissible, without hearing from anyone of them that they clearly assert interest to be lawful, or dealing with bribes to be lawful or using drugs and alcohol to be lawful – to positively deem these people to be disbelievers without hearing these statements come from them or having a reliable proof that bears witness that they in fact deem these acts to be permissible, and to instead only have assumptions, is a clear proof of the weak restraint and lack of consideration this individual has. This is the methodology of the Khawaarij and the Mu’tazliah. So my advice to him and those like him is to recant from making such general assertions that are more dangerous for them than for others. Turning back to the truth is better than persisting in falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. A third person, who has a doctorate in ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, said whilst holding in his hand a flyer from a hotel in one of the Gulf states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“In this hotel, it clearly states, that they serve alcoholic drinks, in addition to the other things it has…So this is a clear call to alcohol and to naked and intermingled dancing whilst drinking alcohol. We seek Allaah’s refuge from this disbelief.”</span> <b>[From Cassette No. 272/2 of The Explanation of al-‘Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah] </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said in a book of his:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Disbelief and apostasy has appeared in our newspapers, evil has spread in our circles and we are called to fornication on our radios and television sets. And we have made interest lawful.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was prepared and printed with various different titles. In Pakistan, it went by the title: “Removing the Grief from the Scholars of the Ummah.” In America, it goes by the title: “Kissinger’s Promise.” And in Egypt, the book was titled: “Facts surrounding the Gulf Crisis.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, you have seen how this individual has taken it upon himself to make the statement that we have made interest permissible. But we, all praise be to Allaah, do not deem interest as being permissible, nor does our society. Nor do we consider simply distributing alcoholic drinks to some of the neighboring regions as being open disbelief that expels one from the fold of Islaam. Rather, that which we worship Allaah with, is that those things mentioned by these individuals that ascribe themselves to the Da’wah – all of these things are sins, apart from disbelief. In fact all of these acts are a lesser form of disbelief (i.e. minor disbelief), meaning that they are acts of disobedience and major sins that negate the completeness of Eemaan of the person who commits them, but not the foundation of Eemaan, as the Prophet said: <b>“A fornicator does not fornicate whilst being a believer at the time he fornicates. And a thief does not steal whilst being a believer at the time he is stealing…” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt the Eemaan (Faith) that is being negated here is the completeness of Eemaan (i.e. so the sinner does not have complete Eemaan, meaning his Eemaan is deficient). And there are many more examples of this in our Religion. We ask Allaah to grant us understanding of our Religion and to guide these people and their likes to the truth. My dear brother, O you who strives for this Salafee methodology! After seeing these examples of the ideologies present in some of the callers today, not to mention the youth that are deceived by them, and who sit in front of them, taking their ideas and beliefs, which destroy the Creed of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeing all this, will you still say: “Why do you talk about these groups that have come to an end”, when their deviant and corrupt beliefs and methods still exist and their misguidance is still present?? So reflect, may Allaah guide you, on the importance of Tawheed and of implementing it, and on warning about all of the deviant groups in every time and place, and on returning back to the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih (righteous predecessors), in light of the Book and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salamu &#8216;ala Rasool Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is from Shaikh Jamaal Al-Haarithee from his comments on Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan&#8217;s <strong>Beneficial Answers to Questions on Innovated Methodologies</strong> (hafidhahumullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the book<strong> as-Sunnah</strong> of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (2/351), <strong>al-Mustadrak</strong> of Al-Haakim (3/290) and the <strong>Musnad</strong> of Imaam Ahmad (3/404) from the narration of &#8216;Iyyaad bin Ghanam that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;Whoever has some advice for the leader should not speak it out in public. Rather, he should take his hand and sit with him in privacy. So if he [the ruler] accepts it, then he accepts it, and if he doesn&#8217;t, then he [the advisor] has performed what is required of him and what is for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording of this hadeeth is from Al-Haakim, and it is a sound hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#993300;">Look at the example of the Imaam of Ahlus Sunnah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah). He was beaten with a whip, dragged on the floor, and imprisoned due to the [the deviants&#8217; claim] of the Qur`an being created. But in spite of this, he would refer to him [the ruler] as the &#8220;Commander of the Believers&#8221; and tell the people:</span> <span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Do not rebel (against the leader); be patient.&#8221;</span> <span style="color:#993300;">Don&#8217;t we have a good example in our righteous predecessors? Or is it that we are more knowledgeable and braver than them?!</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in his book <strong>Jaami&#8217;ul-&#8216;Uloom wal Hikam</strong> (pg. 113):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Sincere Advice to the Muslim leaders means cooperating with them upon the truth, obeying them, reminding them, cautioning them with gentleness and ease, preventing an uprise against them, and supplicating for them to be guided.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> said in his book Raf&#8217;-ul-Asaateen fee Hukm-il-Ittisaal bis-Salaateen (pg. 81-82):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;It is well established in the Mighty Book (Qur`an) that we are commanded to obey the ruler. Allaah put obeying the rulers after obeying Him and obeying the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam). There are many ahaadeeth in the purified Sunnah, i.e. the main collections, and other books that state that it is obligatory to obey them [the rulers] and to be patient with their oppression. One of the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) commanded us to obey them [the rulers] consists of the words: &#8216;&#8230;even if he beats your back and takes your money.&#8217; It is also authentically reported on him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) that he said: </span> &#8216;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Give them what they are entitled to (of rights), and ask Allaah for what you are entitled to (of rights).</span>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
