										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BECOMING accustomed talking to one another in a language other than Arabic ‎ so much so that it becomes a habit in the land, with one‎s family, with one‎s friends, in the marketplace, when addressing government representatives or authority figures or when speaking to the people of knowledge ‎ is undoubtedly Makrooh (disliked). <strong>Arabic is a symbol of Islam and the language of the Qur‎&#8217;an</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When early Muslims went to live in Syria and Egypt, where people spoke Byzantine Greek, and in Iraq and Khurasaan, where people spoke Persian, and North Africa (Al-Maghrib) where people spoke Berber, they taught the people of those countries to speak Arabic. Arabic then became the prevalent language in those lands. All people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, spoke Arabic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the case in Khurasaan in the past. Later, they became lax with regard to language and got used to speaking Persian until it became prevalent and Arabic was forgotten by most of them. This is without doubt disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is best to be accustomed in speaking Arabic. Young people will learn it in their homes and schools, and the symbol of Islam and its people will prevail. This will make it easier to understand the Qur‎an and Sunnah, and the words of the Salaf (pious predecessors &#8211; Sahabah, Tabi‎een etc).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Language has a clear and strong effect on one‎s thinking, behavior and religious commitment. It also helps one to resemble with the early generations of this Ummah, the Companions and the Tabi‎een. Being like them improves one‎s thinking, religious commitment and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Arabic language itself is part of Islam, and knowing Arabic is an obligatory duty. If it is a duty to understand the Qur‎an and Sunnah ‎ and they cannot be understood without knowing Arabic ‎ then the means needed to fulfill the duty also becomes obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to Abu Moosa Al-Ash‎aree (May Allah be pleased with him), ‎Learn the Sunnah and learn Arabic. Learn the Qur‎an in Arabic for it is Arabic.‎</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) also said, ‎Learn Arabic for it is part of your religion, and learn how the estate of the deceased should be divided (Faraa‎id) for these are part of your religion.‎</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This command of Umar, to learn Arabic and the Shariah combines the things that are needed, as religion involves understanding words and actions. Understanding Arabic is the way to understand the words of Islam, and understanding the Sunnah is the way to understand the actions of Islam‎‎.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Iqtidaa‎us-Siraatil-Mustaqeem</strong> (2/207). <strong>Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d. 728H) is one of the great and exceptional scholars known in Islamic history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee is one of the professors in the University of al-Madeenah, he is a student of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh began by giving his salutation after sending peace and blessings upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) and after praising Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: O Muslims indeed Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created us and He has not left us to our own desires. Indeed He has prohibited us and He has given us command and He has made it clear to us the path of khair and the path of good and He has encouraged us to follow that. And He has made clear to us the path of evil and has prohibited us from following that. And indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is more knowledgeable concerning that which is good and that which has the best for His servant in this life and the Hereafter. And He is the Most Knowledgeable concerning that which will give them bliss and that which will give them good fortune in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed from the things that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has made it important and placed importance upon<br />
protecting it and upon making sure that the Muslims are mindful with regards to it and that He has prohibited us and made us something that we should be distant from corrupting and that is the honour of the Muslim and that is going to be the title of the talk. And indeed it has been established in a hadith in Saheeh al-Bukhari that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said : &#8216;indeed your blood, and your wealth and your honour, is haraam upon you (it is prohibited upon you) just as this day is haram or considered sacrilegious and just as this month is considered sacrilegious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the honour is something that should be protected by the Muslims in two ways :</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>As for the first way, that which is apparent from the honour of the Muslims : and that is by clothing it using the<br />
garments that the Shariah has laid down and prescribed and what the Messenger has prescribed (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</li>
<li>And as for the second type is that which is hidden from the honour : and that is to protect it from zina and to protect it from homosexuality and those types of affairs.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said : &#8216;O you who believe, indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has sent down upon you a garment that will cover your modesty and He has given you a leash which is something other than from the standard covering. And indeed from the greatest of things that will make the honour of the Muslim corrupt whether they are male or whether they are female and indeed it is that which is referred to or known as &#8216;zina.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;.. and do not come close to zina. Indeed it is something that is lewd and it is an evil way.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed in this ayah Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has made Haraam anything that leads to zina and that is never mind the actual committing of the act. Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216; and do not come close to fawahish, do not come close to lewdness, that which is apparent from it and that which is hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the issue of fornication (may Allaah protect us all from it). Indeed along with it being prohibited it is something that likewise corrupts the society, corrupts the community. And indeed it is from the reasons for the spreading of corruption in and amongst the community.&#8217; Insha-Allaah I am going to mentions some of the reasons and some of the things that corrupts the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the first of the evils that come from zina is that it is one of the causes for the spread of many evils and many diseases connected to fornication, just like the sickness of AIDS and other in that from the sicknesses that destroy the lands and destroy the servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise it is from the reasons that causes commotion in and amongst the family &#8212; as far as it relates to the husband or as far as it relates to the wife and to the children and if the family indeed is split, that will lead to the splitting of the community and indeed they will fall into that which are of the lowly actions and will fall into corruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina is that it is from the reason for talaaq (or divorce) being plentiful in the societies. Because you find after the marriage, after a small space of time you will find the people divorcing each other and sometimes this happens after a space of few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that it lowers the marriage rates in the society. So as for the person who commits fornication and is constant and regular in doing that, then he does not look to marriage except as another way of having a sexual relationship. Not that it is a beautiful way of uniting two bodies, neither it is a life that is built of love and emotions and raising a family and having children and indeed from bringing and having children, it is by way of those children our that lives become happy lives. And likewise it makes life easy with the presence of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise we see from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that we find the level of children and the level of having kids fall in that particular society. Because when zina is one of the reasons for the spread of deadly diseases like AIDS and other than AIDS, we find as a result of that many people die in the society. And as a result of that we find people having children as a result of that die. And as a result of that also the strength of the community is lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the evil effects of zina, is that it leads to much crime in that society. And from that the crimes that generate and likewise a person will enter into stealing and rape in order to satisfy his sexual desires. And likewise as a result of that we find people even killing each other and killing themselves as a result of this spread of this zina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina, is that we find that we have many children, many offspring that are the children that have come as a result of that fornication. And this likewise is from the sins meaning these children have come about as a product of fornication. This is also from the sins that increases crimes, and increases evil doings in and among society. Because the child from a young age is in need of receiving the love and attention from both his parents. So when the child loses out on that care and loses out on that attention, and when he loses that love, then what happens is that he has a reactory feeling as he grows that he was not nurtured upon love and upon affection. So that breeds from him and lead him to haste and dislike to society and the surrounding that he lives in. So, when he reaches the age of maturity, we find that these individuals enough of time end up themselves being individuals that commit evil acts and committing different crimes in order to avenge that society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And brothers and sisters from the things that we can utilize to protect this evil, to protect ourselves from this evil is by following the message, and the measures and the means that al-Islam has laid down for us. The means have been laid down for protecting our &#8216;ird &#8212; lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the most important means for protecting the limits is the establishment of the belief of Allaah in the hearts of the servant. So if the slave then knows and believes that Allaah is the Creator of the creation, and He is the One that is worshipped and there is none worthy of worship other than Him, then he would carry out his commands and he would stay away from his prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he will believe in his heart that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala knows the hidden things and knows those things which are apparent. And likewise he will know that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala sees everything that takes place in this creation. And so this Imaan of his will carry him to be odd and over keeping in mind the presence of Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. And it will lead him likewise, to be distant from disobeying Allaah and it will make him to carry out Allah&#8217;s commands and the things that please Allaah. So not once will Allaah see him in a place where Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala dislikes to see him in and likewise he will not be absent from places that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala loves for him to be in. And that is a condition with the mu&#8217;min and the believer who is sincere with his Imaan, the one who is certain concerning his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen O brother and listen O sister, to the story of that great Sahabah ; that Sahabi who before Islaam used to commit sins as of fornication and he used to visit prostitutes ; look at his condition after his Islaam. Did he continue upon that which he was upon, in his days of Jaahiliyah before Islaam? .. (not clear) &#8230;. And likewise he took upon himself chastity and distanced himself form all evil and all lowly acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This appears in the Sunnan of Tirmidhi that a person from amongst the Sahaba (radiallahu anhu) who was referred to as al-Martad. He used to carry the prisoners of war from Makkah until he reached Medina and there was a woman from amongst the Mushrikeen who was a prostitute or she was a fornicator and her name was &#8216;Anaaq and she was his girlfriend before Islaam. And he had promised a man from amongst the prisoners of war from the people of Makkah that he was carrying. He said to them radiallaahu &#8216;I continued until I came to a wall from the walls of Makkah in the shade of a wall on the full moon night man, so &#8216;Anaaq (this woman) came to him and she had noticed that this man being detained near the wall. So when she came to me she realized that it was me. So I said, &#8216;my name is Martad&#8217; and she said, &#8216;welcome.&#8217; She then said, &#8216;come and sleep with me tonight.&#8217; So she was calling him to the lewdness. So I said, &#8216;O Anaaq, indeed Allaah has made zina Haraam. Allaahu Akbar!&#8217;. So the Shaykh is saying look then brother Muslim may Allaah guide you and myself to success. Look at the Imaan that Martad had concerning Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and how it prevented him from committing zina even though it was easy for him to commit that act. So may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him. Look how his complete turn around came for him after he was a committer of major sins and major evil deeds prior to his Islaam? Look how Islaam turned the whole direction of his life. And he became the best of the people as regards to him being chaste, as regards to him having adab, and with regards to him having taqwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore from the first of the things that we can utilize to protect ourselves from this sick disease, it is to have Imaan in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second affair is that we make sincere tawbah to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala for all of our sins. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;and those who when they commit a sin or when they run themselves, they remember Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and make isthighfar for their sins. And who will forgive sins other than Allaah as long as they do not persist upon that which they did while they know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the things that will protect ourselves and from the methods and means that have been laid down in the Shariah is that indeed Islaam is the deen of the fitrah and its way is the just way, balanced way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has affirmed for mankind that which he has established or that which he has within him a way of desire for sexual actions. But Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has not made it absolute for him to utilize or enjoy his desire in any way that he pleases. And at the same time He has not prohibited him from enjoying sexual pleasures absolutely but rather it has reigns and orders for him that desire of his. And that sis with the connection of the link of marriage. Because when Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala created mankind, He created for him his wife so that he may receive tranquility from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;and indeed from His signs is that He has created for you wives so that you may<br />
receive tranquility and reside with them. And He has made between you love and He has made between you Mercy.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Allaah has made and prescribed marriage by way or which a person can increase in love and emotional feelings. And a way for him to protect himself from falling into evil deeds and lewd deeds. And for that reason Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encouraged that we should marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In both Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O gathering of youth, whosoever from amongst you is able then let him marry. Because it is better for the lowering of the gaze. And it is better as a protection of the private parts. And whosoever is not able to do so then let him fast, because then indeed it is a protection for him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that protect ones private parts (and things connected to that), that the method of protecting &#8212; &#8211; that men not mix with the women. Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah mentions in his book, &#8216;and there is no doubt that to let the women mix with the men is the origin of every evil. And it is from the greatest reasons for Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala revealing or sending upon the people punishments and likewise it is from the reason that the general and the specific affairs become corrupt. And the men mixing with the women is a reason for zina, fawahisha, lewdness and evil act connected to sexual related acts being committed between men and women. And it is from the reasons for diseases and plagues when the prostitutes began to mix with the army of Musa, and evil deeds and lewdness began to spread among them. Indeed Allaah sent upon them at that point plague and diseases and 70,000 people died as a result of that. And we ask Allaah that He protects us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the protective reasons that has been laid down by the Shariah for the male Muslim and the female Muslim, that the women wear the hijaab and screen themselves from strange men. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;..and stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of the days of Jaahiliyah&#8217; and Allaah azzawajal says addressing his message to his Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : &#8216;O Messenger, say to your wives, daughters and to the women from amongst the Muslimeen, that they should throw the jilbaabs over themselves, that is better for them not to be known or not to be recognized and they will not be harmed. And indeed Allaah is al- Ghaffoor ar-Raheem.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons is that a woman stays in her home and that she doesn&#8217;t leave her home except for a<br />
pressing need. Allaah says in the previous ayah, &#8216;.. stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of jaahiliyah. And you know O servants of Allaah, (O female slave of Allaah) that the Shaitaan who is the major enemy for us utilizes the issue of the women leaving out of their homes, using her as a means of corrupting the men and utilizing the men for corrupting her. And indeed the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) has said, &#8216;indeed the whole of the woman is an awrah. So if she leaves her home, then indeed the shaitaan beautifies her and makes her fall into some type of fitnah and attempts her to fall into some lowly deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from that a person distances himself from music as it is established with the people who have intellect that the beautiful voice has a direct effect upon the heart especially the heart of the woman. Music has an effect more on the woman than it has on the men. And if that music is accompanied with singing and with the playing of musical instruments, the effect that it has on the hearts in calling that person to lewdness is indeed greater. And for that reason Fudayl Ibn Iyyad rahimahullah mentioned that music is the ruqya of zina &#8211; meaning it is the thing that will lead towards it and will draw towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says in the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8216;and indeed from the people of those who buy lahwal hadeed (meaning music here) in order to misguide from the path of Allaah and Ibn Masood radiallaahu anhu swore three times by Allaah regarding the tafseer concerning this ayah and the explanation of the lahwal hadeed that it is ghina, it is music and likewise from the reasons that protect ourselves from this lewdness will be mentioned in a summarized form so that we don&#8217;t spend too long here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them the Shaykh mentions is that a person both men and women lowers their gazes. Because the sight that it takes to look is from the arrows <strong>from the arrows of Iblees</strong>. And for that reason the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained, &#8216;that the first look that you take for a woman is for you i.e it is overlooked and the second one is against you. And that is because the first look that a person took was not intentional i.e he did not intentionally take that look of that woman. So Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala had mercy upon us and forgave us for that. And as for the second look then the mu&#8217;min the male and the female believer are both taken to account for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the woman should not perfume herself when she leaves from her house. Indeed Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) prohibited that. And likewise from the reasons that will protect the society from this is that a woman does not show her beautification or that which she wears underneath her jilbaab except to those individuals who are from her mahrim (Mahram) who are lawful from her relatives.Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said that she should not show anything of her beautification except that which is<br />
apparent from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that will protect us bi-iznillaah that a woman does not enter in her speech i.e she does not go into too much depth with her speech and that she does not soften her speech to strange men. Whether that is upon the telephone or upon other than the telephone. And this is indeed from the greatest of reasons that leads to that evil. Because indeed if she is soft in her speech, then that one who has something from sickness from his heart , will enter into his heart to have something with her by way of evil actions or by way of adultery or fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that we can protect, is that a person distances himself from intoxicants. Because indeed the khamr and the intoxicant are the mother of all evils. And by way a person would fall into zina and likewise it is a stealing and likewise it is a killing these souls that have been prohibited for us to kill. Rather a person would fall into every type of lowly act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that will protect us is that we keep clear from touching in any way a strange woman except in extreme necessity. O Servants of Allaah, indeed when the believer believes in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala there is no doubt that he is going to be tested and that he is going to be under trial. And for that reason Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala when he created the Jannah, He surrounded it with the distasteful things. It was surrounded by things that are distasteful like Jihaad because a person may possibly die and it is something that is difficult for a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he wakes up at night at the time that it is very cold, and that you make wudhu and you pray. As for the tareeq or path to the Hellfire may Allaah protect us and you from it, is something that is easy iyaazu billaah. By doing those things that have connections with our desires like zina and drinking khamr and consuming wealth unlawfully and other than that from the evil act. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;Alif Laam Meem, do the people believe that they are going to be left alone saying that we believe and that they will not be put under trial. Indeed we put to trial those who came before them and Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala will know those who were truthful in their Imaan and Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will know by way of those that who are liars &amp;ndash; the kaazibeen.nd likewise Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;do you believe that you are going to enter Jannah and it did not come to you that which came to those who came before you? They were struck with hardships and calamities and they were shook until the Messenger and those who believe along with him said, &#8216;when is the aid of Allaah going to come? Indeed the aid of Allaah is near.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you O my brother Muslim, and you O my sister Muslimah indeed you have chosen al-Islaam as your religion and this is the way of the anbiya alaihissalaatu wassalam and it is upon you that you remain firm upon the religion of Allaah and that you are not shaken in your Imaan and that you are not deceived by the duny and by its beautification and by Allaah you don&#8217;t know when you are going to die. And you don&#8217;t know when that thing that thing that stops all of one&#8217;s desires and stops all of one&#8217;s pain is going to end and going to come, so die while you are upon Islaam and while you are upon Imaan and while being in a state of being distant from the lewd deed and the evil deeds. &#8216;O Allaah make us to see the Haqq and bless us to follow it. O Allaah make us see the baathil and the falsehood and bless us to stay away from it. And do not make it something that is not clear to us, so that we go astray. O Allaah make the best of our deeds of the dunya the last of our deeds, and the best of our action the last of our actions and the last of our days the day that we meet you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>May Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio </em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8216;The rulings of al-Khula&#8217; in Islaam&#8217; pg. 36-38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar and daa&#8217;ee, Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali[1] said, &#8220;&#8230;.And in the Sunan of Ibn Majah the prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) stated, &#8220;From the things that makes a man happy is a righteous wife whom whenever he looks at her she pleases him, whenever he commands her she obeys him, and whenever he is absent she is faithful with herself and his wealth.&#8221; Hadeeth hasan (hadeeth no. 1857).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on you &#8211; at this hadeeth which illustrates therein a very high wisdom from the lips of the one who has been given concise, eloquent speech that contains much profound meaning. For indeed herein he summed up the conditions for a happy martial life:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first one is that the woman is attractive in the eyes of the husband<br />
2. She willingly fulfills his requests and does what he wants; and this is the sign of true love<br />
3. He trusts her and she trusts him. Hence if he is absent for a long or short period, he will be rest assured that she will safeguard her honor and integrity, and ensure that his wealth is not wasted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without these conditions neither of the spouses can ever be happy. And the Europeans have claimed to have attained the pinnacle of marital bliss because they allow the fiancé to interact with his fiancée before the marriage in a manner that is very disturbing. It is quite possible for this relationship to continue like this for years whereby they are &#8216;still getting to know each other,&#8217; to get to learn the other person&#8217;s behavioral traits and personality so that they can be more compatible with each other in order to make the relationship more lasting. They know however that this is a big farce. Because neither of the spouses trust the other &#8211; as far as being faithful to each other, or being honest with their money. Because the husband cannot tell his wife to do anything because obedience is not an obligation for them. Hence they are like two business or trade partners. And this illustrates the fallacy of the stipulation which is that they must &#8216;be in love&#8217; first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the argument that supports unrestricted interaction before the marriage contract, (this is also a fallacy) because they do not really get to know the true character of the other companion because each of them &#8216;puts on an act&#8217; for the other, and feign signs of adulation for fear that the engagement will be called off. And almost none of them reveals his/her true character until they get married. And there are many incidents like this that proves this to be true. For indeed this happened in Germany in the city of Bonn wherein a man who was engaged to his fiancée for 20 years, and they lived together as a man would live with his wife. However when they married the marriage did not last but one year; all of it being disagreements, bickering, and argumentation, eventually ending in divorce.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8216;The rulings of al-Khula&#8217; in Islaam&#8217; pg. 36-38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foot Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] He is a descendant of the Prophet&#8217;s grandson Husain (radiallaahu anhu). He was born in Morocco in 1311 (1893) and he died 1408 (1997). He is well known for his translation of the meanings of the interpretation of the Noble Qur&#8217;an and Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree said about him, &#8220;In reality I have met anyone who has more knowledge in so many various subjects other than Dr. al-Hilali. Forty five years have passed and I have never seen anyone like him. He was fluent in languages such as Hebrew, German, English, Spanish, in addition to being a scholar in Arabic. He is my shaykh for I benefit from him greatly. He was salafi in his aqeedah, and if you read his book about at-Tawheed you would know that no one knows at-Tawheed in the Qur&#8217;an like him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.1]: How can we make <i>hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah nowadays?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.1]: </b>The praise is for Allaah.  <i>Hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah means moving from the land of <i>Shirk </i>to the land of Islaam, as the Muslims moved from Makkah before its people became Muslim to al-Madeenah, because it had become the city of Islaam after its people had pledged their allegiance (<i>bay’ah</i>) to the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and asked him to make <i>hijrah</i> to them. So <i>Hijrah</i> means migrating to join other Muslims. <i>Hijrah</i> may also take the form of moving from one land of <i>Shirk</i> to another land of <i>Shirk</i> where evil is less prevalent and there is less danger to the Muslims, as when some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah, at the command of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), to Abyssinia (Ethiopia).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the Source of Strength.  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions, and grant them peace. [1]<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.2]: What are the necessary qualities that must be present in a country for it to be regarded as <i>daarul-harb</i> (land of war) or <i>daarul-kufr</i> (land of disbelief)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.2]: </b>The Praise is for Allaah Every land or region in which the rulers and those in authority uphold the limits set by Allaah and they rule their people in accordance with Islaamic <i>Sharee’ah</i>, and the people are able to carry out what Islaam has enjoined upon them, is considered to be <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> (the land of Islaam).  The Muslims in such lands have to obey their rulers with regard to that which is right (<i>ma’roof</i>) and be sincere towards them, helping them to take care of the affairs of state and giving them moral and practical support. They should live there, and not go to live anywhere else except to another place which is under Islaamic rule where they may be better off. This is like the case of al-Madeenah after the <i>Hijrah</i> of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), when the Islaamic state was established there, and like Makkah after the Conquest, when the Muslims took power there and it became <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> after it had been <i>daarul-harb</i> and it had been obligatory for the Muslims there who were able to leave, to migrate from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every country or region in which the rulers and those in authority do not uphold the limits set by Allaah and do not govern those who are under their care by the rules of Islaam, and in which the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of Islaam, is <i>daarul-kufr</i> (the land of kufr). This is like Makkatul-Mukarramah before the Conquest, when it was <i>daarul-kufr</i>.  The same applies to any land in which the people belong to the religion of Islaam, but those who are in authority govern by laws other than those revealed by Allaah, and the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of their Religion.  They have to migrate from that place, fleeing so that their religious commitment will not be compromised, to a land which is ruled by Islaam and where they will be able to do that which is required of them by <i>Sharee’ah</i>. Whoever is unable to migrate men, women or children will be excused, but Muslims in other lands are obliged to save them and bring them from the <i>kaafir</i> lands to the Muslim land. Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Verily, as for those whom the angels take </b>(in death)<b> while they are wronging themselves </b>(as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them)<b>, they </b>(angels)<b> say </b>(to them)<b>: In what </b>(condition)<b> were you? They reply: We were weak and oppressed on the earth. They </b>(angels)<b> say: Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein? Such men will find their abode in Hell what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allaah is likely to forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But whoever is able to establish the rituals of Islam within his family and establish evidence against the rulers and people in authority, and bring about reform, making them change their ways, then it is prescribed for him to stay among them, because there is the hope that by staying there he may be able to convey the message and reform them so long as he is safe from temptation and <i>fitnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The one who intends to do a sacrifice should not cut his hair and nails</strong><br />
<strong> from the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah UNTIL the sacrifice is done. </strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Al-Albaanee, may Allah shower His Mercy upon him, states in our of his works:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘When the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah appears and one of you wants to do the sacrifice, then he should abstain from (cutting) his hair and his nails<a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank">.</a>’</em> </span></p>
<p>And in a narration:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘Then he should not take anything from his hair or from his nails until he sacrifices.’</em></span></p>
<p> – Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim No<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span>1251 and other than it.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albaani</strong>, may Allah shower his Mercy upon Him, comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I say: And the apparent meaning of the hadeeth is the obligation to leave removing the hair and the nails for the one who has resolved to do the sacrifice until he sacrifices &#8230; and this is what Imaam Ahmad and other than him have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, let those who are afflicted with the shaving of the beard pay attention to this, for indeed shaving it (the beard) for ‘Eed has in it three acts of disobedience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First</strong>: The shaving in of itself, for indeed it is to become feminine and to resemble the disbelievers and to change the creation of Allah as I have explained it in my book Adaab-uz-Zifaaf Fis-Sunnatil-Mutahharah (6th Edition, page 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: Beautifying (oneself) for the ‘Eed through the disobedience of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third</strong>: What this hadeeth has benefitted with from the forbidding of taking (from) the hair for the one who wants to sacrifice. And in reality, very few are those who are saved from these violations (of the religion), even some of the people of knowledge! We ask Allah for safety.”</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (Rahimahullah) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that in Egypt, there was a man who would maintain the mosques, making the call to prayer, etc. He was, by all outward means, an obedient person and devout worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as he usually would, he ascended the minaret to make the call to prayer. At the base of the minaret, there was a Christian woman standing. He saw her, and was seduced by her looks. So, he descended the minaret, went to her, and entered her home. She said to him: “Who are you, and what do you want?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: “I want you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “You have enslaved my eyes, and you have captured my heart.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “I will never answer your desire in a doubtful or suspicious manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Ok, so, I will marry you, then.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “You are a Muslim, and I am a Christian. My father will never allow me to marry you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So, I will become a Christian.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “If you wish to do so, go ahead.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the man became a Christian in order to marry this woman, and lived with the woman’s family in her house. Later on that day, however, he was on the roof of the house. He fell from the roof and died without even having enjoyed his new bride. So, he lost the woman, and he lost his religion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why the people who seek knowledge today don&#8217;t find the success with their knowledge and great benefit with their knowledge ?<br />
The Student of Knowledge Today in Comparison to Those of Yesterday<br />
Lecture by <span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Muhammed Ibn Haadee al-Madhkhaalee</span> [hafidahullaahu ta&#8217;aala]<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator&#8217;s Introduction:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala were giving a very praiseworthy lecture by Shaykh Muhammed Ibn Haadee al-Madhkhaalee [hafidahullaahu ta&#8217;aala] ad-Doctor from Jazaan. He did a beautiful lecture [about 2 weeks ago] entitled: Seeking Knowledge In Our Time &amp; Seeking Knowledge In The Time That Was Before Us. After listening to this lecture; me, myself as the translator, I wanted to say that this has really changed my life, just since I heard this lecture. It had a tremendous effect in my life. So much so, that I just had to share it with the people, so that hopefully it will have an effect on our life or on your life, as it had an effect on my life. Or perhaps even have a greater effect on the lives of those who are listening, than it even had upon me and is continuously having upon me to this very moment right now; walhamdulillaah. The Shaykh &#8211; as a synopsis or the introduction &#8211; to what he talked about in his lecture, so you know what to look for, which is the reason why we entitled it online, the title we gave. Which is, the Shaykh he really talks about <strong>why the people who seek knowledge today don&#8217;t find the success with their knowledge and great benefit with their knowledge </strong>in their lives, and upon themselves, and everyone around them. As we seen, when knowledge was sought by those Imams, those `kibaar al-Ulamaa who just recently died &amp; those that still remain, and the strong students of knowledge; how we see knowledge effect them. So in this lecture the Shaykh, he&#8217;s going to explain why we don&#8217;t find success.<strong> And he breaks it down to 4 main reasons. </strong>In which he&#8217;s going to give them first and then he&#8217;s going to explain each 4 of those reasons. And his lecture in Arabic was a total 1 hour &amp; 10 minutes. With the questions and answers, it added another 33 minutes, but were not going to include, with this, the questions and answers. Were just going to include the lecture. And in shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala were going to translate this and hopefully with the success of Allaah subhannah wa ta&#8217;aala. And that Allaah, with the success lies &amp; to Him I seek assistance and to Him I return to in repentance. So in shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala, this is basically what the Shaykh talked about&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Won&#8217;t you go and take your share?&#8221; &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; they asked.

When they came back, he said, &#8220;What’s the matter?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Aboo Hurayrah! We went to the Masjid, but we didn&#8217;t see anything being distributed.&#8221; Aboo Hurayrah asked them, &#8220;And you didn&#8217;t see anyone in the Masjid?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Indeed we did; we saw people praying, others reciting Qur`an and others studying the regulations of halal and haram.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="color:#1f497d;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saaleh Al Uthaymeen</strong> may Allah have mercy upon him was asked:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;what is the ruling on the one who eats while in doubt if the sun has risen for fajr or not then after that it becomes clear to him that the sun did actually rise, and and also the one who eats thinking the sun has set then after that it becomes clear to him that the sun did not actually set?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The noble Shaykh replied by saying:</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;if one is in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>doubt and thinks</strong></span> &#8211; has the sun risen or not &#8211; then he eats and then after that it becomes clear to him that the sun already rose then it is not upon him to make up his fast; even if he is completly unsure whether it has risen or not. This is because Allah the most high says &#8220;<strong><em> and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of the night)&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#1f497d;"><span style="font-size:small;">And eating in this time is permitted and there is not no sin on the one who eats in this time nor does he have to make up his fast.</span></span><span style="color:#1f497d;"><span style="font-size:small;">As for if one eats <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>thinking </strong></span>the sun has set and then it becomes clear to him after that the the sun did not actually set then it is not upon him to make up his fast upon the most correct opinion, because of the hadeeth of <strong><em>Asmaa bint abu Bakr: the companions opened their fast in the time of the prophet on a cloudy day and they were not orderd to make up their fast.</em></strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who eats <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">in doubt</span> </strong>whether the sun has set and then after that it becomes clear to him that the sun did not set then it is obligatory that he makes up his fast, beause he eate in this state, meaning in a state of <strong>doubt </strong>and it is haraam for one to eat whilst being in this state of doubt. Rather it is not permissable for him to open his fast except if he is certain that the sun has set or at least he is leaning more towards that. In this particular state, meaning if he opens his fast and he is in doubt then it becomes clear to him that the sun did not set it is waajib for him to repeat his fast because his was not permitted to open his fast in that state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha ibn ‘Ubaydallah (radhiallahu `anhu) reported that two men came to the Prophet (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) who had accepted Islam at the same time. One of them used to partake in Jihad more-so than the other, and so (one day) he fought in a battle and was martyred therein. The other remained behind him for another year, and then he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said, ‘I saw in my dream that I was at the door of Paradise when behold, I was with both of them (the two men). Someone came out of Paradise and allowed the man who passed away later to enter first. Then he came out again and allowed the martyred one to enter. Then he returned and said to me, <em>‘Go back, for your time has not come yet.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha woke up and began to inform others about this and they were all surprised. This reached the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) and when they informed him of it, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>من أي ذلك تعجبون؟ قالوا: يا رسول اللهّ هذا كان أشد الرجلين اجتهاداً ثم استشهد ودخل هذا الآخر الجنة قبله فقال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وسلم) : أليس قد مكث هذا بعده سنة؟ قالوا: بلى. قال: أدرك رمضان فصام وصلى كذا وكذا من سجدة في السنة؟ قالوا: بلى. قال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وسلم): فما بينهما أبعد مما بين السماء والأرض</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><strong>‘What are you surprised about?’</strong></em> They said, <em>‘O Messenger of Allah! Out of them both, this one strove harder (in Jihad) then he was martyred but this other one was entered into Paradise before him.’</em> The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) said,<em><strong> ‘Did he not remain behind him for one year?’</strong></em> They said, <em>‘Yes (he did).’</em> He said, <em><strong>‘<span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-5j" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">Did he not reach Ramadan, fast and pray with such and such number of prostrations in the year?</span></a></span>’</strong></em> They said, <em>‘Yes.’ </em>The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><strong>‘<span style="color:#008000;">So the difference between them is greater than what is between the heavens and the earth</span>.’</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Sahih narration from Ibn Majah (2/345, 346) and al-Albani’s ‘al-Silsilah al-Sahihah’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Make the most of Ramadan, we seriously don’t realise its greatness, worth and reward.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">al-Aqalliyaat al-Muslimah &#8211; Page 84, Fatwa No.23</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">Should we fast and end our fast according to the sighting of the new moon in Saudi Arabia or should we do it according to the sighting of the new moon in the country where we are?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are as many as six different opinions amongst the scholars concerning this issue. However, there are two main points of view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">The first is that everyone should sight the moon in their own country and those countries </span><strong style="text-align:justify;">where the moon rises at the same time should follow them</strong><span style="text-align:justify;">. The reason for this is that the time at which the moon rises, varies from place to place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">The second opinion is that the beginning of the new month need only be confirmed in any one of the Muslim countries. If the sighting of the new moon is confirmed in any Muslim country, it is then obligatory for all Muslims to use that sighting to begin the fast of Ramadhaan or end it. According to this last opinion, if the new month is confirmed in Saudi Arabia it is obligatory upon all Muslims, in all parts of the world, to fast if it is the beginning of Ramadhaan and to end their fast if it is the beginning of Shawwaal. This is the most common opinion held by the followers of the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the first opinion is more correct</strong></span> because of the evidence in the Qur&#8217;aan, Sunnah and because of analogy. With regards to the Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">{The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;aan, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever witnesses the month should fast it&#8230;},</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah, Aayah 185].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last sentence is a conditional sentence, and the ruling contained in a conditional sentence is established for whomever the condition applies to and it is annulled for anyone for whom the condition does not apply. So the sentence: <span style="color:#008000;">«Whoever witnesses the month should fast it»</span> implies that whoever does not witness it does not fast it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known amongst astronomers that the time the moon rises differs from place to place. The moon might be seen in one place and not in another. Therefore, according to the verse, whoever does not see it is not obliged to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to the Sunnah, the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«If you sight it (the new moon of Ramadaan), then fast and if you sight it (the new moon of Shawaal),then end the fast. And if it is obscured from you, then complete thirty days (of Sha&#8217;baan»).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> «<strong><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-49" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">If you sight it</span></a></strong></span><span style="color:#008000;">».</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He therefore linked the ruling to the sighting and if a ruling is linked to an effective cause, then that ruling is annulled in the absence of that cause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">With regards to analogy, we say that in as much as the times for beginning the fast and breaking the fast every day vary from place to place so, in the same way, the times for the beginning and ending of the monthly fast also vary. We here in Riyadh, for example, begin our fast every day before the people in Al-Hijaaz and we also break our fast before they do. It is, therefore, obligatory upon us to start fasting while they are still eating. On the other hand, at the end of the day we are eating while they are still fasting. If, therefore, each place has its own ruling due to the variation in the time that the sun rises and sets, the same also applies due to the variation in the time that the moon rises and sets.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the answer to the question is clear. It is obligatory for you to follow the sighting of the new moon in the place where you are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas, radi Allahu anhu, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were sitting in the presence of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam one day and he said, &#8216;A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with water from wudoo and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then next day the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam again said words of similar import and again this person appeared in the same condition, so when Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam left, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-Aas followed this person and said, &#8216;Indeed I have abused my father and I swear that I would not go to him for three days so if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas continued saying, &#8220;So &#8216;Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was <strong>when he turned sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make takbeer and would do this until he stood for fajr prayer</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;<strong>Except that I never hear him speak except good</strong>&#8216;. So when the three days were over I was eager to make little of his actions. I said, &#8216;O servant of Allah there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me but I heard Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam saying on three occasions, &#8220;A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,&#8221; and you arrived on those three occasions, so I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say what he said?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that <strong>I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This hadith is authentic and classified as hassan. It is narrated in Musnad Imam Ahmed, and Albazar as well as others in many different chains.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (rahimahullah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sin may be more beneficial for a person, <strong>if</strong> it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;How is that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation.<br />
And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears Allah and feels shy before Him and feels humiliated before Him, hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret, seeking he forgiveness of his Lord. Each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people. Undoubtedly this sin is better before Allah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others, and who thinks that he is doing Allah a favour. Even if he says words that indicate something other than that, Allah is the Witness over what is in his heart. Such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him. If he were to examine himself honestly, he would see that clearly.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A statement that does not begin with praise of Allah and blessing upon me, remains deficient and bereft of blessings.&#8221; <strong>(Abu Dawud, 13/184)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same has been narrated about <em>Bismillah</em> also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic letter <em>Baa</em> in <em>Bismillah </em>stands for seeking help. From a syntactical point of view it relates to a noun or verb dropped by aphasia. The Quran contains examples of its relationship with both verb and noun. The example of verb is <em>Iqra bism-e-rabbika</em> (Read: &#8220;In the Name of your Lord&#8230;&#8221;) and the example of noun is <em>Bismillah-e-majreha</em> (In the Name of Allah will be its moving course).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hamd</em> means praising orally a grace regardless of being benefited by it, be it a favour or anything else, such as a statement that &#8216;I did <em>Hamd</em> of a certain person in connection with the prize he had been awarded or for his feat of boldness.&#8217; <em>Shukr</em> (thanking) is that praise which is done orally or emotionally or by any other organ of the body in lieu of some favour. This shows that the word <em>Hamd</em> is commonly used in one situation and the <em>Shukr </em>in another situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the mutual difference between<em> Hamd </em>and <em>Madh</em> (praise) Ibn Al-Qaiyim writes that<em> Hamd</em> denotes stating qualities with love and respect; and <em>Madh</em> denotes only declaration of the quality, it does not necessarily imply love and respect. That is why the connotation of<em> Hamd</em> is of a special nature and that of <em>Madh</em> a general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the word<em> Al-Hamdu</em>, the prefix <em>Al </em>has been used comprehensiveness meaning that it includes all forms of <em>Hamd. </em>Some people have described it as a generic noun and have maintained that perfect <em>Hamd</em> is affirmed only for Allah. This word shows that Allah has all the Attributes of perfection and beauty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Source</strong>: The Islamic View Point on Celebrations Mawlid, The Night of Isra and Miraj , Mid Shaban Night &#8211; by <strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The night wherein the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj occurred had not been particularized in the authentic Hadith. All that was in this concern, according to the scholars of Hadith, has not been asserted as valid by the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Such is the extensive judiciousness of the Almighty Allaah that He made people forget it. Even if its particularization had been asserted, Muslims should have not favoured it with any devotional services whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not permitted to celebrate its anniversary, since the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his companions –May Allaah be pleased with them- never did it. Neither did they favour it with certain acts of devotion. Should such celebration of the Night be a licit matter, the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have expounded it to the nation, either by word or by deed. And if such a thing had occurred, it would have been known and become common, and the companions-may Allaah be pleased with them- would have transmitted it to us. They, in fact, passed on from their Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), everything Muslims are in need of. Never were they remiss with regard to religion, nay, they were outstrippers to every good. Should celebration of this anniversary Night were licit, they would have been the first to do it. The Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is most sincere in guiding people. He most truly fulfilled his mission, and performed his noble duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the glorification and celebration of that Night had something to do with Islam, the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have never neglected it. Neither would he have concealed it. And since nothing of such a matter have ever occurred, it has become known that glorification and celebration of that Night has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Islam, because the Almighty Allaah has perfected for this nation its religion, completed His favour upon it, and rebuked the innovators who introduce in religion that which Allaah had not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty-glory be to Him- says in the Quranic Chapter Al-Ma’ida: (This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion).[5:3]. Allaah –may He be exalted- also says in Chapter Al-Shura: (What! Have they partners [godhead], who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allaah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgement, the matter would have been decided between them [at once]. But verily the wrongdoers will have a grievous Penalty). Warning against heresies, and declaring that they are errors by way of reminding the nation of their gruesome peril, and estranging people from committing them, have been established as valid in the authentic Hadith of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been asserted as valid, among other traditions, in both Sahih Muslim and Sahih Al-Bukhari, on the authority of A’isha –may Allah be pleased with her- that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: (If anyone introduces into this affair of ours anything which does not belong to it, it is rejected). In another version by Muslim, the Prophet said: (Whoever performs a deed inconsistent with our principles, it will be rejected). Muslim transmitted in his Sahih, on the authority of Jabir-may Allaah be pleased with him- that the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was always used to saying in his speech on Fridays: (and now to our topic; the best speech is that of the Quran, and the best guidance is that of Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the most wicked matter is that of heretic innovations and each heresy is an error). It is reported in the Sunan (precepts) on the authority of Al-‘irbad ibn Sariah-may Allaah be pleased with him-who said: the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), gave us an eloquent exhortation that scared the hearts, and shed tears from the eyes. We said: O Apostle of Allah, it looks as if it were a farewell exhortation. Admonish us. He then said: “I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey your commander even if he were a slave; for those of you who live after me will see great disagreement. You must therefore follow my Sunnah and that of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold to it, and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties; for every novelty is an innovation, and every innovation is an error). The traditions to that effect are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caution and intimidation against heresies have been established as a matter of fact, on the authority of the companions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the pious ancestors thereafter. Such was the case only for its being an unnecessary addition to religion, a prescription of something novel without the permission of Allaah, and an imitation of the adversaries of Allaah, as did the Jews and the Christians with regard to making additions to their religion, and inventing what was beyond the permission of Allaah, since that act of theirs was attended by their being prejudicial to Islamic religion, and accusing it of lack of perfection. This matter is quite known to be rife with a great deal of gross corruption, ignominious file actions, contradiction with the saying of the Almighty Allaah: (<strong>This day I have perfected your religion for you…</strong>.), and an obvious contrast to the traditions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that caution against, and estrange from heresies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that the aforementioned evidences are quite enough for the truth-seeker to reject this heresy, namely, that of celebrating the anniversary Night of ‘Isra’ and Mi’raj, and to caution against it, considering that it has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. In view of the fact that Allaah has enjoined the duty to give Muslims sincere advice, to elucidate the divine prescription for them, and to proscribe concealing of knowledge to them, I decided to call the attention of my Muslim brethren to this heresy which became so rife in a lot of countries that some people deemed it pertaining to religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He held the position of Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia, the Presidency of many Islaamic Committees and Councils, the prominent among these being: Senior Scholars Committee of the Kingdom, Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa, the Founding Committee of Muslim World League, World Supreme Council for Mosques, Islaamic Jurisprudence Assembly Makkah; and the member of the Supreme Council of the Islaamic University at al-Madeenah, and the Supreme Committee for Islaamic Propagation, until he passed away on Thursday 27 Muharram 1420 A.H./May 13 1999 C.E. May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) have Mercy upon his soul, aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=":1nu">
<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">Source: From  &#8220;al-Waabil as-Sayyib&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the authority of Suhaib (may Allaah be pleased with him) he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Amazing is the affair of the believer, verily all of his affair is good and this is not for no one except the believer. If something of good/happiness befalls him he is grateful and that is good for him. If something of harm befalls him he is patient and that is good for him&#8221;</em> </span>(Saheeh Muslim #2999)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this we understand that the state of affairs for the believer changes in the life of this world. Shaykhul Islaam ibn Qayyim al-Jawzeeyah (may Allaah have mercy upon him) said regarding the state of affairs for the believer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>One of them</strong> is the state of (receiving a) blessing. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to display) the gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is the state (of being) tested. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to observe) the patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third:</strong> is the state (of committing) a sin. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state to seek the forgiveness from it (the sin).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant does not go outside of the fluctuation between these three states.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is either a blessing or a virtue from Allaah of good health, wealth, a child to other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him that he thanks Allaah for this bounty. Let the servant contemplate over the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8221; ٱعۡمَلُوٓاْ ءَالَ دَاوُ ۥدَ شُكۡرً۬اۚ وَقَلِيلٌ۬ مِّنۡ عِبَادِىَ ٱلشَّكُورُ &#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Work you, O family of Dâwud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221;</em> </span>(surah Sabaa: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So how many of those whom Allaah has favored them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآ‌ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ۬ رَّحِيمٌ۬&#8221;<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you would count the favours of Allâh, never could you be able to count them. Truly! Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span> </em>(surah an-Nahl: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">How many show thanks to Allaah for these favours? Less than a few!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or there is a (state of being) tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him in this state (to observe) the patience. Meaning that Allaah from His overwhelming wisdom He could test the believing servant from the different types of test. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him to (observe) the patience because this is from the belief in the divine decree and from submitting the the decree of Allaah. Also (the servant must know) that what has befalling him was never going to pass him by. All of that is written in the book of Allaah (al-Lawhul-Mahfooth). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Verily Allah doesn&#8217;t test him (the servant) to destroy him. He only test him in order to test his patience and servitude</span>. Verily there is for Allaah upon the servant servitude in times of hardship just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in times of happiness. There also is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) dislikes just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) loves. Most of the creation give the servitude in that which they love. However the matter is giving the servitude in that which there is his hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other state is (a state of) sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him (the servant) in this state to seek the forgiveness this is clear with regards to the obligation of turning to Allaah (repentance) displaying ones need for him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion, because we have heard that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">they put their money in foreign banks, or quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba</span></strong>. If this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin, because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/question no. 119).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Don&#8217;t miss to read the below interesting analysis :</strong> (excerpted from the net)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Take the top 500 corporate giants of India</strong> which are basically engaged in <em>Halal</em> business and their end products and services too are <em>Halal.</em> One shall be astonished to look at the capital structure of these companies as more than half of the capital of these companies comes from debt instruments such as interest carrying debentures, secured loans and other borrowing from commercial banks and financial institutions. In fact a company is said to be based upon strong fundamentals whose debt-equity ratio is in the range of 60:40 to 70:30. And nearly all these 500 companies conform to this criterion mostly. The moot point here is can a company be bracketed under <em>Halal</em> business concerns just because its finished goods and services are <em>Halal</em> even though the majority of its capital and finance comes from debt and interest-carrying loans. Take these top 500 <em>Halal</em> companies again. It is a bare fact that these companies park their reserves and surplus capital in high-yield and fixed income debt instruments and government securities. And sometimes the returns from these investments far exceed the income from their declared business. Corporate giant, Tata Iron and Steel Company which is ranked second in terms of market capitalization and weightage on the Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange is a classic case whose main income in the early 90’s came from such investments under the sub-head “Other Income”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Viewed from yet another angle, a good company’s capital, as stated earlier, mainly consists of nearly 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent debt. At times of boom in the economy, companies usually earn more than 100 per cent on their investments. But they pay back their debtors only the pre-determined interest of say 20 per cent and pass the benefit of the remaining 80 per cent to their equity share holders besides their own 100 per cent entitlement. Under this scenario the profit-sharing of the debtors and the equity share holders would be 20 per cent and 220 per cent respectively. Conversely, at times of economic recession, companies could hardly earn anything, and even the debt servicing has to be met with from the share of the equity share-holders such as company reserves and further borrowing. In the former case if the equity share holders get abundantly benefited from the <em>Haram</em> investment of the debtors, in the latter case, it is the turn of their <em>Halal</em> investment to get the raw deal at the hands of the <em>Haram</em> one. The fundamental question here is does Islam permit the intermingling of <em>Halal</em> and <em>Haram</em> investments with such dire consequences, and that too of the present magnitude? The plain and unambiguous answer is a simple “no”. How can the stock-market trading be termed <em>Halal</em> then?</p>
