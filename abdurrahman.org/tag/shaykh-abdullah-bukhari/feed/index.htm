<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">What should a servant do when he is tried with a sin and he repents from it with a repentence where these three affairs (conditions) are fulfilled. But (then) he struggles with his heart regarding that sin, only to find that he fell into it (again).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Abdirraheem al-Bukhaaree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. I say: a sincere tawbah (repentance) requires an effort. Now, there is no command or prohibition &#8211; as Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said &#8211; except that Shaytaan (the devil) has two incitements regarding it: either to extremism or to negligence. He (i.e. Shaytaan) doesn&#8217;t care by which of these two he becomes victorious [over the servant]! The important thing (to him) is that you leave the Straight Path. Also, from his ways is that he doesn&#8217;t want you to be steadfast upon tawbah. He doesn&#8217;t want this! Because if you &#8211; the one he (Shaytaan) led astray and made fall into sin &#8211; are steadfast upon sincere tawbah and you adhere to obedience, he (Shaytaan) loses! Right? And this makes him feel very outraged, because he swore by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (Iblees (Shaytaan)) said: &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your sincere slaves amongst them (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38: 82-83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. Shaytaan beautifies the sin, this is why it has been narrated in the two Saheehs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Paradise is surrounded by things which are disliked and Hellfire is surrounded by desires (temptations).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this affair requires one to strive hard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you must show Allaah that you are truthful!! And this is a kind of test: you repent sincerely, and then the soul which commands evil entices you. So then you are in a struggle between your soul which commands evil and your self-reproaching soul. This is a test to see if your repentance is truthful, if your intention is correct and if you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [this sin]. Just as it is obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in [performing] that which is commanded, it is also obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in leaving [the prohibitions]. It is obligatory that you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [sins]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, O beloved one! From the greatest means that lead to the servant being deprived of succes, is commiting sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We supplicate to the One Who is worshipped (Allaah) during every distress, then we forget Him when the distresses are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can we hope for an answer to our supplications, while we closed its path with sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I consider a man to have forgotten the knowledge that he learned because of a sin he commits.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Hilyah by Abu Nu&#8217;aym]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should beware! This is why the look is an arrow from the arrows of Iblees, so a person should not continue looking, [listening to] whisperings, [listening to] suggestions [of Shaytaan], listening or other than that. So the more a person continues, the more he increases, and it is feared for him that Raan will cover his heart, about which Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn. </strong>[83:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge with Allaah! So beware! Sins are dangerous, by Allaah, O brothers! Dangerous and significant! And do not belittle [sins] by saying: “This is an insignificant sin,” “Is it from the minor or major sins?” Beware! In al-Bukhaaree on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You people do (bad) deeds (commit sins) which seem in your eyes tinier than hair, while we used to consider those (very deeds) during the life-time of the Prophet as destructive sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: Whenever you are truthful to Allaah in seeking refuge with Him and throwing yourself with humility before Him with repentance and returning back, He will make you steadfast, He will help you, He will give you success and He will take away from you the most evil of evils, the plot of the sinners and the most evil calamities of the day and night. But whenever you continue [listening to] whisperings and suggestions [of Shaytaan], Shaytaan will cause you to backslide. So beware!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, the fact that the servant always talks to himself (i.e. reviews himself), that he is aware that Allaah always watches over him in all of his deeds and movements and that he seeks nearness to Him by staying away from sins: this is a proof of his truthfulness, with the permission of Allaah. This heat that you feel because of this struggle in the inside, will result in coldness, certainty and security for you, if you are truthful to Allaah. This is why Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are truthful (in words and deeds). </strong>[9:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being truthful in words and deeds is a must! In words and deeds! And from the greatest of this, is that we are truthful to Allaah when we seek His forgiveness and when we return back to Him, the Majestic and Mighty! Is this clear, O brothers? So beware of continuing! Strive against your soul!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: it is only a small amount of days. The Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said, as mentioned in as-Saheeh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Victory is only an hour of patience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shaytaan requires struggle (Jihaad)! Right? He requires a great struggle! You have to struggle against him night and day! And the Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; has informed us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When any one of you goes to sleep, Shaytaan ties three knots at the back of his neck, and says: &#8220;You have a long night, so sleep.&#8221;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaytaan is with you! And he wages war against you from every place! It is not possible for you to be saved from him, except by seeking refuge with Allaah. This is why Allaah commanded you to seek help from Him and to seek refuge with Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of the daybreak.&#8221; </strong>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[114:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the noble, merciful Prophet &#8211; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to mankind &#8211; advised you, guided you, directed you and clarified to you the Path of salvation, which is adhering to the Sunnah:  the adhkaar (supplications) for the morning and the evening <strong>[1]</strong>, the adhkaar for entering and leaving the toilet, sleeping, eating, drinking, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Review yourself! I say: review yourself and examine yourself: are you from those who are steadfast upon the Sunnah or negligent regarding it? How should you call yourself to account except in this way? And praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! Praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! And I have mentioned this to the students and brothers, here or in a previous lesson &#8211; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How should this (calling oneself to account) happen? You have a notebook and a pen with you, and you want to know? Call yourself to account before you are called to account! You have a notebook with you [and you write]: Bismillaahi ar-Rahmaani ar-Raheem. Today, saturday or sunday. We start from Fajr; did you wake up before Fajr or after Fajr? [Mention this] to yourself, not in the radio! Did I wake up in time? Did I catch the Sunnah of Fajr or not? Of course before this [you mention]: have I prayed witr or not? Yes/no. Did I pray Fajr in congregation? Yes. Did I catch Takbeeratul-Ihraam? Yes/no. Have I said the adhkaar after the prayer <strong>[2]</strong>? Yes/no. The adhkaar for the morning and the evening? Yes/no. Did I recite my (daily) part of the Qur&#8217;aan? Etc, etc etc. Did I backbite? Have I commited something prohibited? Write down! You will see in the end of the day that you have [written] pages! Yes, no, yes, no&#8230; Review [yourself]!Yes: I stay upon the truth. No: review it the next day; are you still upon this or have you left it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, this affair is significant! It is not trivial!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>..in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years. </strong>[70:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, it is a must that we prepare an answer for this Day! We ask Allaah to be kind and gentle to us and you, to give us and you a good ending and to make us all steadfast upon Islaam and Sunnah. And may Allaah raise the rank of the Messenger of Allaah, his family and his Companions and grant them peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong> Authentic adhkaar for the morning and the evening</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2]</strong> Authentic adhkaar to be said after the obligatory prayer</p>

Video Courtesy : Brother Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What is) the way to strive against the soul [Inside] that is ever commanding [One] to do Evil?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdullah Al-Bukhaaree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive against It.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who strive for Our sake [from the Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam, his companions, and those who followed their way], We will most certainly show them our paths. [Al-&#8216;Ankabut 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person is such that it is a must that he strive against himself. It is well known that the Nafs al-Ammarah bi-l-Su&#8217; [the soul inside that is ever commanding one to do evil] takes him here and there. So it is upon him to remember that Allah, Majestic and All-High, sees him and has full knowledge of him. He knows the eyes that betray trusts and that which the chests keep hidden. And that He, Majestic and All-High [is such that] nothing at all escapes Him. So it is upon him to keep bringing to his mind at all times that Allah sees him and has full knowledge of him; that he fear Him; that he repent to Allah; that he push his soul to do good, always and ever; and that he strive his utmost against it to do acts of obedience [to Allah] and make it remain upon acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he hears the call [to prayer], he gets up and aims to beat others to the mosque; and he prays, if it&#8217;s the time for performing one of known routine [Sunnah prayers] or the like of that; he prays [general] voluntary [prayers]; he recites Qur&#8217;an; he is ready in the first line [of the congregation], and in this manner, he strives against his soul. And he recites the Qur&#8217;an, memorizes from it what he is able to, and shows eagerness to gain [Islamic] knowledge- he strives his utmost against his soul. If he were to tame it just a little, the soul would get tamed: It&#8217;s over, it would give in to him. But it needs to be checked on always, on an ongoing basis. Always, and on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let him not feel secure from Allah’s long plan [that sinners enjoy for a time but finally get the punishment they deserve]. And let him not feel secure from Allah&#8217;s long plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah Al-Aiim [the Exalted], Lord of the Great Throne, that He make us and you from those who listen to a speech and follow the best of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#888888;">[The following is a summary of an extremely beneficial portion of a highly beneficial advice the shaikh gave a few years ago]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah al-Bukhaaree said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <strong>Saved Sect</strong>, who are also this <strong>Aided and Victorious Group</strong>, those who are upon this blessed da&#8217;wah, they are known through different characteristics and signs. We will mention the most important of them, as a summary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the people of The Saved Sect are upon the <strong>manhaj of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) after him.</strong> They are not upon anything else. This is a summary, the answer in brief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In detail [the shaikh mentioned <strong>nine</strong> points:]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From the main characteristics of what distinguish The Saved Sect and those who adhere to it is that they are those who establish <strong>servitude to Allaah alone</strong>. And they [establish] the Deen <strong>sincerely</strong> for Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala. They worship Allaah alone, not associating anyone or anything with Allaah in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- They single out the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in <strong>ittiba&#8217; (following)</strong>. They follow the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- They adhere to the <strong>understanding of the Salaf-us-Saleh (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum)</strong>, the righteous predecessors. And we have [already] brought to you the adila (the proofs) from the legislation, wherein we are commanded to adhere to the way of the Salaf-us-Saleh, and we have been prohibited from going against that which they were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- To beware of and warn <strong>against bid&#8217;ah and Innovators, and sin and sinners.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- Al-Waasatiyah (adhering to the <strong>middle course</strong> in this religion) between the two extremes &#8211; al-ghuloo (going beyond the boundaries) and jafaa` (negligence).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- They are <strong>firm upon the haqq (truth)</strong> and adhere to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- They are so eager and diligent and concerned to be united in the most harmonious way upon the truth &#8211; upon the Book and the Sunnah. And you find them <strong>against division and differing</strong>. They call the people to be united and kind and gentle with one another and to have harmony, and likewise they call against division and differing. And they do all this upon the truth, while using the truth itself. So they call to the true unity upon the truth, using the truth itself to call to it. Not any [kind of] unity [such as the people of bid&#8217;ah &#8211; such as Ikhwanul Muslimeen &#8211; who call to uniting upon falsehood]. And they warn against division and differing, in truth &#8211; using the truth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- They constantly busy themselves with <strong>seeking knowledge, the beneficial knowledge</strong>. They learn beneficial knowledge of this Deen, and they disseminate it amongst the people and call to it, (and) while doing all this &#8211; learning, disseminating and calling &#8211; they are patient upon the harms they may encounter and face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- <strong>Acting upon the knowledge</strong>, not just having knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are so many proofs from the revelations [Qur`an and Sunnah] and the Seerah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions, and the Imams of this religion. They&#8217;re all proof to what we mentioned. From all these proofs, I will choose only one, a great hadeeth that comprehensively comprises all that we have mentioned &#8211; the <strong>hadeeth of Al-&#8216;Irbaad ibnu Saariyah (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu)</strong>, which we mentioned earlier. However, in sha` Allaah, there will be a benefit in repeating this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al &#8216;Irbaad bin Saariyah (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) admonished us one day after the early morning prayer. The admonition was heartfelt and eloquent and caused the eyes to shed tears and the hearts to tremble. A man from amongst us said, &#8216;Certainly, it is as if this is a farewell admonition, so with what do you advise us, O Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam)? He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I advise you to fear Allaah, and to listen and obey those in authority over you even if it were a slave. Indeed, whoever from amongst you lives long will witness much differing. So incumbent upon you is my sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly-guided khulafaa (Caliphs) after me. Bite onto it with your molar teeth. And beware of newly invented matters (in the religion), for verily every newly invented matter (in the religion) is a bid&#8217;ah, and every bid&#8217;ah is a misguidance.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate carefully upon this great hadeeth that comprises all these characteristics of this noble methodology that distinguish The Saved Sect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- It includes the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) advising us with Taqwa, and by achieving <strong>Taqwa</strong> you will achieve the &#8216;<strong>Uboodiyah</strong> (the worship of Allaah alone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And it includes the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) commanding us with his Sunnah, this means that you single out the Prophet in following, and he is to be followed in this Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- And it includes the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) advising us with following the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khulafa (Caliphs), and in it is a command to follow their understanding, the understanding of the Salaf-us-Saleh, as has already preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- And it includes the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) warning against bid&#8217;ah. We take from that to beware and warn against bid&#8217;ah and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That you understand the Sunnah [the whole Deen] with the understanding of the Salaf-us-Saleh; this is how you will be from those people who always stay on the middle course, not to fall into one extreme or the other. Likewise, it is taken from the statement of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam): Whoever from amongst you lives long will witness much differing. &#8212;&gt; This difference is due to either one extreme or the other &#8211; Ghuloo and Jafaa`.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- Warning against division, that division and separation that is blameworthy. This is taken from the Prophet&#8217;s statement: Whoever from amongst you lives long will witness much differing&#8230; So therefore, the one who holds firmly onto the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam), he is saved from differing and division. And from that also is the command to be united upon the truth &#8211; also taken from the Prophet&#8217;s statement: So incumbent upon you is my sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly-guided khulafaa (Caliphs) after me. Bite onto it with your molar teeth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known, my dear brothers, that these characteristics and these <strong>beautiful distinguishing points of The Saved Sect</strong>, it is impossible to put them into application without beneficial knowledge. Ibnu Taymeeyah (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">All good and rectification and perfection is limited to beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if someone wants good and rectification and reform that is correct, it is limited and restricted to beneficial knowledge and acting upon it with righteous actions&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah al-Bukhaaree had said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Saved Sect are pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Islaam as a religion, and Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) as a Prophet and Messenger.</span></p>
