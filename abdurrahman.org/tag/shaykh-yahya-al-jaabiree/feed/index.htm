<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Bismillah wa -Alhamdulillah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Friday 30th January, <i>Muwahhideen</i> Publications in conjunction with<i>Islam.tt </i>and <i>Imam-Malik.net</i> hosted a LIVE tele-lecture with <i>Shaykh Yahyaa al-Jaabiree</i> (May <b>Allah</b> Preserve Him) entitled, “The Types of <i>Hijrah</i>” as part of the webinar, “The Obligation of The <i>Muslims</i> Towards The Non-<i>Muslims</i>in The West”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>This lecture event was translated LIVE into English.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah</b> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And as for those who emigrated for the Cause of Allah, after suffering oppression, We will certainly give them goodly residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater, if they but knew!&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah an-Nahl 16:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <i>“Hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases, and repentance will not cease until the sun rises from the West.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• He (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) likewise stated:<i> “There is no Hijrah after the Conquest (of Makkah), but instead Jihaad and (good) intention.”</i> i.e. Hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, because Makkah had become a land of Islaam and this is a glad tiding that it will remain as such until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <i>Hijrah </i>is an obligation upon those who have the ability to do so. If they are unable an exception is made for them. <b>Allah</b> mentions in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. For these there is hope that Allah will forgive them, and Allah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:98-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Whoever finds a <i>Muslim </i>land that will accept him, then it is obligatory for him to emigrate. And whoever does not find a place that would allow him to live there, he should remain in his country and practice his <i>Deen </i>to the best of his ability and treat the people in the best way and not cause the disbelievers to have any animosity towards the <i>Muslims </i>due to his bad actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord (<i>Subhaanahu wa Ta’aalaa</i>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And say to My slaves that they should (only) say those words that are the best. (Because) Shaytaan verily, sows disagreements among them Surely, Shaytaan is to man a plain enemy.&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah al-Israa` 17:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and al-Masaakeen (the poor), and speak good to people”</i></b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not because we have some special love for the non-<i>Muslims </i>because of their <i>Deen</i>, but in hope that they will be guided to <i>Islaam </i>and hope that some harm will be repelled form the <i>Muslims</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• From the types of <i>Hijrah </i>are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Leaving a land of bid&#8217;ah to a land of <i>Sunnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Leaving a land of sin and disobedience to a land where the people are righteous and obedient to <b>Allah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Leaving alone that which <b>Allah </b>has prohibited, as is found in the <i>hadeeth</i>of <i>‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas</i> (<i>radhiyAllahu ‘anhu</i>) that the Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <i>“The Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. And a Muhaajir is the one who abandons all that Allah has forbidden.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• It is befitting for the <i>Muslim </i>to abandon the places where <i>shirk</i>, sin and<i>bid’ah </i>are committed and to stay away from the people who commit those sins because they cause a deficiency in his <i>Deen</i>. And he should not take any knowledge from the people of <i>bid’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Regarding the third type of leaving alone something &#8211; which is the origin of the word &#8211; can be applied to shunning people. This can be done to <i>Muslims</i>if they have committed a sin and it would benefit them and cause them to recognise their sin and repent from it. The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) did this with <i>Ka’b Ibn Maalik </i>(<i>radhiyAllahu ‘anhu</i>) and others who stayed behind for the Battle of <i>Tabook</i>. The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not speak to them for 50 nights, so they would realise the severity of their sin until <b>Allah </b>revealed that He had accepted their repentance and forgiven them. <b>Allah </b>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhaajiroon (Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to al-Madeenah) and the Ansaar (Muslims of al-Madeenah) who followed him (Muhammad sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in the time of distress (Tabook expedition, etc.), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three [who did not join the Tabooûk expedition (whom the Prophet sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)] left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was suspended for Allah&#8217;s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He accepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.” </i></b>[Soorah at-Tawbah 9:117-118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• There were other people at that time that likewise stayed behind and they pretended to have a valid excuse when they did not and the Prophet accepted that at face value from them and did not rebuke them from it like the Companions who admitted they did not have an excuse; and <b>Allah</b>exposed those who were hypocrites. This type of <i>hijrah </i>(of shunning) applied to them and remained for 50 nights until <b>Allah </b>accepted their repentance. They benefited from this type of <i>hijrah</i>. They would walk around the market places full of people and no one would pay attention to them. When <b>Allah </b>revealed that He had accepted their repentance the Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said to <i>Ka’b</i>: <i>“Receive glad tidings of the best day upon you since your mother gave birth to you.”</i> <i>Ka’b </i>asked: “O Messenger of <b>Allah</b>, is this from you or from <b>Allah</b>?” to which the Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed him that it was from<b>Allah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• However, this type of refusing to talk to people is only applied if they would recognise their sin because of this. If shunning them would only cause them to go further away from the <i>Muslims </i>and go deeper into their sins and break away from the <i>jamaa’ah</i>, it is not to be done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) applied this to some people and to others he did not, which was based on their circumstances and if they would benefit from it or not.</p>
