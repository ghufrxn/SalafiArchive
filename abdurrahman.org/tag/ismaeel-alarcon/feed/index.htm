<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a unanimous agreement amongst Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah that it is an obligation to stick to the <strong>Jamaa&#8217;ah </strong>[1] and that it is forbidden to break away from it, and that sticking to it is a virtue while separating oneself away from it is a vice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, reaching the level of tawaatur, have been reported concerning this, and likewise there are many narrations from the Salaf with this regard. Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim [2] said: &#8220;My father narrated to me saying: &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Alee As-Sairafee informed me, saying: &#8216;Abdu Rabbihi Ibn Baariq Al-Hanafee &#8211; and he praised him with good &#8211; narrated to me, saying: Simaak Ibn Al-Waleed Al-Hanafee narrated to me that he met Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in Madeenah and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What do you say about a ruler who governs us, yet oppresses and abuses us, shall we not prevent him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8216;No, obey him, O Hanafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8216;O Hanafee, the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Jamaa&#8217;ah! Indeed, the nations that came before you were only destroyed because of their splitting up. Did you not hear Allaah say: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;'&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah said in his Tafseer:[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The expressions of the scholars of Tafseer have varied with regard to the meaning of this (part of the) ayah <b>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah.&#8217;</b> So Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas Ibn Maalik narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Indeed, the tribe of Israa&#8217;eel split up into seventy-one sects. And my ummah (nation) will split up into seventy-two sects &#8211; all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it was said to him: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which is this (saved) one?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) clenched his fist and said: <b>&#8216;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited the ayah: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together.&#8217;</b>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said in one of his khutbahs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;All of you together, adhere to obedience (of Allaah) and the Jamaa&#8217;ah, for indeed it is the Rope of Allaah that He has commanded us with.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah that He commanded us to hold onto is the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah refers to the Book of Allaah.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ad-Dahhaak also said this. And other things have been said, all of which are similar to what has been mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>jamee&#8217;an</i></b> (all of you together) is connected to the command &#8216;Itasimoo (Hold onto), so the meaning becomes: <b>&#8216;Be united upon your mutual holding of it (the Rope of Allaah).&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;And be not divided&#8217;</b> refers to the kind of division that leads to not uniting for Jihaad and for protecting the Religion and the Word of Allaah. This is the dividing that comes from tribulations (fitan) and dividing in matters of Creed.&#8221; [End of Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah&#8217;s words, rahimahullaah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that their differing on the tafseer of the part of the verse: <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> is a differing indicating variety in meaning, not a contradiction in meaning, as has been indicated here by Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah, Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr and other muhaqqiqeen. And his interpreting it to be the Book of Allaah combines all of the mentioned statements (of the Salaf). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubee mentioned in his Tafseer[6] the opinion of those who say that the <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> means the Qur&#8217;aan and the opinion of those who say it means the Jamaa&#8217;ah. Then he said: &#8220;The intended meanings are all close and similar for indeed Allaah commands unity and forbids division. This is since division is destruction while the Jamaa&#8217;ah is salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The <b>&#8216;Rope of Allaah&#8217;</b> has been interpreted as Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan), His Religion, Islaam, Sincerity, His Command, His covenant, Obedience to Him and as the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these sayings have been stated by the Companions and those who followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgement. And all of it is correct, for the Qur&#8217;aan commands towards the Religion of Islaam &#8211; and this is Allaah&#8217;s Command, His covenant and obedience to Him. And adhering to it <i>jamee&#8217;an</i> (in a unified group) can only be done with the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam in reality is Sincerity to Allaah.&#8221; [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it is understood that their sayings (i.e. of the Salaf) in their interpretation of <b>&#8220;The Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> are not contradictory of one another but rather each saying compliments the other such that Allaah&#8217;s intended meaning becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree reported in his Tafseer [8] that Qataadah said concerning the ayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be divided &#8211; and remember Allaah&#8217;s blessing on you.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah hates that you be divided &#8211; and He forbade you from it. And He loves that you hear and obey and (stick to) the Jamaa&#8217;ah. So love for yourselves what Allaah loves for you &#8211; if you are able. And there is no might except by (the leave of) Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">This was a three part question asked over Paltalk. The first two questions were about du&#8217;aa and and so they were left out and consequently the tape recording was edited and abridged to pertinent part only. The recording is not clear in some parts, which we have highlighted in the text with [&#8230;].</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> The youth would like your advice O Shaikh, on what our obligation is with regard to what is occurring currently in Palestine. May Allaah reward you! As-Salaam ‘Alaikum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> Wa ‘Alaika as-Salaam wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your third question, which is on directing the youth, or advising the youth concerning what is occurring in Palestine, then (we say that) Allaah knows that our hearts have become broken (over the current situation). However, we do not let our passions overtake us, rather we let the Sunnah direct us. And the Sunnah in this regard is to return the matter to those people who are capable of producing solutions and conclusions (<i>Ahlul Halli wal-‘Aqd</i>) – the leaders and rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for every Tom, Dick and Harry to speak his mind, because this falls into provoking and instigating turmoil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, I will mention the legislated principle that has been stated in the Noble Qur’aan, which is: <b>“And when a matter concerning (public) fear or security comes to them, they spread it (out to the people). But if they had only returned it back to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those who derive (the correct understanding) among them would have made (the matter) known (upon its correct understanding).”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, I warn the Muslim youth, specifically, and all the Muslims, generally, to not oppose this principle by instead accepting the call of these foolish speakers, who send messages asking for certain things which they have no right over, such as boycotting the purchase of American products, for example. Or they send letters over the commercial lines or by fax saying: “Give your support, Give your support!”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people are assuming a responsibility that they have no authority over. And furthermore, we, all praise be to Allaah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in the Gulf states and other neighboring states, as well as the Arab lands, are being ruled by Muslims from among us. We do not claim that they are infallible or that they are free from error. However, they are Muslims and there are scholars around them. And they have advisors from the scholars, judges, ministers, and those who have experience in law and politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to follow other than them, the command is solely for them…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise you to seek refuge in Allaah, by making supplication (for them) – that He alleviate their suffering and relieve them from their distress. And ask that He solve their dilemma and grant them victory over the Jews in the state of the Tribe of Isra’eel, as well as those who join sides with them, from the disbelievers and polytheists. This is the advice in brief and Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">l praise is for Allaah with much praises and blessings, as our Lord loves and is pleased with and as is required for attaining the honor of His most Sublime Face.[1] And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our teacher Muhammad, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, his family and his companions.</span>Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“Islaam began as something strange and it will return to being strange as it began. So Toobaa [2] is for the strangers.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have also reported this hadeeth on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with the addition at the end of it:<b>“It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who are the strangers?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘The Nuzaa’ (those who extract themselves) from their families and close relatives.’</b>” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Al-Aajuree also transmitted it and in his report there occurs: <b>&#8220;It was said: ‘Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘Those who rectify (themselves/others) when the people have become corrupt.’”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others have transmitted it with the following words, in which he, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;They are those who flee from trials (fitan) for the sake of their Religion.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhee reported it from the hadeeth of Katheer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Maznee on the authority of his father who reported from his grandfather that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Verily, this Religion began as something strange. And it will go back to being something strange. So Toobaa is for the strangers – those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me of my Sunnah.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been transmitted by At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of Jaabir, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, on the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And in the hadeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It was said: &#8216;And who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said: &#8216;They are those who rectify and make corrections when the people have become corrupted.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (At-Tabaraanee) also reported it from the hadeeth of Sahl Ibn Sa&#8217;ad, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with a similar wording.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad also transmitted it from the hadeeth of Sa’ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, on the authority of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And it is stated in the hadeeth: <b>“So Toobaa on that day will be for the strangers – when the people have become corrupt.”</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration transmitted by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, the Prophet,<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Toobaa is for the strangers.”</b> It was said: “And who are the strangers? He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are more numerous than those who obey them.”</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been reported on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, in marfoo’ and mawqoof [11] form in this hadeeth, that: “It was said: ‘Who are the strangers?’ He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘They are the ones who flee for the sake of their Religion. Allaah, may He be Exalted, will send them with ‘Eesaa Bin Maryam’”</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, statement: <b>“Islaam began as something strange”</b>, then it is referring to the people before his advent, who were upon widespread deviance. This is as the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“Indeed Allaah looked at the people of the earth and hated them, both Arabs and non-Arabs, except for some remnants that were from the People of the Book.”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling towards Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice &#8211; to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant. And they continued to be upon this condition during the times of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (during their Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaytaan (Devil) unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>) and<b>Desires</b> (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of Shaytaan was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from among them were those who entered into obedience to him by way of the evil of Doubts (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>). And from among them, were those who fell into the evil of Desires (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>). And from among them, were those who combined between them both. All of that was from what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, had warned us would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>As for the evil of Doubts:</b><br />
Then it has been reported on the Prophet through many paths of narration that his ummah would divide into more than seventy sects. This is based on the differing found in the reports concerning the exact number with which they will exceed the number seventy. And it is reported on him, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, that all of these groups will be in the Hellfire, except for one group – and it is that (group) which adheres to what he and his companions were upon (during their time). [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And as for the evil of Desires:</b><br />
It is reported in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“When the treasures of the Persians and the Romans are opened for you, how will your people be?”</b> ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf,<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, said: “We will say what Allaah has ordered us (to say).”[15] He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Or other than that. You will compete against each other, then you will envy one another, then you will turn your backs on one another.”</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree on the authority of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“I swear by Allaah! It is not poverty that I fear for you. Rather, what I fear the most for you is that the pleasures of this world will be presented to you as they were presented to those before you. And you will compete against each other for it, as they competed against each other. And it will destroy you, just as it destroyed them.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, a hadeeth from the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the treasures of Kissra (Chosroes) were opened for ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, he began to weep and said: <b>“Indeed this (treasure) did not open upon a people ever, except that Allaah placed discord between them.”</b> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to fear these two evils (of Doubts and Desires) for his ummah as has been reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad on the authority of Abu Barzah that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Indeed, I only fear for you the desires of transgression found in your stomachs and your private parts and the calamities (fitan) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> And in another narration there occurs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;and the desires (hawaa) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a majority of the people fell victim to either or both of these evils, they began to cut off ties with one another and they began to hate one another. This only came after them having been brothers, loving and supporting one another. Indeed the evil of <b>Desires</b> became something common and accepted amongst a majority of the creatures. And it tested people by way of the worldly life and its pleasures. So that became the goal of the people’s striving. They sought after it and became pleased with it. They became angry due to it and they hated for its sake and loved for its sake. Because of this, they would sever family relations and spill blood unlawfully. And for this purpose, they committed disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evil of <b>Doubts</b> and vain desires that lead astray, then it was because of this that the Muslims divided and became sects, some groups declaring others as disbelievers. Thus, they became enemies, divided into groups and parties. This only happened after having been brothers. Their hearts were united upon the heart of one man. So not one of all these sects is saved, except for the one saved sect (<i>Al-Firqat-un-Naajiyah</i>). And they are the ones mentioned in the saying of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who oppose them will not be able to harm them, nor will those who abandon them, until Allaah’s order comes about (Day of Judgment) and they are in that state.”</b>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be the strangers – the ones who have been mentioned in the previous ahaadeeth – during the Last Days. They are the ones who will correct others when the people have become corrupt. They are those who will rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah. They are the ones who will flee from affliction for the sake of their Religion. They are the ones who will extract themselves from their close relatives (for Allaah’s sake).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because they are so few that you will not find any among them in an entire tribe (family), except one or two. In some tribes, you will not find any of them, just as it was when the first people entered into Islaam. This is the way the majority of the scholars have explained this hadeeth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">FOOTNOTES:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] What is meant here is the attainment of Paradise in which the people who are granted it will be able to see the Face of Allaah, as has been stated in various texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] It is said that Toobaa means something good. Allaah mentions this word in Surat-ur-Ra’ad of His Final Revelation: <b>“Those who believe and do righteous deeds, Toobaa is for them and a pleasant destination.”</b> According to Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer (Abridged 1/281), Ibraaheem An-Nakha’ee (rahimahullaah), the great Taabi’ee, said it means “good is for them.” Qataadah said: “When a man says Toobaa for you it means you have attained something good. ‘Ikrimah and Mujaahid said that Toobaa means Paradise. And it is also said that Toobaa refers to a tree in Paradise which the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, spoke of when he said: <b>“Verily, there is a tree in Paradise under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred years without being able to cover (it’s distance) completely.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim] This is what seems to be indicated in the above hadeeth, due to another hadeeth reported on the Prophet, in which he said: <b>“Toobaa is a tree in Paradise. Its (shade’s) distance (in traveling) is one hundred years. And the garments of the inhabitants of Paradise will be extracted from its branches.”</b> Imaam Al-Albaanee graded it hasan in his Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 1985).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Muslim (1/130): See Sharh Saheeh Muslim of Imaam An-Nawawee (2/175-176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3988), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (5/18) and he said it was authentic, Musnad Ahmad (5/296). It has also been recorded by Al-Khattaabee in his <i>Ghareeb-ul-Hadeeth</i> (1/175). Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared it weak (<i>da&#8217;eef</i>) in his collection <i>Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 1273)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This hadeeth is also reported by Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee and it is saheeh as has been stated by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 1). However the hadeeth with a different wording from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Sanah is weak. See <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This hadeeth was reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Sunan (5/18) and he said it was saheeh. It was also reported by Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in <i>Al-Kaamil</i> (6/2080), At-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i>(17/16), Abu Nu&#8217;aim in <i>Al-Hilyah</i> (2/10) and Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in Al-Jaami&#8217; (1/112) as well as others. In his checking to the book <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> of Imaam Ash-Shaatibee (1/22), Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee said concerning At-Tirmidhee&#8217;s authentication of this hadeeth: &#8220;This is from the hadeeth that he, may Allaah have mercy on him, has overlooked. For indeed, Katheer (Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah) is very weak. Rather, Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee accused him of being a liar! And he described him with that (lying) as being one of his main supports, as occurs in<i>Manaaqib-ush-Shaafi&#8217;ee</i> of Al-Bayhaqee (1/547-548). This is a criticism (<i>jarh</i>) that reaches the highest level of severity. Thus his hadeeth are to be disregarded completely.&#8221; Therefore, the hadeeth is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) as is stated in <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 13) and <i>Da’eef Al-Jaami’-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 1441)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] This hadeeth has been reported by At-Tahaawee in <i>Mushkil-ul-Aathaar</i> (1/298), Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (2/112), and Al-Bayhaqee in <i>Az-Zuhd-ul-Kabeer</i> (200). Al-Haythamee attributed it to At-Tabaraanee in his book <i>Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278), saying: &#8220;In its chain is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih, the scribe of Laith, and he is weak. However, he has been declared reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] At-Tabaraanee reported this hadeeth in his <i>Kabeer</i> (6/164) and his <i>Sagheer</i> (1/104). Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278): &#8220;Its narrators are all of the standards of the Saheeh (collections), except Bakr Ibn Saleem, for he is reliable. Saleem Al-Hilaalee said in his checking of <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> (1/18): &#8220;Bakr Ibn Saleem is weak. However, he is used as a support during cases when hadeeth need to be backed up and supported. Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said in <i>At-Taqreeb</i>: &#8216;He is acceptable&#8217; meaning when a hadeeth needs to be supported. And if this is not the case, then he is layyin.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] This hadeeth is recorded by Imaam Ahmad, Al-Bazaar and Abu Ya’laa. Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id</i> (7/277): &#8220;Its narrators are the narrators of the standard of the Saheeh (collections).&#8221; Saleem Al-Hilaalee declared it saheeh in his <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Al-Haythamee (rahimahullaah) said in Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (7/278): &#8220;In its chain is Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and there is weakness in him.&#8221; The hadeeth can be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad (2/177). It is authentic due to its many paths of narration. Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;-us-Sagheer (no. 3291)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] A marfoo&#8217; hadeeth is a statement that has been reported by a companion, yet &#8220;raised&#8221; to the level of being a saying of the Prophet. A mawqoof hadeeth is a statement that is reported by a companion and &#8220;stopped&#8221;, meaning it ends up being only his statement, as opposed to being raised to a saying of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This hadeeth has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in mawqoof form, and by his son ‘Abdullaah in marfoo’ form. It can be found in <i>Az-Zuhd</i> (77149). The hadeeth is <i>da&#8217;eef</i> as has been clarified by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Saheeh Muslim (Eng.): vol. 4, no. 6853. What is meant by the remnants of the People of the Book are those who stuck to their religion upon truth without changing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This hadeeth has been reported from a number of different routes. Perhaps the one most similar to what the Shaikh (Ibn Rajab) is paraphrasing here is that which has been reported by At-Tabaraanee in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 724), in which the Prophet said: <b>&#8220;This ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in the Hellfire, except for one.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;And which is that sect?&#8221;</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;(The ones that adhere to) That which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</b> In another narration on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, the Prophet,<i> sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Every one of them will be in the Hellfire, except one and it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> And in another narration on the authority of Abu Sufyaan, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>: <b>&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, stood amongst us one day and said: &#8216;Indeed those before you from the People of the Book divided into seventy-two groups. And, indeed, this group (Muslims) will divide into seventy-three. Seventy-two groups will be in the Fire and one of them will be in Paradise. And it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.’&#8221; </b>This latter hadeeth was reported by Ahmad, Al-Haakim, Abu Dawood and others. Al-Haakim authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. At-Tirmidhee (no. 2641) also reported a similar hadeeth to it and graded it saheeh. Imaam Al-Albaanee listed all its paths of narrations and different wordings in his <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 204) and clarified that it is an authentic hadeeth without any doubt about its authenticity. In summary, the hadeeth and its additions are hasan due to its various paths of narrations, which serve as supporting evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] He means by this: We will praise Him, thank Him and ask Him for an increase in His Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Saheeh Muslim (no. 2962) and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3996)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (Eng.): vol. 5, no. 351</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Refer to <i>Al-Bidaayah-wan-Nihaayah</i> (7/70) of Ibn Katheer for an account of the event. It is recorded in his book under the section of the Battle of Jaloolaa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Imaam Ahmad (4/423) and others reported this hadeeth. Al-Manaawee said that it had a good chain in his book <i>Al-Jaami’-ul-Azhar</i> (1/146). Al-Albaanee graded it saheeh in his checking of <i>At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> (no. 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (4/252), Saheeh Muslim (no. 170), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (4/504), and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3952)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah says: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion. Verily, some (forms of) suspicion is sinful.&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the two Saheeh collections (of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim), Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <b>&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most false type of speech.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, holding bad thoughts for the Muslim leaders in their administrative actions and the decisions that they make is truly a door to evil, which leads the one who engages in it to fall into matters forbidden in the Religion. And it&#8217;s harm can spread to the general masses of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the door to holding bad thoughts about the actions enforced by the Muslim leaders is opened and each person begins to express his thoughts about these actions, the people fall into the suspicion that is condemned in the Religion. And each person is brought into the talk of that which doesn&#8217;t concern him and liking the he said/she said (gossip) which is forbidden in the Religion. And those who have no say in matters or bear any position of responsibility (with respect to leadership) will begin to voice themselves. All of this has a harmful effect upon the people collectively, for it is one of the ways of the Devil in causing catastrophes and warranting rebellion against the leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever leads to an evil consequence must be prevented even if it is something that is allowed (<i>mubaah</i>). So how much more so when the thing that leads to it is forbidden (in itself) and when the thing being led to is the source of evil?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Lateef</strong> and <strong>Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Abdil-&#8216;Azeez Al-&#8216;Anqaree</strong> said in a letter written [1] by them to the people during the time of the fitnah of the Ikhwaan against the king &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez, may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the things that the Devil causes to enter into some of the practicing Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Accusing the Muslim scholars of flattering and kissing up (to the leaders), suspicious thoughts (about them), and not taking (knowledge) from them. This is all a cause for one&#8217;s being prevented from beneficial knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another thing that the Devil puts into them is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Holding bad thoughts for the leader and failing to obey him. Indeed, this is from the greatest types of sins and it is from the ways of the people of Jaahiliyyah, those who did not hold hearing and obeying (the leader) as being part of the Religion. Rather, each of one of them followed his own opinion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences from the Book and the Sunnah clearly demonstrate the obligation of hearing and obeying the (Muslim) leader in times of hardship and times of ease and in things that one likes and things that one hates. This is such that he (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Hear and obey (the leader), even if he takes your money and whips your back.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is forbidden to disobey him and oppose him in his authority, in his relations, in his agreements and in his treaties, for he is a representative of the Muslims and looking out for what is in their best interests. And his looking out for them is better than their looking out for their own selves. This is since through his leadership, the order of the Religion remains established and the unity of the Muslims remains in tact.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially the case since Allaah has blessed you with a leader whose authority is that of religious authority. [2] And he has guided the masses of his subjects from the Muslims, especially the practicing ones amongst them, by being kind to them and building masaajid for them and sending out callers (du&#8217;aat) to them and overlooking their errors and acts of ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this existing in the last portion of these times is from the greatest bounties that Allaah has bestowed to the people of this (Arab) peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation upon them to be thankful for this bounty and to consider it. And they should support him and be loyal to him inwardly and outwardly. So it is not permissible for anyone to betray him, nor to carry out some matter except with his permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever betrays him with treason then he has strove to sow the seeds of dissension amongst the Muslims against him, and he has split away from the Jamaa&#8217;ah (main body of Muslims). The Prophet (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Whoever disobeys the Ameer (leader) has disobeyed me. And whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allaah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by the word Ameer in this hadeeth is the person whom Allaah has given authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and he is the greater Imaam.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Sahaabee</strong> (Companion) is anyone that met the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) while believing in him, and dying upon that condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions (<strong>Sahaabah</strong>) of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) are the best from all those that accompanied the prophets, due to the statement of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): “The best of people are my Companions.” [1] Al-Bukhaaree and others have reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Sahaabah are the <strong>Muhaajiroon</strong> (those who performed the migration from Makkah to Madeenah), due to their combining between migrating and giving support (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause). Then after them, are the <strong>Ansaar</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Muhaajiroon are the <strong>four righteous Khaleefahs</strong>: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Bakr</strong> &#8211; He is &#8220;<strong>As-Siddeeq</strong>&#8221; ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Aamir from the Tribe of Taym bin Marrah bin Ka’ab. He was the first male to believe in the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). He was his companion in the migration (Hijrah) and his deputy during times of prayer and Hajj. He was his Khaleefah (designated successor) for his nation. Five of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise accepted Islaam through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are ‘Uthmaan, Az-Zubair, Talha, ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf and Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqaas. He died in Jumaadal-Al-Akhirah, in the 13th year of Hijrah, when he was 63 years old. The above five along with Abu Bakr, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib and Zayd bin Haarithah form the eight that were the first of people to accept Islaam. Ibn Ishaaq stated this and what he meant by it, was that they were the first from amongst the males, after (the advent of) the Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Umar</strong> &#8211; He is Abu Hafs &#8220;<strong>Al-Faarooq</strong>&#8221; ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab from the tribe of ‘Adiyy bin Ka’ab bin Lu’aa. He accepted Islaam in the sixth year after the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent, after nearly forty men and eleven women (had accepted Islaam). The Muslims were overjoyed by that occasion and Islaam spread in Makkah afterward. Abu Bakr entrusted him with the leadership of the Muslim nation, and so he rose to the hardship of the Khilaafah in the best manner. This was until he was killed and died as a martyr in Dhul-Hijjah of the year 23H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Uthmaan</strong> &#8211; He is Abu ‘Abdillaah &#8220;<strong>Dhun-Noorain</strong>&#8221; ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan from the tribe of Umayyah bin ‘Abd-ish-Shams bin ‘Abd Manaaf. He accepted Islaam after the Prophet’s entrance into Daar-ul-Arqam. He was a rich and generous man. He was given the Khilaafah after &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), due to the agreement of the members of the governing body. He remained Khaleefah until he was killed and martyred in Dhul-Hijjah in the year 35H. He was 90 years old at the time of his death, according to one of several opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Alee</strong> &#8211; He is Abul-Hasan ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. The name of Abu Taalib was ‘Abd Manaaf bin ‘Abd-il-Muttallib. He was the first from the youth to accept Islaam. The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) gave him the banner on the Day of Khaibar and Allaah granted victory at his hands. He was given the Khilaafah after the murder of &#8216;Uthmaan. Thus, he became the Khaleefah, governing until he was killed himself, and martyred in the month of Ramadaan in the 40H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best of these four is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan, then ‘Alee. This is based on the report of Ibn ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu): “We used to make preference between the people during the time of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). So we preferred Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, then ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan.” This was reported by Al-Bukhaaree.[2] It is also based on (the hadeeth) in Abu Dawood: “We used to say, while the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was alive: The best of the Prophet’s ummah after him, is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan.” At-Tabaraanee added to this in his report: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it.” I did not find the wording that the author mentions, in which there is the addition of ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most deserving from them of the Khilaafah, after the Prophet, was Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). This is since he was the best of them and foremost to them in accepting Islaam. Also, the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) preferred him to lead the prayer. Furthermore, the Sahaabah agreed upon his superiority and upon giving him the oath of allegiance (bay’ah). And it is not befitting for Allaah to unite them in agreement upon an error. Then ‘Umar, since he was the best of the Sahaabah after Abu Bakr and because Abu Bakr entrusted the Khilaafah to him. Then ‘Uthmaan, due to his merits and due to his election by the Majlis Ash-Shooraa (governing body). They are the ones mentioned in this verse from a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“’Alee, &#8216;Uthmaan, Sa&#8217;ad and Talha.<br />
Zubair and Dhu &#8216;Awf &#8212; members of the governing body.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then comes &#8216;Alee, due to his merits and the consensus of the Muslims of his time upon it. These four are the rightly guided Khaleefahs, whom the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said concerning them: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me. Bite onto it (the Sunnah) with your molar teeth.” And he (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years.” Ahmad, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee reported this hadeeth and Al-Albaanee said that its chain of narration was hasan. Thus, the last part of it, was the Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee. This is as the author has stated and it is as if he places the Khilaafah of Al-Hasan subordinate to his father&#8217;s or just doesn&#8217;t acknowledge it (i.e. Al-Hasan&#8217;s Khilaafah) at all, due to his yielding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) endured for two years, three months and nine nights, from the 13th of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 11H to the 22nd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted ten years, six months and three days, from the 23rd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H to the 26th of Dhul-Hijjah 23H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Uthmaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted twelve years minus 12 days, from the month of Muharram 24H to the 18th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted four years and nine months from the 19th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H to the 19th of Ramadaan 40H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Combined, the Khilaafah of these four (Companions) lasted twenty-nine years, six months and four days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong>Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Alee</strong> (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was given the oath of allegiance on the day that his father, &#8216;Alee died. Then, in the month of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 41H, the command was given to Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and due to that, the signs which the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) spoke of in his statement: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years” and his statement: “Indeed, this son of mine is a Sayyid (noble) and perhaps it will be that Allaah will bring peace between two large parties (i.e. that of Al-Hasan and Mu&#8217;awiyah) through him”[4] came to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Hasan</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen(Commander of the Believers), son of the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born on the 15th of Ramadaan in the third year after Hijrah. He died while in Madeenah and was buried in the graveyard Al-Baqee&#8217; in Rabee-ul-Awwal 50H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Husayn</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the son of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born in Sha&#8217;baan in the fourth year after Hijrah and was killed at Karbala on the tenth of Muharram 61H.</p>

It is also reported on the authority of ‘Imraan bin Husayn (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2561, 3650, 6438 &amp; 6695) and Muslim (no. 2535). Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) also reported it in Muslim (no. 534) as well as others. Furthermore, this is a mutawaatir hadeeth. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr stated the correctness of it being mutawaatir in the introduction to his Al-Isaabah.[2] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 3655). And in another wording found in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3697), it states: “During the lifetime of the Prophet, we used to not put anyone equal to Abu Bakr, then (the same was with) ‘Umar, then (the same was with) ‘Uthmaan. Then we left the (remaining) Companions of the Prophet alone, not distinguishing between any of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Isnaaduhu Saheeh: This is an authentic hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood (4628), At-Tirmidhee (3707) and Ibn Abee ‘Aasim in As-Sunnah (1190). Its chain of narration (isnaad) is authentic as has been stated by Al-Albaanee in his checking to As-Sunnah (2/567). As for the addition that Shaikh Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen has mentioned, which is found in At-Tabaraanee, which is: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it”, then it is an authentic addition, which is established in many paths of narration found in Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (1194, 1195, 1196 &amp; 1197), Ahmad (2/14) and others with authentic chains. Refer to the checking of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim’s As-Sunnah (2/568-569) as well as Fath-ul-Baaree (7/16-17)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poet Abul-Qaasim Ash-Shaabee wrote: &#8220;<em>If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a direct form of <strong>disbelief</strong>. And it indicates that the people have gone far away from the knowledge. So they are not aware of what is permissible and what is not permissible for Allaah alone, as well as what is not permitted for those other than Him. This is due to neglectfulness – and it is from the factors that have made this poet say such a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some <strong>Arab radio broadcasts</strong> have even adopted this saying as a <strong>hymn of Arab nationalism!</strong> This poetry states: &#8220;If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer.&#8221; So this means that Al-Qadar is under the Will of the people! And this is in opposition to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And you will not will until Allaah, Lord of the worlds, has willed”</span> [Surah At-Takweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, guide us with those You have guided. And do not cause our hearts to deviate after having guided us. And grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed, You are the Grantor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story that contains admonition and reflection in it, then it is that which is reported in the biography of &#8216;<strong>Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee</strong> in the &#8220;Thiqaat&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee, who said: &#8220;There used to be a beautiful woman in Makkah who was married. One day she looked at herself in the mirror and said to her husband: &#8216;Do you think there is anyone that can look at this face and not be enticed by it?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So she enquired: &#8216;Who?&#8217; He said: &#8221;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Grant me permission so that I may go entice him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;I give you permission.&#8217; So she went to see him and asked him for a fatwa (religious verdict). So he went with her to a part of Al-Masjid AlHaraam and sat in privacy with her. Then she uncovered her face, so that it looked like half of a moon. So he said to her: &#8216;O slave of Allaah, fear Allaah!'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of Al-Hilyah mentioned this story from &#8220;<strong>Ath-Thiqaat</strong>&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee in his biography of &#8216;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee. <strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> also mentioned it in his book on Hijaab using it as a proof for the niqaab (face-veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of benefit that we can derive from this great noble scholar&#8217;s rebuking of that woman when she uncovered her face in front of him is that: The Taabi&#8217;een used to hold that a woman uncovering herself by unveiling her face in front of male strangers was a serious crime, which needed to be changed and great efforts needed to be made to terminate it. In fact, the matter should be this way, for indeed a person that looks at a woman&#8217;s face and hands, i.e. a woman he is prohibited from looking at, is enjoying the area of the body with the greatest temptation and the most severe in danger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Deceptive Sale, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.</span>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: “What is this O owner of the food?” He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has damaged some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. <strong>So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects</strong>. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally. We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our rizq (sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the <strong>Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj</strong>.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the <strong>angel of death approached Moosaa</strong> in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the <strong>Dajjaal</strong>, the <strong>descent of &#8216;Eesaa</strong> bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of <strong>Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</strong>, the emergence of the <strong>Beast</strong>, the <strong>rising of the sun from the west</strong>, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>punishment and pleasure of the grave</strong> are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.”</span> [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The <strong>Balances</strong> will be set up, the <strong>records</strong> will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.”</span> [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p>The <strong>Balance (Al-Meezaan)</strong> has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.”</span> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the <strong>Fountain (AlHawd)</strong> on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Bridge</strong> is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>will intercede</strong> for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. <strong>Paradise and the Hellfire</strong> are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Death</strong> will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: <span style="color:#008000;">“O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!”</span> [22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that in the same way that backbiting is forbidden for the one who speaks it, it is likewise forbidden for the one who listens to it and approves of it</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory on the one who hears an individual embarking on committing the prohibited form of backbiting, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>to forbid him</strong></span> from doing it as long as he does not fear any open harm resulting from that. But if he does fear (harm) from that, then he is obligated to <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>reject the backbiting with his heart</strong></span> and to <strong><span style="color:#993300;">detach himself</span></strong> from that gathering if he is able to do so. If he has the ability to reject it with his tongue or to cut the backbiting off by changing the topic, then that becomes required of him. And if he does not do that, then he has committed an act of disobedience (i.e. sinned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is forced to stay in that gathering in which backbiting is taking place, and he fears from forbidding it, or he forbids it but it is not accepted from him and he cannot find a way to separate himself from them, then he is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>prohibited from listening</strong></span> and paying attention to the backbiting. Instead, his way out should be by <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>making remembrance of Allaah (dhikr)</strong></span> with both his tongue and heart or just his heart. Or he should <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>think about something else</strong></span> in order to preoccupy himself from having to listen to it. After having done this, his hearing it without listening or paying attention to it will not harm him, while he is in this mentioned state. If he is able, after this, to withdraw from them and they are still backbiting, then separating oneself is an obligation. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when you see those who engage in false conversations about Our verses by mocking at them, then turn away from them until they engage in a different topic of speech. But if the Devil causes you to forget, then after remembering, do not sit in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah AlAn’aam: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that <strong>Ibraaheem bin Adham</strong> was once invited to a waleemah (wedding feast), so he attended it and found people there who were mentioning a man that didn’t come, saying: &#8220;He is truly lazy.&#8221; So Ibraaheem said: &#8220;I brought this upon myself, such that I attended a place in which people are backbiting one another.&#8221; So he left from there and did not eat for three days. What has been recited of poetry with regard to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“And restrain your ears from hearing vile speech<br />
Just as you restrain your tongue from speaking it<br />
Because when you listen to this vile speech<br />
You are a partner to the one saying it, so reflect.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Should One Do When He Hears His Shaikh, Friend Or Someone Else Being Backbitten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is upon the one who hears a Muslim being backbitten to oppose it and prevent the one doing the backbiting. If he is not able to prevent him with his speech, then he should stop him with his hand. If he is neither able to do so with his hand or with his tongue, then he should get up and leave that gathering. And if he hears his teacher (shaikh) being backbitten – or anyone else who has a right over him, or if the person (being backbitten) is from the people of righteousness and nobility, then his concern with what we have mentioned above should be greater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on the <strong>nasheeds (songs)</strong> that are circulating amongst many of the youth and which they call &#8220;<strong>Islaamic nasheeds</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these nasheeds possess Islaamic meanings, and there aren&#8217;t any stringed or <strong>musical instruments</strong> accompanying them, such as the Duff, the drum and its types, then there is no problem with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, an important condition to its permissibility must be clarified. And it is that they must be free of anything that <strong>opposes the Religion</strong>, such as going to extremes and its sorts. Also, there is another condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that it must not be taken as a <strong>(habitual) practice</strong>. This is since it turns those who (constantly) listen to it away from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, which the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet encourages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it turns them away from seeking <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and calling towards Allaah (i.e. da&#8217;wah), the One free of all defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for using the duff with the nasheed, then it is permissible for the women when it occurs (solely) amongst them, apart from the men. And it is permissible during the time of &#8216;Eed and marriage only.</p>
<p>[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p>[62] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Many of the Muslim youth exchange and pass around tapes that have songs (nasheeds) on them, which they call Islaamic. What is the correct opinion on this matter?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If these songs (nasheeds) are void of <strong>stringed and musical instruments</strong>, then generally I say that there is no harm in them on the condition that they are free from things that are in opposition to the Religion, such as asking for help from other than Allaah (<strong>Istighaathah</strong>) and seeking a way of getting close to Allaah (<strong>tawassul</strong>) through the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also it is not permissible to take them as part of the Religion for this would turn the Muslim youth away from reciting the Book of their Lord and reflecting on it. And that is what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, urged us with in many authentic ahaadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Recite the Qur&#8217;aan and chant it (i.e. recite it in a nice melodious manner), before there comes a people that will rush through it and not take their time with it. So chant it (nicely).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever reflects on the condition of the Companions, will find that they did not have the likes of these songs (nasheeds) in their lives, for they were men of realities and not men of entertainment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, may He be Blessed and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-3-38.png?w=484&#038;h=41" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: <strong>&#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.</strong>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says quoting Zakariya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-5.png?w=437&#038;h=37" alt="" width="437" height="37" /><br />
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-6.png?w=484&#038;h=41" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>And verily, I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself a walee (righteous worshipper) who will inherit me and inherit the posterity of Ya&#8217;qoob. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.</strong>”</span> [Surah Maryam: 5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shanqeetee said in Adwaa-ul-Bayaan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s statement in this noble verse: &#8216;So give me from Yourself a walee&#8217; – what is meant by the word walee here is a son specifically and not any other type of walee (righteous person). This is based on proof found in Allaah&#8217;s saying while relating the same story: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: &#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.</span>&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also indicates that what is meant (by the word walee, i.e. righteous person) here is a child by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-21-89.png?w=484&#038;h=41" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord: &#8216;O my Lord, leave me not single! You are the best of the inheritors.&#8221;&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 89] &#8216;Leave me not single&#8217; means: &#8216;Alone and without a child.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of Ash-Shanqeetee&#8217;s words] [Adwaa-ul-Bayaan (3/365)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that from amongst the supplications of the believers – &#8220;those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds, they shall be among the dwellers of Paradise – a promise of truth, which they have been promised” – is that which Allaah has mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-46-15.png?w=466&#038;h=105" alt="" width="466" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly I am one of the Muslims.”</span> [Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 15]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind H. May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of At-Tahaawee in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Abee Zayd Al-Qayrawaanee</strong> said in the introduction to his famous ar-Risaalah, in which he explains the Creed of Ahl-us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best of generations is the one that saw the Messenger of Allaah. And the best of the Companions are the (four) rightly guided Khaleefahs &#8211; Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee, may Allaah be pleased with them all. None of the Companions should be mentioned except in the best of manners. <strong>We believe in refraining from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between them</strong>. And that they are the most deserving of people of having excuses made for them and (that) they are to be thought of in the best way.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee. Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not permissible for anyone to mention any of their faults. Nor can anyone disparage any of them. So whoever does that, then the authority (sultan) is obligated to reprimand him and punish him. And he is not to pardon him, but rather must punish him and then request him to repent. So if he repents, he should accept it from him. And if he doesn&#8217;t repent, he should reinitiate the punishment upon him and lock him in prison for good until he repents and recants (from his false belief).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee</strong> said in his book Aqeedat-us-Salaf wa Ashaab-il- Hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they held it an obligation to refrain from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and to purify the tongues from mentioning anything that consists of a blemish on them or a degradation of them. And they held it an obligation to ask Allaah to grant mercy to all of them and to show friendship to all of them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began</strong>&#8220;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee</strong></span> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, but rather it means that the Ahl-us-Sunnah [21] will go away, up to the point that there will not remain in a land, any from them except one person.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, there can be found in the statements of the Salaf much praise for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah)</strong> </span>used to say to his companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Ahl-us-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another and may Allaah have mercy on you. For indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.&#8221; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is not a thing more stranger than the Sunnah. And what is more stranger than it, is the one who knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Treat the Ahl-us-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.&#8221; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding of the term &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; to these scholars, was the way of the Prophet &#8211; that which he and his companions were upon &#8211; free from <strong>Doubts (Ash-Shubuhaat)</strong> and <strong>Desires (Ash-Shahawaat)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, Al-Fudayl Ibn Tyaad (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah is he who knows what is entering his stomach from the halaal&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the consumption of halaal is from the greatest aspects of the Sunnah, which the Prophet and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it remained the custom of the majority of the later scholars, from the scholars of hadeeth and other fields, that the Sunnah consisted of what was free from Doubts in regards to Creed. This was especially the case with issues such as the belief in Allaah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and other issues such as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Ordainment) and the merits of the Sahaabah. They compiled literary works concerning this knowledge and named them books of &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;. This knowledge was only labeled with the name &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;, because its significance was tremendous and all those who opposed it were on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the complete Sunnah, then it is the path that is free and safe from Doubts and Desires, as has been stated by Al-Hasan, Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd, Sufyaan, Al-Fudayl and others besides them. Due to this, its adherents are described as strange because of their small number and rarity in the Last Days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it has been mentioned in some of the previously stated reports that they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are greater in number than those who obey them.&#8221;</strong> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is an indication of the smallness of their amount in number and in the amount of those who answer and accept their call. We also are made aware of the greatness in number of those who oppose them and disobey them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why it is reported in numerous ahaadeeth, praise for the one who sticks firmly to his Religion during the Last Days. And that he who does so will be like one who holds tightly onto hot pieces of coal. <strong>And that the one who acts upon it, will receive fifty times the reward more than those before him</strong>. [25] This is because he will not find any supporters in doing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>These strangers are of two categories</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them are those <strong>who rectify themselves</strong> when the people have become corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category contains those <strong>who rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah</strong>. And this (latter one) is the most highest and virtuous of the two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] What is meant by the term Ahl-us-Sunnah are all the Muslims who strictly follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. They learn it, act upon it, enforce it and teach it to others. They consist of the scholars, their students and those that follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] This report was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee. Badr Al-Badr indicated its weakness in his notes to Kashf-ul- Kurbah. However, a similar narration to this one has been recorded by Ad-Daarimee (1/72) and its wording is: &#8220;For verily, Ahl-us-Sunnah are the least of people in number who have preceded, and they are the least of people in number who remain.&#8221; This narration is authentic. See Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql&#8217;s book Maflioom Ahl-is- Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] This narration was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in his Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (1/64) and it was mentioned from him by Ibn Al-Jawzee in Talbees Iblees. Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql mentioned it in his book Mafhoom Ahl-is-Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Musnad Ahmad (2/177) and its checking has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] This saying is based on the following hadeeth of the Prophet: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, after you there will come times requiring patience. (In those days) the one who holds fast to that which you are upon will have the reward of fifty amongst you. He will receive the reward of fifty (i.e. the one holding onto the way of the companions in later times)</strong></span>.&#8221; Reported by Al-Marwazee in As-Sunnah (no. 35), At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer (17/117), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (no. 3441), At-Tirmidhee (no. 3057), who declared it saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no. 4014). Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (no. 494)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So they do not elevate them to a level they don&#8217;t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of</strong></span>. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] <strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her own money without the permission of her husband? And what if she knows prior to that, that her husband does not agree with her disposing of her money, even if it is for charity? And also, what about giving away her jewelry which she bought with her own money, without his permission. What is the ruling concerning this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The ruling on this matter is clear from the hadeeth of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her wealth except with the permission of her husband.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, hasan by itself and saheeh based on its various routes of narration. And as for all the reports that it is thought present a contradiction to this hadeeth, then it is not correct to rely on that or claim that they contradict the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth in which the women gave their rings and earrings away in charity, as is reported in the Saheeh, then this has been responded to from many different angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is that it was probable that these charitable donations were given with the permission form the husbands of these women. And it is also possible that this event occurred before this ruling that occurs in the hadeeth became firmly established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So due to this, we advise every Muslim woman that adheres to acting on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah to not give away from her wealth without the permission of her husband. This is because it will be a cause and a reason for the occurrence of disputes between the couple, and the end result of that will be very bad.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the case where a husband is mean and oppressive to his wife (by not granting her permission), she can take her case to the legal jurisdiction. And this is especially the case since today, the legal jurisdictions are in favor of the women. And in a more particular example, in cases like these, all of the judges are in agreement that the woman may freely dispose of her money without the permission of her husband. So if the matter is taken up to the court and the judge rules that this action was a violation on the part of the husband to his wife and he rules that she can give away her money, (she may do so). But if her husband objects and holds that by her doing so, she will be squandering money, at that point the judge can prevent her because, even though he bases it on the rule that it is allowed for her to spend from her wealth, he can not permit her to give away in charity that which is considered excessiveness and a squandering of money. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">If a girl has reached the proper age for getting married, can her guardian force her to get married?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It is not permissible for the guardian of a girl’s affairs to force her into getting married. So if the girl has not reached the proper age and has been forced into marriage, she can look for a way to dissolve this marriage after having reached the age of comprehension and maturity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there was a girl that was forced into marriage during the time of the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. After the marriage, she went to the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! My father has married me to a man that I dislike, in order to raise his own status.&#8221; So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, nullified her marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage, regardless if she is a girl who has reached the legitimate age (of marriage) or she is divorced or she was married and then lost her husband. Rather it is only required of him to direct her towards what is most beneficial for her in her affairs of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no marriage except with (the permission of) a guardian and (the presence of) two trustworthy witnesses.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, also said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not force your women (to get married), but rather get their consent.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Her silence is her consent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are etiquettes and conditions that must be adhered to. However, at times there occurs something that opposes the Divine Legislation, such as when the father prevents his daughter and delays her marriage because of a materialistic ambition. Or because the man proposing marriage to her is poor, and due to this, his status will not be elevated. And so the girl remains without a husband. In this situation, the Divine Legislation has permitted her to marry herself because the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman that marries herself without the permission of her guardian, then her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if they differ, then the authoritative figure (sultaan) is the guardian of one who has no guardian.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this girl – whose father has prevented her marriage due to an obvious materialistic reason – she can take her case to a legitimate judge. So he will investigate the guardian of the girl&#8217;s affairs and interrogate him as to the reason why he is preventing her (from getting married). So if he hears a legitimate reason from him, such as that the man intending marriage is an innovator or he doesn&#8217;t pray or that he drinks alcohol, then the judge cannot oppose him in this. But if he hears illegitimate reasons from him, then at that point, the judge can assume guardianship of her marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[57] <strong>Question</strong>: One of the students of knowledge asked: Many school students ask one another concerning the ruling on leaving one&#8217;s hair to grow and shaving it off. They are confused about this issue because of what the school presses on them from the obligation of shaving all of the head or cutting it very short and because eof what the students see from some practicing teachers who let their hair grow and do not cut it, but they maintain and groom it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So therefore I say [33] – seeking assistance from Allaah – that leaving the hair is Sunnah, as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>It is sunnah. If we were able to manage and control it, we would keep it. But there is discomfort and trouble with (keeping) it (long)</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> And Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>And it was not preserved from him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he used to shave his head except during the sacrificial ceremonies of Hajj (nusuk)</em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are many authentic ahaadeeth that clarify the description of the Prophet&#8217;s sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam hair. It is stated in Al-Mughnee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;<em>It is recommended that a person&#8217;s hair be according to the description of the Prophet&#8217;s hair. If it is long, then it should go to his shoulders and if it is short, then to the earlobes. And if it grows longer than that, then there is no harm in that. This has been reported on Ahmad</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] These are still the words of the questioner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">keeping one&#8217;s hair and leaving it to grow</span></strong> must meet certain requirements, among which are:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There must be <strong>sincerity</strong> to Allaah, the Most High and following of the guidance of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in order to attain reward and merit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There should be <strong>no imitation of women</strong> in his leaving of the hair to grow, such that he does with his hair what the women do with their hair, from the aspects of beautification that is specific to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">He should not desire by it to <strong>imitate the People of the Book or anyone else among the idol worshippers</strong>. Or in imitation of the haircuts and hairstyles of sinful Muslims, such as music and film artists or whoever treads their way, such as the shameless ones among the sports figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">One should <strong>clean it and groom it every other day</strong>. And it is recommended to oil it, perfume it and split it down the middle of the head. And if it grows long, then one can put it in locks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving the hair off</strong></span>, then Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah has written a detailed discussion on this subject and divided it into four types. A summary of what he said is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the shaving of the head is done for <strong>(1) Hajj or &#8216;Umrah</strong> or <strong>(2) for a necessity such as medical treatment</strong>, then this is established and prescribed in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and there is no doubt about it&#8217;s allowance (under these circumstances). As for it being done for any other reason besides those mentioned above, then it falls into being one of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(3) First:</strong> That he shaves it with the intention of making <strong>worship to Allaah (ta&#8217;abbud)</strong>, to practice his Religion (tadayyun) and to abstain from the worldly affairs (zuhd) and not for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. An example of this is such as his making the shaving of the head a trademark of the people of piety and Religion or from the highest level of abstinence and worship. Or that he places those who shave their heads as being better or more practicing or more pious than those who don&#8217;t shave it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is an innovation that neither Allaah nor His Messenger sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam commanded. It is neither obligatory nor recommended according to any of the Imaams of the Religion. Nor was it done by the Companions and those who followed them in righteousness, nor by the scholars who were well known for their piety and their worship, whether from the Companions, the Taabi&#8217;een, those who followed them or those that came after them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(4) Second:</strong> That he shaves his head for a reason other than the sacrifice of Hajj or &#8216;Umrah, and for other than a necessity, and not for trying to please or get closer to Allaah. The scholars have two opinions concerning this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first opinion:</strong> The dislike of it: This is the madh-hab of Maalik and others and it is found in one of the reports on Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: &#8220;They used to dislike that.&#8221; The proof used by those who hold this opinion is that shaving the head is a trademark of the people of innovation, for the Khawaarij used to shave their heads. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Their sign is the shaving of the head.&#8221; Also, some of the Khawaarij consider the shaving of the head as the completion of repentance and religious sacrifices. It is established in the Saheeh that: &#8220;When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was distributing the war booty on the Day of the Conquest, a man with a thick beard and a shaved head came to him…&#8221; And it is stated in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;The one who shaves his head persistently is a devil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second opinion:</strong> Its allowance: This is the most known opinion with the followers of Abu Haneefah and Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee and it is found in a report from Ahmad also. And their proof is what Ahmad, Abu Dawood and An-Nasaa&#8217;ee have reported with an authentic chain, as has been stated by the author of Muntaqaa Al-Akhbaar, on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, that: &#8220;The Prophet sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw a young boy who had shaved part of his head and left the rest of it, so he forbade them from that. And he said to them: &#8216;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.'&#8221; Afterwards, three small children were brought to him and he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, shaved their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he forbade <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-qaz&#8217;</strong></span>, and that is to have some of the head shaved, then this provides evidence for the allowance of shaving all of it. Ash-Shawkaanee said in Nail-ul-Awtaar commenting on the hadeeth that the author of Al-Muntaqaa mentioned: &#8220;In it is proof for the allowance of shaving all of the head. Al-Ghazaalee said: &#8216;There is no harm in it for the one who desires cleanliness.&#8217; And in this is a refutation against those who hold that it is disliked.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is stated in Al-Mughnee: &#8220;Hanbal said: &#8216;My father and I used to shave our heads during the lifetime of Abu &#8216;Abdillaah. So he would see us while we had our heads shaved and he would not forbid us from it.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said: &#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed upon the allowance of shaving the head. And this is sufficient as a proof.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I say,[34] and with Allaah lies the success, this second opinion is what is more established to me due to the authenticity of its reports and their conclusiveness. And Allaah knows best. As for the school&#8217;s executive board preventing the general mass of students from letting their hair grow, then this regulation is only in the way of &#8220;suppressing the means and preventing the evil.&#8221; And this is because of what the school has noted in that a group of students, not small in number, keep their hair long not for the sake of following the Sunnah. But rather, they only do so for the sake of resembling and imitating the famous amongst the shameless celebrities and sports figures, regardless of whether they are Muslims or not. And this is done by them combing their hair in a manner that resembles the hair of these celebrities, expressing their love for them, their amazement with them and with what they are upon. Also, the harm of these students, who blindly follow, is not just limited to themselves and that&#8217;s all. Rather, their influence extends to their school colleagues and so they become affected by this false way, which leads to the wearing down of the students to having weak souls amidst their group. This is especially since they are in this age in which they have constantly changing personalities, numerous desires, and are quick to be influenced and quick to make make decisions. So you will find that the student at this age will receive more influence from his colleagues in school than from the incentives of his teachers or even his parents!! This is what I have to say and Allaah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] These are still the questioner&#8217;s words</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, and may the peace and blessings be upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. To proceed, I strongly support the words that were stated in the last part of the fatwaa for it is traced back to an important legal principle, which is &#8220;Preventing the evil (mafsadah) comes before bringing about the good (maslahah).&#8221; So how can it be when there is no sort of maslahah (beneficial good), but only imitation of the disbelievers or the sinful people? And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;…And whoever imitates a people is one of them.&#8221; There are many other ahaadeeth in various subjects of the Religion that bear this same meaning. I have mentioned about forty ahaadeeth from them in my book &#8220;Hijaab Al-Ma&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah&#8221;, which I have printed recently under the title &#8220;Jilbaab Al-Mar&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, I will always give the ruling that it is not permissible for the male youth and students to let their hair grow long and that they should either shave it off or cut it short, as the general masses of Muslims are doing today, and with Allaah lies the success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is not for anyone to say today that it is disliked to shave the head, for there is no proof for that other than that it was a trademark of the Khawaarij. But today, they – and from among them are the Ibaadiyyah – do not adhere to this practice anymore, from what I know. And if they are found in some land to still be abiding by this practice, then the people of that land should contradict them in that due to what has been stated previously. And if this is not the case, then the fundamental principle is the allowance (to cut), as is stated in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar which has been authenticated in Al-Muntaqaa. And Muslim has also reported it as I have verified in Al-Ahaadeeth As- Saheehah (no. 1123).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head&#8221; then it is a shortened version of the hadeeth of Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, with the wording: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves (his head), tears (his clothes) and wails.&#8221; This is the way a group of the scholars have reported the hadeeth, such as Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (4/411) and the two Shaikhs in their (respective) Saheeh collections. Al-Bukhaaree introduced it in his Saheeh by saying: &#8220;Chapter: What is forbidden from the act of shaving due to a calamity.&#8221; So therefore, the hadeeth is specific for someone who shaves his head as a means of announcing his grief due to the death of one of his relatives. What consists of this person&#8217;s objection of Allaah&#8217;s Divine Ordainment is the Prophet&#8217;s, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, linking it to his words &#8220;tears&#8221;, meaning his clothes and &#8220;wails&#8221; meaning raises his voice in wailing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what supports this is the occasion in which Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported this hadeeth, for he reported it at the time when he was on his deathbed as occurs in the two Saheehs. And it is verified in Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel (no. 771) and in Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz. As for the narration from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas that has been mentioned in the previous fatwaa, then I have not come across its chain of narration and I do not deem that it is authentic. But if it is authentic, then it is likely that it is in reference to imitation of the Khawaarij based on what has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that growing the hair on one&#8217;s head long is Sunnah, then there is no proof for it by which an argument can be established. And it is not sufficient in that regard to say that it is authentically reported on the Prophet (that he had long hair), for that was from his customs (&#8216;aadaat). And it has also been authentically reported on him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he entered Makkah while having four locks (of tied hair), as is mentioned in my book &#8220;Mukhtasar Ash-Shamaa&#8217;il Al-Muhammadiyyah&#8221; (35/23). And &#8220;locks &#8221; means braids and plaits. But this was just an Arab custom, which some of them did not do all the time. So can it be said that this was the Sunnah also? Of course not! So then in customs like this, there must be a specific proof that asserts that it is a Sunnah of worship. But how can this be when the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has placed an equality between the one who shaves his hair and the one who leaves it to grow as is found in his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: &#8220;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.&#8221; Rather, he shaved those three children&#8217;s heads as was mentioned in the fatwaa. And that is an authentic hadeeth also, which I have verified in my book &#8220;Ahkaam Al-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa&#8221; (pg. 166).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not for any of the youth that are being tested with imitation of the disbelievers or of the sinful people in their hairstyles, to use the &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; as a pretext (i.e. excuse), for it is a Sunnah of custom and not a Sunnah of worship. And this is especially since many of these youth do not imitate the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in what is obligatory upon them, such as trimming the moustache and growing the beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, in that there is a reminder for he who has a heart or lends his ear, while he is heedful.&#8221; [Surah Qaaf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfect are You, O Allaah, from all imperfections, and by Your praise, I bear witness that no deity has the right to be worshipped except You. I seek forgiveness in You and repent to You.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning putting limitations to the amount of offspring one has?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The person that limits his offspring without having a legitimate reason for doing so, I hold him to be <strong>foolish</strong> if not a disbeliever in the Qadaa and the Qadar (Divine Execution and Preordainment) of Allaah. This is since the individual that limits his progeny to only three children, for example, and he has reached the age of fifty (!), the thought of death does not even cross his mind, or that some violent storm should come and take the lives of his three children, thus leaving him till the end of his life as if he were barren and without offspring. Therefore, those that put limits to the amount of children they have, they do not reflect upon the things that every Muslim reflects on. And it is Al-Qadar (Preordainment), which befalls the people in the way that He wants, not in the way that they want. So this practice that is done in current times, is a severe negligence and a clear deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the ruling on birth control differ from that of family limitation (of offspring)? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Birth control has some detail to it. Therefore, I say that this thing, which has come to be known as &#8220;birth control&#8221; is from that which the Muslims of today are being tested by in the lands of Islaam. However, there are cases from it, which must be referred back to the motive behind it. An example of this is when the motive for this birth control is based on a prescription from Muslim doctors who are advising the couple towards this so-called &#8220;birth control&#8221; to safeguard the health of the woman who has departed from her natural state due to her having delivered many children! So if a skilled Muslim doctor issues these instructions as a form of advice, then that becomes a legitimate excuse for (the allowance of) this birth control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example in which birth control is permissible. As for an example that is contrary to this one, then it is such as when the motive behind it is due to poverty (!) or because of bills, which is always on the minds of the disbelievers!! So you can see one of them say: &#8220;My wife and I are two. And I have two children!! And the fifth member of them is their dog!! So this monthly pay that we receive is just enough for us (to pay our bills), and that&#8217;s all [five]!&#8221; This is not permissible in Islaam because this motive emanates from the logic of the Days of Ignorance, which we were warned to avoid and stay away from. Such is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide you with sustenance as well as them.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ana’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case since the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muslims believe that the child comes with his sustenance (already) with him</strong></span>. This is because, before it comes out into this world, its sustenance is ordained for it while it is in the womb of its mother, as has been clarified to us in the Noble Sunnah. So this example of birth control, with this motive, is not permissible at all. As for the baseless and false reasons that some people have used to justify and allow it, then they have no place in the Religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the best way for women to give da&#8217;wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say to the women: “<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Remain in your homes</em></span>.” [Surah Ahzaab: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should not concern yourselves with da&#8217;wah. I reject the use of the word &#8220;da&#8217;wah&#8221; amongst the male youth by them making it seem like they are from the people of da&#8217;wah – as if the word da&#8217;wah has become the fashion of modern times. So every individual that knows something about the Religion becomes a Da&#8217;ee (caller to Islaam)! And this matter did not stop with the male youth until it was carried over to the female youth and housewives. And in many instances, they have begun to turn away from fulfilling the obligations of their households and their husbands and their children, turning away from these obligations towards something that is not obligatory upon them, such as establishing the da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general rule concerning the woman is that she is to stay in her home. And it has not been legislated for her to leave it unless she has a dire need. This is based on the statement of the Prophet,sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: &#8220;And (praying in) their homes is better for them&#8221;, i.e. than the (congregational) prayer in the masjid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see a prevalent phenomenon amongst the women in that they go out often to the masjids in order to pray the congregational prayer, not to mention the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. In spite of this, their homes are better for them – unless there is a masjid in which the Imaam is a scholar who teaches those attending some aspects from the sciences of the Religion. So in this case, the woman could go out to pray in the masjid in order to listen to the knowledge. There is nothing preventing her from that. As for the woman preoccupying herself with the da&#8217;wah (!), then let her sit in her home and read from the books that her husband or brother or other male relatives provide for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is nothing preventing her from setting a day in which she calls the women to come to her house or she goes out to attend the house of one of them. That is better than a group of women going out (to her). One woman going out to a group of women is better for them than all of them going out to her. As for her moving about and traveling, perhaps traveling without a mahram, and she justifies that by claiming that she went out for the purpose of da&#8217;wah, then these are from the presentday innovations. And I do not specify the women only with that, rather, even some of the male youth speak excessively about the da&#8217;wah and yet they have very little knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should be said concerning Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;Allaah mocks at them…&#8221; [13] and &#8220;Allaah ridicules them…&#8221;, [Surah At-Tawbah: 79] as well as what is similar to that from the <em>Mutashaabihaat</em> (unclear) verses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf (Predecessors) used to say concerning these ayaat as well as those similar to them: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Leave them as they are stated</strong></span>.&#8221; But they did not mean by this to leave them the way they are without attaching any understanding to them. Rather, they meant by it, to leave them the way they are stated according to their correct understanding, without making comparisons for (the Attributes of Allaah stated in) them (<em><strong>tashbeeh</strong></em>), describing their manner (<em><strong>takyeef</strong></em>), misinterpreting them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong></em>) and denying them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;teel</strong></em>). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All- Seer.&#8221;</span></em> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, there is <em><strong>tanzeeh</strong> </em>(negation of all anthropomorphic qualities from Allaah) as well as <em><strong>ithbaat</strong> </em>(affirmation) for two attributes for Himself, which are hearing and seeing. The understanding of this elimination of all similarities to Allaah (tanzeeh) is that we must (also) affirm the attributes that Allaah has described Himself with or the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has described Him with, as it befits His grandness, may He be Glorified and Exalted. And we do not say &#8220;how&#8221; that is, such as by saying: &#8220;His hearing is like our hearing and His seeing is like our seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we do not misinterpret that (i.e. make ta&#8217;weel) as has been done by some of the extremists from the Mu&#8217;tazilah, such that they have misinterpreted Allaah&#8217;s hearing and seeing to be His knowledge. And this is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s describing Himself with knowledge in many other ayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan! Thus, the misinterpretation (ta&#8217;weel) of these individuals of hearing and seeing for knowledge constitutes ta&#8217;teel (denial of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes). The scholars say about this: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The one who commits ta&#8217;teel worships nothing, while the one who commits tajseem worships a statue</strong></span>.&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say, concerning the two ayahs mentioned previously in the question, which contain Allaah&#8217;s mocking and ridiculing, that it is a mocking and a ridiculing that is befitting for Allaah. And it is not like that which limited intellects may perceive it to be, from that which has comparisons to the<br />
creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Surah Al-Baqarah: 15<br />
[14] Translator&#8217;s Note: This is because the one who commits ta&#8217;teel (mu&#8217;attil) denies all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, so it is as if he is worshipping nothing. On the other hand, the one who commits tajseem (mujassim) ascribes anthropomorphic qualities to Allaah, for example saying His eyes are like our eyes and His hand is like our hands. So it is like He is worshipping a statue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[42] Question: What is the ruling concerning a woman cutting some of her hair?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: With regard to a woman cutting her hair, then one must look into the motive behind her doing it. So if a woman cuts her hair in imitation of the disbelieving or sinful women, then it is not permissible for her to cut it while having this intention. As for cutting only a small portion from her hair or cutting it in accordance to the desires of her husband, then I do not see anything preventing this from being done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim (no. 320) that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet&#8217;s wives used to cut their hair to the point that it would reach the earlobes.&#8221;</span></em></p>

We are women who pray in these masjids, at times following the Imaam from a point where we are not able to see him nor the male followers. And sometimes there is a large empty space left over in the area of prayer for the men. Is our prayer valid if we cannot see the Imaam or any of the (male) followers, and while knowing that sometimes we enter the masjid and don&#8217;t know what rak&#8217;ah he is in. Is it allowed in this situation to follow (the Imaam) by (hearing) the raised voice only? And is it correct for us to follow the Imaam while we are on an upper or lower level knowing that at times there is ample room in the masjid (floor)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The answer is in two parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> is that the prayer and the mentioned scenario is valid so long as the women pray in the masjid, regardless of whether it is in the upper or lower level. And it is so long as they are able to hear the takbeers from the Imaam indicating the change in position, such as from standing to bowing to prostrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second part</strong> is that it is not proper for the women to pray like this unless the area for the men is filled with people and they (the women) cannot find a place behind the rows for them to pray in. In these circumstances, it is permissible for the women to pray in the upper or lower level of the masjid. But if this masjid, where the Imaam and the men behind him pray, has ample room left over, then it is not allowed for the women to go up to the upper level or down to the lower level where they won&#8217;t be able to see the movements of the Imaam or the movements of the men praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">The best rows for the men are their first ones and their worst (rows) are their last ones. And the best rows for women are their last ones and the worst (rows) are their first ones</span></em>&#8220;, he meant by it the same ground that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and his Companions behind him used to pray on. The women were not in upper or lower levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The underlying reason for this is that the speakers at times can be low and at other times they are not working. So the prayer of the women who are following him from an upper or lower level, from which they cannot see the prayer of the Imaam or those behind him, is subject to becoming invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The prayer that is performed while on an upper or lower level is valid. However, it is not permissible to designate those places for prayer when there is enough room in the prayer place (musalla), such that the women are able to pray in the back of it. </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[33] <strong>Question</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does wiping over ones khimaar and turban replace wiping over the ears, due to their both being part of the head? [24]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My opinion, and Allaah knows best, is that at times it does replace it and at other times it doesn&#8217;t. As for the condition in which it does replace wiping (the ears) then it is the state when the turban or the khimaar covers the entire head, including the ears. Thus, in this condition, the hadeeth would apply in that they (ears) are both part of the head literally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other condition in which it is not sufficient to just wipe over the turban or the khimaar, then it is when the turban or the khimaar does not cover the ears. This means that the turban is wide or aloof from the ears. Under these circumstances I hold that the authentic hadeeth about wiping the head itself. This is such that three ways of wiping the head have been established on the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first way:</strong> This is the most common and normal of his ways and it was that he would wipe all of his head directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second way:</strong> If the turban or the khimaar covered the head, then it was sufficient to just wipe over the turban or the khimaar, exactly like the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third and final way:</strong> And this is the area that requires evidence and needs speculation. And it is when the turban would cover the last part of the head, yet expose the front of it (forehead). In this condition, the Prophet sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam would wipe over his head directly and then grasp his turban.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[24] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Prophet said: &#8220;The ears are part of the head.&#8221; [Reported by At-Tirmidhee (37), Abu Dawood (134) and Ibn Maajah (444) and declared saheeh by Shaikh Al-Albaanee in As-Saheehah (1/36)] So we are obligated to wash them when taking wudoo and ghusl even though the ayah concerning wudoo doesn&#8217;t mention the ears but only the head. This question is based on this principle in that if we are permitted to wipe over certain garments in replacement of the head, are the ears included in the same manner?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah fee Naqd ar-Rijaal wal Kutub wat-Tawaa&#8217;if</i>&#8221; (pg. 33-43 of 3rd Edition)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are guidelines, which define those whom we are required to respect and honor from among mankind, such that it is not permissible to harm their honor. And they define those whom it is permissible to speak about and criticize, rather, whom it is obligatory to criticize at the time of necessity and benefit, without having to mention their good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom we are obligated to honor</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The Messengers and Prophets, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon all of them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has related to us their stories, showing their striving and perseverance, while He has repudiated those who denied and opposed them. And He commanded the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) as well as his ummah to follow their example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: The Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing that the Muslim ummah should feel towards them except love and respect. Allaah has praised them highly in His Book. And He spoke about their high rank, their efforts and the sacrifices they made with their wealth and their lives in the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) praised them highly, both on an individual and a group level. This is such that the scholars of Islaam devoted special and close attention to their merits and qualities, writing many books concerning their virtues and special characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from insulting them, saying: <b>&#8220;Do not revile my Companions. For I swear by the One in whose hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give in charity the likes of mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal a mudd (handful using 2 hands) of one of them nor even half of it.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah are well aware of their position and status, and so they guard it with the strictest form of guarding. And they forbid others from speaking vainly about what occurred of dispute between &#8216;Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and those who supported them from the rest of the Companions. Rather, they assert for them the reward that is given to the <i>mujtahids</i>. And they ruled that all those who spoke about them – or even about one of them – were upon deviance, misguidance and heresy.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: Those who followed them in goodness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes those who reached the (time of the) Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and were guided by their guidance, such as the seven scholars of Fiqh of Madeenah and those who followed their way in the rest of the towns. Then after them, are the scholars of Hadeeth, Fiqh and Tafseer – those who strove upon the way of the righteous Companions and Successors. And it includes those who followed their methodology with regard to Creed, holding tightly onto the Book and the Sunnah, avoiding innovations, vain desires and its adherents, and defending the truth and its adherents, up until this day of ours and after it, until Allaah&#8217;s promise comes about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was referring to when he said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah, triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until the order (promise) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, comes.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are better known as Ahl-ul-hadeeth, as has been agreed upon by the Imaams of Islaam and the scholars of guidance. And no one opposes them in regard to what they have agreed on except those from the people of vain desires, ignorance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Al-Haakim and Ibn Al-Qayyim have indeed accused those who criticize them of being heretics. And those who spoke vilely about them (the scholars) have been repudiated severely by Ibn Qutaybah, Ar-Raamaharzamee, Al-Khateeb (Al-Baghdaadee) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that no one speaks against them except for those whom Allaah has led astray and blinded. So if one of these (scholars) errs in an issue from the issues in which Ijtihaad is allowed, it must be clarified but not in the manner of condemning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said with regard to these (scholars):<br />
“So whoever is known to have (the ability to perform) the allowable Ijtihaad, then it is not permissible for him to be mentioned in a manner of condemnation or blame, because Allaah has forgiven him of his error. Instead, it is an obligation due to what he possesses of Eemaan and Taqwaa to show loyalty and love to him, and to fulfill what Allaah has mandated from his rights, such as praising him, making du’aa (supplication) for him, and so on.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom it is permissible to criticize, disparage and warn the people against their harm:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The People of Innovation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible – rather obligatory – to speak about the people of innovation and warn against them and their fabrications, whether individually or as groups and whether they are absent or present. They include those among the Khawaarij, the Rawaafid, the Jahmiyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Karaamiyyah and the people of Rhetoric – those whose knowledge of <i>Kalaam</i> (rhetoric) has brought them to corrupted and deviant beliefs,[3] such as the rejection of all or some of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation to warn against these types of people, their books and their misguided ways. And how great in number they are!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the same applies to those who follow their methodology from the sects [and groups] of our time, such as those who separate themselves away from the people of Tawheed and Sunnah, oppose them and remain far away from their aspects of the methodology. In fact, they wage war against these aspects of the methodology and chase others away from it and its adherents (i.e. the scholars). The likes of these individuals are followed by those who support and defend them. And these followers of theirs mention their good qualities and praise them for it, praising their personalities and leaders. And they have preferred their (innovated) methodologies over the methodology of the people of Tawheed, the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: Reporters of Hadeeth and Witnesses, if they are deemed Unreliable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to criticize these people according to the consensus of the Muslims. Rather, it is an obligation. This has been mentioned and related by An-Nawawee and Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So if the scholars of the science of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel all agree upon criticizing a narrator, accusing him of lying or making gross mistakes. Or they say: &#8220;His hadeeth are to be rejected&#8221;, &#8220;He has baseless (weak) hadeeth&#8221; or what resembles that, then it is permitted for everyone doing research or quoting to quote or report that. And it is not required of him – in the least – to mention that person&#8217;s good qualities, not to mention doing research on all of his good qualities and then mentioning them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. As for the narrators of which there is differing as to whether or not they are reliable or unreliable, or the narrators who were innovators, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Type:</b> To list the mention of that narrator&#8217;s criticism first and accept it without considering the sayings of those who declared him reliable would be abandoning something from the Religion and from what has been established on the leader of the Messengers (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And this is a great injustice and a negligence of something that is part of the Religion, which we are obligated to preserve. And it is a trust that falls on the neck of the scholars (i.e. it is their duty). So in this case, for the benefit of the Religion and for preserving it, and for the sake of giving a general benefit to the Muslims, we must seek to verify the reality of the matter. And we must weigh between the sayings of the scholars of Jarh wa-Ta’deel, taking that which is more established, whether it is from the criticism (<i>jarh</i>) or the approval (ta&#8217;deel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is for the purpose of bringing about this beneficial good, not because it is an obligation to make a balance for the condition of that individual who has been declared unreliable (between his good and bad qualities)! So if it is established that he is in fact unreliable after having done the research, it is permitted to relate his unreliability without mentioning this balancing (between those who criticized him and those who approved of him). And no scholar said that (mentioning) this (balancing) was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the innovator, then if we are in the position of warning against the innovations, then we warn against him, mentioning his innovation only. And it is not an obligation on us to mention any of his good qualities. And if we are in the subject of narrating reports, then it is an obligation to mention his trustworthiness and honesty, if he was in fact trustworthy and honest, for the purpose of benefiting, attaining and preserving the narration. Not for any other purpose, such as the obligation of making a balance (<i>muwaazanah</i>) between his good and bad qualities, as some people claim! So it is not required on us to mention his generosity or his knowledge or his courage or his efforts and good manners, as well as all those other things that have no relation to the subject of narrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were some among the Salaf who would reject the reports of the people of innovation and those who were accused (of weakness, lying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There was once a time in which when a man would say: &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said…&#8217; our eyes would hasten to him and our ears would open wide (to listen) to him. But when the difficulties and disgrace befell the people, we did not take from the people except, for that which we knew.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Sireen said: <b>&#8220;The people never used to ask about the isnaad (chain of narration). But when the fitnah (afflictions) occurred, they began to say: &#8216;Name your men to us.&#8217; So the Ahl-us-Sunnah would be looked upon and their hadeeth would be accepted. And the people of innovation would be looked upon and their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Ibn Sireen indicate that this was the general view of the Salaf at the time, during the days of the last of the Companions and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een) after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this existed in them due to their awareness of being in no need of the narrations of innovators. So they took this firm and solid stance against them. But when those who came after them were obliged to take the reports of the truthful ones among the innovators, they accepted it from them, only under certain conditions and stipulations, which consisted of taking the sound from it, while rejecting the crooked and corrupt aspects from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem Ibn Ya&#8217;qoob Al-Jawzjaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Among them was he who deviated from the truth, yet still possessed an honest tongue. And his hadeeth would be widespread amongst the people since he was forsaken for his innovation but trusted with his narration. So concerning these individuals, I see no other alternative but to take from their hadeeth that which is (already) known, so long as his innovation does not become strengthened because of that.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Third: Those whom it is permissible to backbite:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Chapter: What is permissible from backbiting:<br />
Know that backbiting is permissible for a legitimate and legislated reason, of which the allowance for doing it (the backbiting) would not be possible without it. And they are six reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: Oppression</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Seeking help for changing an evil and returning a sinner to what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: When seeking a legal ruling</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth: Warning and advising the Muslims against an evil. This is in several perspectives, one of which is: Criticizing those who have been declared unreliable in narration and testimony. This is permissible according to the unanimous agreement of the Muslims. Rather it becomes obligatory for necessity&#8217;s sake…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is up to the point where he said:<br />
&#8220;One last case is when one sees a student frequenting an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and he fear that the student may be affected by that. Then it is upon him to advise him of the condition of that innovator, providing that his intention only be for the sake of advising…&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His complete words will be mentioned later in its due place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say: So you see that he did not make it a condition for one to mention the good qualities of the person who is being warned against. And he did not say that it was an obligation to make a balance (between good and bad qualities) as those people make it an obligation, holding that if one abandons doing this balancing then it goes against the trust and it shuns equity and justice!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Someone once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: ‘It is becoming difficult upon me to say, This person is such and such, and that person is such and such (i.e. criticizing them).&#8217; So he (Ahmad) said: &#8216;If you were to remain silent and I were to remain silent, then when will the ignorant person know the authentic from the weak?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And since advising is obligatory with regard to (bringing) beneficial good in the Religion, specific and general:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as is the case when reporters of Hadeeth have made mistakes or lied, as Yahyaa Ibn Sa&#8217;eed said: “I asked Maalik, Ath-Thawree, Laith Ibn Sa&#8217;ad – I think – and Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee about a man that was accused with regard to hadeeth, so they all said: ‘Convey (expose) his affair.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as is the case when the leaders of innovation from those who voiced sayings contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and who performed worship contrary to that of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Then indeed, clarifying their condition and warning the ummah against them is an obligation based on the unanimous agreement of the Muslims.</b> This is such that it was once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: “Is a man that fasts, prays and makes &#8216;Itikaaf more beloved to you or one that speaks out against the people of innovation?” So he (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: “If he fasts, prays and performs &#8216;Itikaaf then that is only for himself, but if he speaks out against the innovators then indeed this is for all of the Muslims. And this is better.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam, Ibn Taimiyyah, said:<br />
“So he has explained that the benefit of (doing) this is general for all of the Muslims with regard to their Religion. And it is from the types of Jihaad that is done in the Way of Allaah. This is since cleansing Allaah&#8217;s way, His Religion, methodologies and legislation, and repelling the transgression of these individuals and having enmity against them is a collective obligation (<i>fard kifaayah</i>), according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the harm of these individuals, the Religion would have indeed been corrupted. And the corruption experienced from these individuals is greater than the corruption experienced from being conquered by the enemies (of Islaam) during war.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, when these (enemies) conquered (the Muslim lands), they did not corrupt the hearts (of the Muslims) and what they contained from Religion, except for what came afterward. But as for these individuals, then they corrupt the hearts from the very start.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has lengthier words on this subject, which will be mentioned later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the true methodology of the Salaf, not just a claim. And it is that methodology, which was followed by Ibn Taimiyyah and others from the sincere and honest Mujaahideen. And no criticism of a critic ever rebuked them, because they did this for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where is it that making this kind of balancing (between good and bad qualities) must be a condition?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And where is the obligation for mentioning a person’s good qualities (when criticizing him), which we hear so often repeated unjustly in defense of those callers to misguidance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather you have seen that Ibn Taimiyyah held that it was an obligation to refute the people of vain desires. And that it was from the different types of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah, since it is a way of cleansing His Religion, methodologies and legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sayings of the Imaams concerning the People of Innovation and (Hadeeth) Narrators:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars of Islaam have indeed spoken out against the people of innovation and the (weak) reporters. And they did not indicate in the least towards the obligation of making it a condition to create this type of balancing (between good and bad qualities). They authored books on the subject of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and books in support of the Sunnah and in refutation of the people of innovation and in criticizing them. And they wrote books on the defects (of hadeeth) and books on the fabricated ahaadeeth. They did not make it an obligation to make this type of balancing (<i>Muwaazanah</i>) at all. In fact, they even wrote books specifically with just Jarh (discrediting of reporters) in them, and limiting them to mentioning only those (narrators) that were declared unreliable or those who were spoken about with criticism. So they did not place this principle (of<i>Muwaazanah</i>) as a condition at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Imaam Al-Bukhaaree – who was who he was with regard to possessing authority, religious characteristics, good manners and piety – wrote two books on weak narrators and he named them &#8220;<i>Al-Kabeer</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>As-Sagheer</i>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And An-Nasaa&#8217;ee wrote a book about the weak and rejected narrators called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa wal-Matrookeen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-&#8216;Aqeelee wrote a book on weak narrators, which is known as <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Adiyy authored a book, <i>al-Kaamil</i>, about those who were criticized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan wrote a book specifically about those who were declared unreliable called <i>al-Majrooheen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Daaraqutnee and Ibn Ma&#8217;een have numerous books in which they answer questions concerning weak narrators and rejected reporters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim wrote a book called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i> (Weak Narrators), which is a chapter from his (bigger book) <i>al-Madkhal</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nu&#8217;aim and Ibn Al-Jawzee wrote on this subject also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee wrote three books on those who were declared unreliable and those who were criticized, which are <i>al-Meezaan, al-Mughnee and Deewaan ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr authored <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the books on al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel are filled with the discrediting of those who were declared unreliable (<i>majrooheen</i>), especially the books of Imaam Yahyaa Ibn Ma&#8217;een. So they did not make it a condition that this <i>Muwaaznah</i> (mentioning good and bad qualities) must be employed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Indeed, this methodology, which makes this <i>Muwaaznah</i> a condition, is indeed from that which results in: The discrediting returning back to the (past) scholars of Islaam, and their falling into the web of being accused with injustice and treachery (i.e. since they did not mention the good deeds of those whom they criticized). We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from a methodology that produces such kinds of consequences.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, it is appropriate to mention some examples of the criticism of the Imaams (scholars) on some people, in which they just mentioned the criticism without showing any consideration to what they had from good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Marwadhee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Abu &#8216;Abdillaah (Ahmad Ibn Hanbal) once mentioned Haarith al-Muhaasibee and said: &#8216;Haarith is the source of all this affliction – meaning the innovations of the views of Jahm. There is no calamity except for Haarith.'&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Habeeb Ibn Abee Hilaal: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;He is rejected.&#8221; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Habeeb Ibn Jahdar: Ahmad declared him a liar. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Al-Hasan Ibn Dhakwaan: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;His ahaadeeth are forged&#8221; and in one report, he said: &#8220;He is of no significance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Khaalid Ibn Yazeed Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan Al-Hamdaanee: Ahmad said: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He said: &#8220;Jisr bin Farqad: Yahyaa Ibn ad-Darees and others reported about him that: &#8216;He is of no significance.'&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Khaalid bin Iyaas al-Qurshee al-&#8216;Adawee al-Madanee: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Dawood Ibn al-Muhbir: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected.&#8221; [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Dawood Ibn &#8216;Ataa Abu Sulaimaan al-Madanee: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. Ahmad said: &#8216;I saw him and he was nothing.'&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Ibraaheem Ibn &#8216;Uthmaan Abu Shyibah: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected and he was from Koofah.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibraaheem Ibn Al-Hakam Ibn Abaan: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from &#8216;Adan.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ibraaheem Ibn Khatheem: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from Baghdaad.&#8221; [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Ibraaheem Ibn Yazeed Al-Khoozee: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from &#8216;Adan.&#8221; [21]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it&#8217;s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well &#8211; such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every time someone takes care of his books &#8211; whether by binding them or preserving them so that they can last longer in the future &#8211; the result of this is that his reward and recompense will be greater for doing that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the amazing stories about negligence shown towards books is what was reported by Al-Qiftee, author of the book<i> Inbaa&#8217;-ur-Ruwaat</i>, concerning the story about him and the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee. Perhaps I mentioned it to you before. Al-Qiftee was very enthusiastic for books so much so that he had gathered a collection of books that was from the best of what could be compiled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-San&#8217;aanee in the author&#8217;s own handwriting was presented to me, and it consisted of the second, third and fourth volumes, however, the first volume in the author&#8217;s handwriting was missing.&#8221; Even though there was a span of close to 250 years between the time of Al-Qiftee and that of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, he nevertheless purchased the three volumes and said: &#8220;So I bought them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then some time had passed during which he would continuously ask people about this book trying to find the first volume. He kept asking about it and getting nothing in reply to the point that he thought the book was missing and that that was the end of it. Perhaps the book written in the author&#8217;s handwriting had been borrowed by someone and then went missing or it had gotten lost, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on to say: &#8220;Then one day, my servant brought me a parcel of legumes &#8211; i.e. a kind of vegetable &#8211; wrapped up in pieces of paper that appeared to be originally from a book. So I grabbed the paper before the legumes&#8221; &#8211; since they had no value to him compared to these pieces of paper &#8211; &#8220;and when I looked at it, behold it was the handwriting of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, which I recognized! I then took it to my copy of the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> and discovered that this page was from the first volume that was missing! So I rushed in haste to the one who was selling the legumes and found that only a few pages from it were still left. So I asked him: &#8216;Where are the rest of these papers?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;We wrapped legumes with it and they are dispersed throughout the people&#8217;s homes.'&#8221; So he said: &#8220;Verily, to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone&#8217;s loss is another person&#8217;s gain! This one is sad because of his loss, while the other is happy because he found these pieces of paper which contain the handwriting of Al-Haafidh As-Sam&#8217;aanee that have no value to him and which he instead used to wrap legumes in and give out to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said that he, i.e. Al-Qiftee, then spent a month mourning over knowledge and its people and for the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wanted to say by relaying this story that one must take special care of his books &#8211; whether by way of reinforcing them or by way of preserving them. If one has the pages of a book all over the place then it is easy that the pages will get lost. But if they are preserved and attached to each other, this is the best way to guarantee that they will continue to exist in your library.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issues related to this subject are many. Perhaps what we mentioned here will serve as a reminder for some of the things that are required with regard to books. I ask Allaah to grant myself and you success, correctness, uprightness and guidance, and may the peace, praises and blessings of Allaah be on our prophet, Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to caring for books, even though this topic is vast and covers many aspects, is that a student of knowledge should review and examine his books from time to time. This means that he should not amass books without reviewing what he has. So, for example, he goes out and gets this book and that book, puts them in his library and only refers to a small portion from them. One should continuously inspect all of his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should go and examine what books you have so that you remember the subjects they cover. This is since some people buy the same book twice or three times or maybe even four times due to the fact that they have forgotten that they already have the book! And this is because of the few times that they inspect and review their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if one were to have a constant connection to his books &#8211; especially in countries such as ours where the libraries of some of the students of knowledge are big &#8211; if he does not review his books, perhaps he will ask to borrow the book from someone when he already has it himself! Or perhaps he may forget what is in the book or need to research a topic but because he doesn&#8217;t review his collection, he makes no reference to that book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books is one&#8217;s concern for donated books. Donated books refer to any book that has an imprint or seal on it that states that it is a donation (i.e.<i> waqf</i>). You may only keep these books in your library so long as you meet the donor&#8217;s conditions. When a person donates books he is (firstly) making them available for the students of knowledge. If you are not using the book and someone else needs it, then giving the book to someone else that needs it is better. Yes, you may have a valid need for the book, even if it is one time in the year that you refer to it. There is nothing wrong with this since this book was given as a donation for the students of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you do not refer to the book and two years or four to five years have passed by without you looking into it and you acknowledge that you have no interest in referencing this book or these books in general or perhaps you won&#8217;t need the book in the future, then in this case your keeping it contradicts its purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars say that it is not permissible to keep these books (in this situation) and that they should be given to those who deserve them. They should be passed on to those who will use them and benefit from them. This is since the donor has intended them as donations for only those who will use them. If you are not using them then it is more fitting that it should go to someone who will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some students of knowledge that feel that they are above keeping donated books if they have a lot of money and are able to obtain the book by buying it. This is since perhaps one may store away the book and not use it. So if the book is a charitable copy then it may be that he is sinning for withholding this book from someone who can use it. This is perhaps more noticeable in countries in which books are more scarce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A student should arrange his books in such a way that it is easy for him to refer to them if there is an issue that requires him to research some of his books. This means that he should maintain his books in a certain order. The way the books are to be organized depends on the preference of this student. So if he requires that all of his books on Tafseer be arranged together and all of his books on Hadeeth be arranged together, and he further divides the Tafseer section into its various sciences and the Hadeeth section into its various sciences, and the Fiqh books into their respective<i> madh-hab&#8217;s</i> and so on and so forth, then there is no harm in this. And if he decides to arrange his books in some other order that he feels is more beneficial, then there is also no problem with this. The objective is for the book to be in a place where if he looks for it, he will find it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Books are divided into two types: Large books and small treatises. As for the large books, then these are the ones that we see in a library. This is since they are big &#8211; 10 volumes, 15 volumes, 13 volumes, 14 volumes, etc. This is clear. Rather, what deserves special attention are the small treatises, which are also important. It is possible that these smaller books may contain knowledge that cannot be found in the bigger books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he needs to refer to one of these small treatises, he looks for it but can&#8217;t find it. Why? It is because he has not put it in its proper place. One should take special care of these small treatises by putting them in a separate area. This means that they should not be put amidst the works of research and the larger books. So for example, a person may put a large book on his shelf and then next to it place a small book, in terms of its pages, and then next to that a small 40-50 page treatises and so on! The scholars have devoted some of their attention to this aspect, such that they have put forth what they call &#8220;compilations&#8221; consisting of a volume or more in which there can be found 10 or 12 treatises or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it&#8217;s possible, a student of knowledge should compile these small treatises into a collection, placing booklets of a similar subject into one volume. This means that he should put all the small treatises that deal with the manners of seeking knowledge in one specific volume, for example, or the small treatises that deal with the subject of Hadeeth terminology in a separate volume or the essays on the sciences of Tafseer and the sciences of Qur&#8217;aan in one specific collection and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he should place his Fiqh-related books and treatises separately. It is also appropriate to divide the Fiqh-related books and treatises into different sections, within themselves, according to what topics of Fiqh (jurisprudence) they fall under. So for example, one should place a treatise on crimes in its proper place amongst the chapters of Fiqh, thus organizing his books in this manner. He should begin with the treatises that deal with purification, followed by the treatises that deal with prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even those treatises on prayer should be subdivided into those that deal with the conditions of prayer first followed by the rulings on prayer which include the prostration of forgetfulness, for example. Each book should be put in its proper place. They should not be placed in the section of Zakaat, say, which comes after the prayer. The same should then be done with similar treatises, i.e. these small booklets that are hard to locate if one needs to refer to them. They should be organized according to their subjects of jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the rest of the Islamic sciences whether they deal with history, Creed or their likes. One should put the books that cover Creed in general amongst the general books or treatises on Creed. Or he should place those subjects on Creed that he is researching into different sections on Creed so that it is easy for him to refer back to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one&#8217;s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge&#8217;s regard for his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you visit and are granted access to a person&#8217;s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about &#8211; and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward &#8211; or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his book on the judges of Egypt, which is called<i> Raf&#8217;u-il-Isr &#8216;an Qudaat Misr</i>, Al- Haafidh Ibn Hajr records a biography of one of the judges in Egypt and mentioned that when he was granted his judicial position, he would sit in a place where his books were on display. His books would be arranged in a nice and neat order. A student of knowledge entered his office once and saw his books and said: &#8220;What excellent order these books are in!&#8221; He was insinuating that the neat order and arrangement that his books were in indicated his lack of referencing them and using them. The judge understood this and kept it a secret to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, this man that had criticized the judge for having his books neatly arranged was put in charge of recording people&#8217;s marriages, i.e. the marriage contracts &#8211; something like an official that is licensed to wed couples. So the judge discovered that he had made an error in one of his marriage certificates and then rebuked him harshly. This shows that he had preserved that statement he made (a long time ago) in his memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that this student used the fact that the judge&#8217;s books were neatly arranged as proof that he didn&#8217;t read or use them. But this is not always the case. If a student of knowledge wants to work on a subject or research an issue and he takes a number of books out, putting them in front of him and looking into this one and looking into that one, when he finishes, he should return them back to their proper place so that it will be easy for him to refer back to them at a later time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of dealing with books is that a student of knowledge focuses his attention on the revised and accurate editions of books only. In the old days, books used to be bought from a manuscript transcriber known as a<i> warraaq</i>. A person was called a<i> warraaq</i> if he had a place where he would manually transcribe a copy of a book and sell it to buyers or sell it to someone who intended to sell his manuscripts (i.e. dealers). These people were known as <i>warraaqoon</i> &#8211; those who devoted their time to transcribing books by hand or to just selling books. Amongst these transcribers were those who were vary careful in their work and others who weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest things in resemblance to them in our time are the publishing houses and print shops that exist today. They have inherited the work of the <i>warraaqoon</i> throughout the passage of time. This is why we say that the occupation of the copyists was taken over in detail as time passed on by the scholars. A student of knowledge should strive to buy a verified and edited book or to transcribe one by hand whilst comparing what he has copied to the original manuscript. Or he should buy a book and compare it with a reliable source copy that is studied in the presence of scholars and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What this means is that a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring the authentic and verified editions of book whether in manuscript or published form. In this day and age, most of the students of knowledge devote their attention and concern to only the published books. This is why we see that the books in print today are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publication of books in the Arabic Language began a little more than five centuries ago, i.e. printing books in Arabic started more than 500 years ago, which was around 1400-1500 AD, since that is the time they were dated. However, the majority of the books that were printed in the Arabic Language in the Arab and Muslim lands only occurred in the last two-hundred years. Whatever was printed before that was published in the western countries due to their high regard for publishing books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of all this is to show that the publication of books is something old and well established. Today one can find displayed in the marketplaces and stores a variety of different publishing companies, books, and names of verifiers and editors, etc. This is why many times that a phrase or a sentence is quoted from a recently published book, which is not necessarily revised accurately or precisely, the result is that discrepancies and mix-ups occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened to me several times while teaching in the mosque&#8217;s study area. I confirm the reading of a passage (from a book being studied), for example, based on an accurate edition of the book, then one of the students of knowledge comes and presents a recent edition of the same book in which the passage in there is inaccurate. The reason for this is because the contemporary publishing companies are not all precise and meticulous with the books they print. This also can apply to the older publishing companies. So regardless if the book was published a long time ago or recently, you should strive to find which edition of the book is the most accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are interested in purchasing a book or acquiring knowledge on some subject, you must seek to attain the most accurate edition of the book that has been published with precision. So you should ask the people of knowledge or those who have expertise on this subject, saying for example: &#8220;What is the most reliable edition of such and such book?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of <i>Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer At- </i><i>Tabaree</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</i>?&#8221; &#8211; which if you acquire, you will keep in your library and have no need for another edition of the book to go along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we have observed today from many publications is that you find the publishing companies only print books for commercial purposes and so they come out unreliable. This is why you should ask about which edition you should acquire or which edition you want to purchase. So you should not just buy any book that is thrown at you. Rather, you should ask about it and become aware of the publishing company that has produced it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a certain individual has verified and reviewed the publication of the book, you should ask about whether or not this individual is accurate or inaccurate in his verification. Is he a businessman or not? And so on and so forth. To reiterate, a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring only the most accurate edition of a particular book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should only buy a book after enquiring about it. For example, you should ask: &#8220;Which is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; So if you receive an answer to this question, you should then go and strive to acquire this edition of the book regardless of whether it is printed or photocopied or published in modern times via computer formatting. You should strive to acquire only the correct and accurate editions of books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have noticed according to my opinion is that most of the books that the brothers have in their hands are editions that are not accurate and precise. They may have a valid copy of the book however it is not completely accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some individual has taken charge of the overview of its publication but what he has done can hardly be called &#8220;taking charge.&#8221; Or it is said that the edition was amended by the publishing house and so on and so forth, however, it contains mistakes and errors the likes of which make the edition defective and not fit for a student of knowledge to acquire and reference and use for researching information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the second etiquette is that a student of knowledge should strive to acquire the accurate and precise editions regardless of whether they are printed in older form or they are recent publications. What is important is that the edition is accurate. So one should get to know and become acquainted with which publishing companies are meticulous and precise and which publishing companies are not. This is so that he will be able to know and distinguish which editors are just interested in business from which ones show great concern and care for their verifications. By doing this, he will also be able to tell the advantages that certain editions have over others, as well as how many times one book has been published.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will diverge from the topic a little here and say that a student of knowledge should also be careful when looking into verifications and what people do nowadays such as placing footnotes and comments in their books. He should be aware of the different editions that exist for a book because it may be for example that an editor makes a reference to a volume and page number of a particular book and the reader believes that the book was only printed once. So when he goes to reference the volume and page number of the edition that he has, he cannot find it and says: &#8220;This person has erred or made a mistake.&#8221; It is possible that this same book was published over a hundred times or twenty times of thirty times or five times or four times and so on and so forth. So if a student of knowledge is aware of the different editions of the book and the number of times it was printed and the advantages and merits that some editions have over others, this is from the supplementary forms of knowledge that is from the general etiquettes that a student of knowledge should abide by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third etiquette with regard to books is that one must strive to keep his books clean and preserved. This means that his books should be clean and have no dust attached to them. They should not be dirty nor should they have any bad markings on them. They should also not be put in an improper place, meaning the book should be put in an appropriate place that is befitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is not befitting for books &#8211; especially the books of the people of knowledge in which can be found a clarification of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; is that they have dirt, dust and filth on them. Keeping books clean is a sign of one&#8217;s respect for what is contained in them and a proof that one magnifies the symbols of Allaah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِبﻮُﻠُﻘْﻟا ىَﻮْﻘَﺗ ﻦِﻣ ﺎَﻬﱠﻧِﺈَﻓ ِﻪﱠﻠﻟا َﺮِﺋﺎَﻌَﺷ ْﻢﱢﻈَﻌُﻳ ﻦَﻣَو<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever magnifies the symbols of Allaah, then that is truly from the piety of the hearts.&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Hajj: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the book is on Tafseer or on the Sunnah or on Fiqh &#8211; the lawful and unlawful &#8211; or on Creed, then a person should strive to preserve them. Maintaining books clean falls under honoring Allaah and honoring the religious knowledge that is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When dealing with books, from the perspective of preserving and safeguarding them, a student of knowledge should also be careful of not turning his book into a parcel for his documents, special essays or receipts, i.e. such as the sales receipts for the books he bought and so on. If you were to pick up one of his books and look at it you would find that there is a receipt and a treatise inside it or that there is a pen and an eraser inside it and so on an so forth. Some of the scholars have said: &#8220;Do not turn your book into a bouquet or a parcel.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books &#8211; that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book&#8217;s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace be upon him). So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also not proper to put a glass of water or a cup of tea or their likes on top of books. The books of the people of knowledge, which contain texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah should be put in the highest places and not in the lowest places with pieces of paper and such on top of them. Abiding by this etiquette instills respect in the heart for the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah, not to mention the knowledge that is derived from these two sources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also related to preserving books is when a student of knowledge is careful in the manner that he records text from books. Sometimes, we see books with written comments in them that are annotated in such a way that their benefit is squandered. In what has preceded, we have seen that the scholars forbade from writing small letters in books, such as when you write notes using tiny lettering or when you make notes on points of benefit found in your book using such small letters that if a student of knowledge wanted to, he would not be able to benefit from them. In what has been reported, Imaam Ahmad one time regretted having recorded<i> ahaadeeth</i> with small handwriting. This is since when he needed to refer to them in his old age, he was not able to extract these points of benefit because they were written in very tiny letters and the ink from the letters were so close to each other that it was hard to read and thus the benefit was lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars or students of knowledge may not have good handwriting. This is not a flaw. However, one should arrange his letters in such a way that they are written clearly. This is since some of the scholars who didn&#8217;t possess good handwriting would not be able to read even their own handwriting, as was the case with Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah whose writings would have to be extracted by one of his students. This is mentioned in the books on Biographies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer indicated this in the 14th volume of his collection<i> al- </i><i>Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</i> while discussing the year in which this student of Ibn Taimiyyah passed away. He said: &#8220;And he was the one who would be able to extract the second sermon of Ibn Taimiyyah. And whenever Ibn Taimiyyah would want to take a portion (from his writings), no one would be able to extract it except for him since Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taimiyyah) would write in a hurry and his writings would be unclear, so at times it would appear obscure to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to the letters being written very small. This could work, however it is not possible all the time, which is why a student of knowledge needs to know how to write in his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth have advised in their etiquettes on writing that when a student of knowledge wants to write, he should start from the line that he is in or in which can be found the note, then continue by going up towards the top and not the bottom. This means that when you study a book with a teacher or you make notes in a book and you come upon an area where you begin writing (a comment), you should transfer from that line to a line above it. The reason for this is because you may encounter a point of benefit in the line that follows that one, which requires you to write a note for it, and so then you will be confused on how to write it. Start ascending to the line above it. If you write from the bottom to the top, this will ensure that your writing will be clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also try to make your lines straight but designed in a sloping manner such that if you want to correct anything later, you can insert that correction in the empty spaces that are between the slants. Perhaps some of you have seen some of the old books with notes in them and noticed that these (notes) were written in blocks of text that appear to be in the shape of triangles. This was not done in vain and without purpose. Rather, these books were written this way &#8211; in the manner of the ancestors &#8211; because they needed to be verified afterward. The corrections would be placed in the empty spaces (on the sides of the triangle) or the book would be compared to another manuscript and notes from that manuscript would be annotated in these empty spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, you must give great importance to having handwriting that is clear and organized in terms of knowing the place where the writing starts. So if I were to look at what you wrote and the notes you made, I would know where the note you made for this sentence begins and in which direction it will go.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, if you reference the books on terminology, their authors have explained how to write and make notes in books using guidelines and details that they have established on either preserving the text, explaining a word, making a correction, writing a footnote, clarifying which manuscript it is or how to write valid phrases and so on. So we should refer to these books on terminology because their authors wrote about this and talked about it in detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books which deserves attention is: A student of knowledge should maintain (a list of) selected points of benefit for each of his books. This means that if someone reads a book and he doesn&#8217;t feel that he will remember or be able to recall what he read later &#8211; even if he is young &#8211; he should select points of benefit from this book and write them down in a special notebook. Or he can make references to them in the preface of the book, such as in a page at the beginning of the book. So he makes something that resembles a table of contents, however, it is specifically catered to him since these points of benefit that apply to him may not apply to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are specifically for you when you need to reference something you learned from this book at a later time. Two nights ago, I took the book<i> al-Fadl-ul- </i><i>Mubeen fee Sharh al-Arba&#8217;een</i> of Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee from its place in my library. It had been almost ten years since I last read the book, but when I opened it up to its first page, lo and behold, I found the points of benefit in the book that I had written down a long time ago. And there were many, many points of benefit of which I had forgotten almost ninety percent of them. So instead of reading the book over again, all I had to do was look at this point of benefit and that point of benefit and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the points of benefit found in the book, for example, was the author&#8217;s discussion on the difference between the<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> and the<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and the reason why the Sufis renounced the word<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> in favor of using the word<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and why they say the &#8216;Aarif so and so and not the &#8220;&#8216;Aalim&#8221; (i.e. scholar) so and so. This is one of the points of benefit found in this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit in the book was an excellent and firm quote from Ibn Hazm found in his book<i> al-Fisal</i> on the meanings of the (verbs)<i> qadaa</i> (to divinely ordain) and<i> qaddara</i> (to divinely pre-decree). At the end of the quote, Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee says: &#8220;And this is the most brilliant of what was said concerning the meaning of<i> qadaa</i> and<i> qaddara</i> and what has the most right to be accepted.&#8221; And it is just as he said. Perhaps I will relate that to you at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These points of benefit that you record at the beginning of the book are very important. If you refer to the book some time after reading it, you will find these points before you. This means that when you read a book or a group of books, you should select points from them, which you feel are beneficial and useful to you and annotate them at the beginning of the book in the first page. So it will take the form of an index with brief phrases describing the point of benefit (and the page number where it can be found).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is extremely important for a student of knowledge. If you are able to make a special notebook in which you can place selected points that you may need, then this is important and you will definitely refer to it later on in time. It is not proper for you to read a book just like this and say that this (one-time) reading is sufficient because after one or two months or maybe after a year, you will forget what you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if you write down (the most important points of) what you read, you can refer back to it years later and find that the points of benefit are available for display before you, as the saying goes: &#8220;Understanding is contingent &#8211; it comes and goes, whereas writing is recorded.&#8221; Write down what you have understood or record what you have learned from the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From the etiquettes related to books, also, is: The manners of lending out books. Giving out books for people to borrow is not allowed unless you are giving them to someone that you trust will care for the books. The reason for this is because you have the most right to your book, unless you find someone else that is in need of it and who, when finished using it, will return it back to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the biography of Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee that a man once asked him if he could borrow one of his books, so he replied saying: &#8220;You have three days to use it.&#8221; The man said: &#8220;That is not enough time.&#8221; So Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;I have counted its pages, so if you want to make a copy of it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to read it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to do more than that with it, then I have the most right to my book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is correct, since in the past I had lent the first volume of a large book consisting of eight volumes to a brother &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to mention the title of the book, since perhaps he may hear this and think that I&#8217;m insinuating him &#8211; and now nearly twelve years have passed on, and he still has not returned it to me! And he tells me he doesn&#8217;t know where he put it. Similarly, the eighth volume of another set &#8211; even though I&#8217;m not worried so much over it &#8211; however, more than twenty years have passed and until now, he has not given it back. This is why a poet once said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Do not lend your books<br />
</i><i style="line-height:1.5em;">And make your answer some excuse<br />
</i><i>Whoever does in fact lend a book,<br />
</i><i>I swear he has not done something good.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another person said: &#8220;The perdition of books is in lending them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to a man from India who had opened up a huge library: &#8220;How did you create this library?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;By borrowing books from people.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;How is that?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;I borrow a book and don&#8217;t return it. This is how I was able to create this library.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a crime against those you borrow from?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Whoever lends his books to people is insane. And whoever gives back what he borrows is even more insane than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since souls are attached to books. In his book<i> al-Qawaa&#8217;id</i>, while speaking about a principle, Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab mentioned that there is no capital punishment of cutting off the hand for stealing them &#8211; i.e. if a person steals a book, then according to some scholars, he does not have to have his hand cut off. This is since there is a doubt in this &#8211; i.e. that the truth contained in books is (free) for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, one of your fellow students or colleagues may get a book and then believe that he has a right to it, especially if the book is a charitable copy or it was given to you as a gift or so on. So this would cause him to take the issue of returning it lightly. He will be lax in giving the book back. And you will be the one who loses out on the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if you are not sure if the one who is asking to borrow a book from you is serious and will benefit from it in a short amount of days and nights, then do not lend him the book. This is since when you lend your books out to people, you are depriving yourself from their benefit. And not every one that borrows a book can be trusted with it, for how many people have borrowed books and not returned them!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a man sells something that he doesn’t own</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, a man goes to a businessman looking for a specific product, but this businessman doesn’t have this specific product. Yet they both agree to a contract (for the sale of the product) and agree on the extent of the price (on the item) presently or in the future. And all the while, the product is not found in the possession of the businessman or the buyer. Then the businessman goes and buys this product and hands it over to the buyer after they already agreed to a price and they made a contract and determined the value as it relates to present terms or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of business transaction is haraam. Why? Because he sold something he didn’t own and he sold something before gaining possession of it, if the product was specified. As for if the product was not specified and its price was delayed, he actually sold a debt on credit. The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from doing that, as was the case when Hakeem bin Hazaam (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) came to him, saying: “O Messenger of Allaah, what if a man comes to me wanting to buy something from me, but I don’t have it. Then I go to the marketplace and buy it for him?” The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Do not sell what you don’t have.” </strong>This is a clear cut forbiddance, therefore it is not permissible for a person to sell some specified commodity unless he is in possession of it before making a contract on it, whether he will sell it right there or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to take this matter lightly. So whoever wants to sell something to the people, then he should store the products in his store or in his shop or in a warehouse or in the trunk of his car or in his office, so that he can have the products ready with him. Then if some people who want to buy the products come to him, he can sell it to them directly or at a later time.</p>

&#8220;Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221; (pg. 35-40)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Here is complete book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Question:</b> How are we obligated to interpret the noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Answer:</b> Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, sent the Qur’aan down to the heart of His Messenger Muhammad in order to bring mankind from out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance to the light of Islaam. Allaah says: <b>“Alif-Laam-Raa. This is a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you may lead mankind from out of the darkness (of disbelief) into the light (of Islaam), by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy.”</b> [Surah Ibraaheem: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He placed His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) to clarify, interpret and explain what is in the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad), the Reminder (i.e. the Sunnah), in order for you to explain to mankind what was (already) revealed to them, and so that they may reflect.”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah came in order to explain and clarify what is found in the noble Qur’aan, and it is (also) a revelation sent by Allaah, as He says: <b>&#8220;And he (i.e. Muhammad) does not speak from his own desire. Rather, it is just revelation that is revealed to him.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“I was indeed given the Qur’aan and something similar to it along with it. It is imminent that there will come a time where a man who has eaten to his full will recline on his couch and say: ‘Stick to the Qur’aan. Whatever you find in it that is Halaal (lawful), then declare it lawful. And whatever you find in it that is Haraam (unlawful), then declare it unlawful!’ Whereas, whatever Allaah’s Messenger made unlawful is just like what Allaah made unlawful.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first source that must be used to interpret the noble Qur’aan is the Qur’an (itself) along with the Sunnah, which consists of the Prophet’s statements, actions and silent approvals. Then after that, it must be interpreted using the interpretations (tafseer) of the people of knowledge, at the head of whom are the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And the foremost amongst the Companions with regard to this subject (tafseer) is ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). This is due to several factors, one being that he was one of the first to accompany the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) (i.e. accept Islaam), and another being that he (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) would give strong emphasis to asking about, understanding, and interpreting the Qur’aan. Then after him comes ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), about whom ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>“He is the interpreter (turjumaan) of the Qur’aan.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after them, any Companion whose interpretation (tafseer) of an ayah can be authentically confirmed – and there exists no difference of opinion amongst the Companions regarding it, we accept this interpretation (tafseer) from him with full contentment, submission and reliance. And if no such tafseer can be found (from the Companions) regarding a particular ayah, then we take its tafseer from the Taabi’een, particularly those who specialized in studying tafseer under the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), such as Sa’eed bin Jubair, Taawoos and others who are well known for their studying of tafseer under some of the Companions, particularly Ibn ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), as we mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, there are some ayaat that are interpreted according to a certain opinion or madh-hab (school of Jurisprudence), and for which no direct explanation from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) can be found. So because of this, some latter-day individuals relied solely on applying such ayahs according to their madh-hab in order to interpret them. And this is an extremely dangerous matter – where ayaat are interpreted in order to support one’s madh-hab and (personal) views – whereas the scholars of tafseer have interpreted these verses in a different way than the adherents of these madhaahib have interpreted them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps, we should mention an example of this, which is Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20] Some of the adherents of certain madhaahib have interpreted this ayah to refer to just the recitation itself, meaning: What is obligatory to recite from the Qur’aan in all of the prayers is just one long ayah or three short ayaat. They said this in spite of there being reported the authentic hadeeth from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan).”</b> And in another hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basis of proof indicated in these two hadeeths is rejected by the afore-mentioned interpretation of the above ayah, which is that the ayah refers to the recitation of the Qur’aan in general. And according to them, it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan except with the Sunnah that came in mutawaatir[1] form – meaning it is not permitted to interpret the mutawaatir except with the mutawaatir. So because of this, they rejected the two previously mentioned hadeeth due to their relying on their opinion or madh-hab for the interpretation of this ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, all of the scholars of tafseer, past and present, have explained that the meaning of the noble ayah <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan”</b> is: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” This is since Allaah mentioned this part of the ayah in connection to His saying (i.e. the complete ayah): <b>“Verily, your Lord knows that you stand (to pray at night) a little less than two thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. And Allaah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to pray the entire night, so He has turned to you (in mercy). So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last part means: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” Therefore, the ayah is not in reference to what a person is obligated to recite specifically during the night prayer. Rather, (in this ayah), Allaah facilitates for the Muslims to pray what they are able to perform from the Night Prayer. This means that they are not obligated to pray what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) used to pray, which was eleven rak’aat, as you are aware of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning of the ayah. It is phrased in an Arabic style of “applying a portion, by which the whole is intended.” Thus, Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite”</b> means <b>“So pray.”</b> The prayer is the whole, while the recitation (in prayer) is the portion. The purpose of this phrasing is to clarify the importance of this portion with respect to that whole. Another example of this is Allaah’s statement: <b>“Perform the prayer from midday until the darkness of the night (Dhuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Ishaa), and (also) the (recitation of the) Qur’aan of Fajr (dawn).”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <b>“the Qur’aan of Fajr”</b> is “the Fajr Prayer.” So in this situation also, the portion is applied but the whole is intended. This is a style in the Arabic Language that is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after showing the interpretation of this ayah from the scholars of tafseer, without there being any difference of opinion amongst the past and present from them, it is not permissible to reject the first and second hadeeths (mentioned previously), claiming that they are ahead, and that it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan with ahaad hadeeth! This is since the afore-mentioned ayah was interpreted by the statements of the scholars who are knowledgeable of the language of the Qur’aan. This is first, and secondly, it is because the hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>)(<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) does not contradict the Qur’aan, but rather, it explains and clarifies it, as we explained in the beginning of this discussion. How can this be when this ayah has no relation to the subject of what a Muslim is obligated to recite during prayer, regardless of whether it is an obligatory or recommended prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the two afore-mentioned hadeeths, then it is clear that they both are on the subject of a person’s prayer not being valid unless he recites Surah Al-Faatihah in it: <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan)”</b> and <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the prayer is defective. So whoever finishes his prayer while it is deficient, then he in fact didn’t pray at all. And his prayer at this point becomes invalid, as is apparent in the first hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this reality becomes clear to us, we must therefore feel secure with the ahaadeeth that come to us from the Prophet, which are reported in the books of Sunnah, firstly, and with their authentic chains of narration, secondly. And we must have no doubts or uncertainties about them due to some philosophical approach to the ahaadeeth, which we hear about in current times, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only accept the ahaad ahaadeeth on issues regarding rulings, and not for issues regarding creed. This is since matters of creed cannot be established based on ahaad ahaadeeth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what they claim! Yet we know for a fact that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) sent Mu’aadh (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) to call the People of the Scripture to believe in Tawheed, and he was just one individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief discussion is sufficient with regard to this topic that I wanted to clarify, which is related to: How are we obligated to interpret the Noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His Peace and Blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Recompense, and all praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] A Mutawaatir hadeeth is a narration that has been reported by a group of people that is so large that it is impossible to conceive that they conspired to lie regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] An Ahaad hadeeth is a narration reported by just one narrator. It is the opposite of Mutawaatir. A Mutawaatir hadeeth is a narration that has been reported by a group of people that is so large that it is impossible to conceive that they conspired to lie regarding it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah<br />
</span>Source:His monumental book Ad-Daa wad-Dawaa [The Sickness and the Cure] (pg.22 -23)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">al-ibaanah Publications</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here there occurs a <strong>very popular question</strong> and it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">If the thing that is being supplicated for is already decreed for the servant, then there is no doubt that it is going to come to pass for him, regardless of whether he supplicates for it or not. And if it has not been decreed for him, then it will not come to pass, regardless of whether he asks Allaah for it or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">There is one group that perceives this question to be valid and so they have abandoned the supplication and are of the view that there is no benefit in doing it. These people, along with their excessive ignorance and misguidance are in clear contradiction, for if we were to follow their opinion, it would require us to reject all the different means for attaining something (desired).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it can be said to one of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If satisfying your appetite and quenching your thirst were already decreed for you, then there is no doubt that they are going to come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don&#8217;t. And if they were not decreed for you, they will not come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, if a child were decreed for you, then you will definitely receive it, whether you have sexual intercourse with your wife or you don&#8217;t. And if that was not decreed for you, then it will not come to pass. Thus there is no need for marrying, having sexual relations and so on and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who says such a statement? Is it one possessing common sense or a beast? Rather, even the animal has a natural inclination (fitrah) towards seeking the means of attaining something (desired), which (for example) will give it sustenance and livelihood. So the animals have more common sense and possess more understanding than these types of people who are like cattle – nay, far worse!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Some of them try to be clever and say:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Preoccupying oneself with supplication falls into the realm of worship solely – Allaah will reward the one supplicating, without that having an effect on what he is asking for in any way. According to this type of person, there is no difference between supplicating and refraining from supplicating by heart and tongue, with regard to that having an effect on attaining what is being asked for. And according to them, the relation of the supplication to it (what is being asked for) is like its relation with silence. There is no difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another group, more slick than this one says:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the supplication is a sign, which Allaah displays as a symbol that a matter has been carried out. So when Allaah grants his servant the ability to supplicate, it is a sign and a symbol that the matter he was requesting has been carried out. This is just as if one were to see a frigid black cloud during the winter season. It is a sign and an implication that it will rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: Similarly is enacting good deeds with respect to reward, and committing disbelief and sins with respect to punishment – they are pure signs for the occurrence of (either) reward or punishment – not means (by which the result will be attained).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, according to them, with the matters of breaking, kindling and destroying – none of these things serves as a means for the occurrence (result) of a wreck, fire and death, respectively. Nor is there any connection between those things and what results from them, other than the fact that they are normally paired together – not that one is caused due to the means of the other!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have contradicted perceptual observation and common sense with this opinion, as well as revelation and fitrah (natural inclination), not to mention all of the other intellectual groups. Rather, those with intellects laugh at them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The correct view:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a third category, apart from those mentioned by the questioner. And it is that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>the decreed result is preordained along with its proper means, which lead to its occurrence. One of these means is the supplication</strong></span>. It is not preordained just like that, without any means (leading to its occurrence), rather it is preordained along with its proper means (which will ensure its occurrence). So when a person comes across the means, the decreed matter will come to pass. And if he does not come across those means, the decreed matter is denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So satisfying one’s appetite and quenching one’s thirst are preordained with (the means of) eating and drinking. Children are preordained with (the means of) sexual intercourse. Harvesting crops is preordained with (the means of) planting and, the withdrawal of the soul from an animal is decreed with slaughter. Likewise, entrance into Paradise is preordained with (good) deeds, while entrance into the Hellfire is preordained with (bad) deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category is the true one. And it is the one that the questioner has been deprived of and not granted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Tags: dua can change destiny hadith, dua can change taqdeer hadith, can dua change destiny of marriage, nothing can change the divine decree except dua, can dua change qadr islamqa, nothing can change qadr except dua</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Author: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: His book Tanbeehaat ‘alaa Ahkaam takhtassu bil-Mu’minaat (pg. 62-67)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Translator: Isma&#8217;eel Alarcon </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting the month of Ramadaan is an obligation on every male and female Muslim, and it is one of the pillars and great foundations of Islaam. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you in order that you may attain Taqwaa.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 183]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>&#8220;kutiba&#8221;</i></b> (prescribed) here means <b><i>&#8220;furida&#8221;</i></b> obligated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the young girl reaches the age in which she will be held accountable for her actions, by having one of the signs of puberty become apparent in her, among which is menstruation, then the obligation of fasting begins for her. She could begin menstruating as early as when she is nine years old. However, some young girls are not aware that they are required to begin fasting at that point, so she doesn’t fast thinking that she is too young, nor do her parents order her to fast. This is a great negligence, for one of the pillars of Islaam is being abandoned. If this occurs to any woman, she is obligated to make up for the days of fasting that she abandoned since the point when she began menstruating, even if a long time has passed since that time, for it remains in her obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Who is obligated to fast Ramadaan?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the month of Ramadaan comes, every male and female Muslim that (1) has reached the age of <strong>puberty</strong>, is (2) <strong>healthy</strong> and (3) a <strong>resident</strong> (i.e. not traveling) is obligated to fast. And whoever is sick or traveling during the month, may break the fast and make up the number of days missed on other days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;So whoever sights the (moon indicating the beginning of the) month, then he must fast. And whoever is sick or on a journey, then (he may break the fast and instead fast) the number of days missed on other days.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever enters into Ramadaan and he is very old and not able to fast or has a chronic illness, which does not expect to be cured any specific time &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; may break the fast and instead feed a needy person half a <i>saa’</i> (four handfuls) of the food from that people’s land for every day missed. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And as for those who can fast (but) with difficulty, they (may break their fast and) feed a needy person.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 184] Ibn ‘Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhuma) said: &#8220;This ayah is for the old man of whom it is not anticipated that he will be cured.&#8221; [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree] And the sick person of whom it is not hoped that he will be cured from his sickness falls under the ruling of the old person. And he does not have to make up the missed days because of his inability to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is specified with certain excuses that permit her to break the fast in Ramadaan, on the condition that she makes up the days she missed fasting due to these excuses on other days. These excuses are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>1. Menstrual and Postpartum Bleeding:</b></span> A woman is forbidden from fasting while she is in these two conditions. And she is obligated to make up these missed days of fasting on other days. This is based on what is reported in the two Saheeh collections from ‘Aa’isha (radhi Allaahu anha) who said: <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">We were ordered to make up the (missed) days of fasting but we were not ordered to make up the (missed) prayers</span>.&#8221;</b> She gave this answer when a woman asked her: &#8220;Why does a menstruating woman have to make up the (missed days of) fasting and not have to make up the (missed) prayers?&#8221; So she (radhi Allaahu anha) clarified that this is from the matters dependent on revelation, which must comply with the reported texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wisdom behind that, then Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in <i>&#8220;Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa&#8221;</i> (15/251):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The blood that comes out of the woman because of menstruation has a discharge of blood in it. A menstruating woman can fast in times other than when the blood that comes out of her due to menstruation contains her blood. So her fasting in this situation is a moderate and balanced fast &#8211; no blood, which strengthens the body and which is its main substance &#8211; comes out of her during these times. But her fasting when she is menstruating necessitates that her blood come out during this time &#8211; the blood, which is the main component of her body and which will lead to a weakness and deficiency in her body. And this will necessitate that her fast not be that of a moderate and balanced nature. So that is why she is commanded to fast in times when she is not menstruating.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>2. Pregnancy and Breast-Feeding:</b></span> If because of fasting there is harm caused to the woman or the baby or to both of them, then she may break the fast while she is pregnant or breastfeeding. But if the harm for which reason she is breaking her fast only applies to her baby and not her, then she must make up for the days she missed of fasting and feed a needy person for each day missed. And if the harm only applies to herself, then it is sufficient for her to only make up the missed days. This is based on the pregnant woman and breastfeeding woman falling under the generality of Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And for those who can fast (but) with difficulty, they (may break their fast) and instead feed a needy person.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 184]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said in his Tafseer (1/379):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Amongst those who fall into the meaning of this ayah are the pregnant and breastfeeding women if they fear for themselves or for their children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a pregnant woman fears for her fetus, then she may not fast and instead make up each day of fasting that was missed on other days and feed a needy person around 2 kilograms of bread.&#8221; [<i>Majmoo’-ul-Fatawaa</i>: 25/318]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><b>Important Notes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>1. <i>Istihaadah</i> (Irregular Bleeding):</b></span> This is the condition in which a woman has blood come out of her, which is not her menstrual blood. She must observe the fast and it is not permissible for her to break her fast because of this type of bleeding. When mentioning the allowance of the menstruating woman of breaking her fast, Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is contrary to the woman in the state of <i>Istihaadah</i>, for this state comprises an unfixed period of time, and there is not a time in it in which she can be commanded to begin fasting (again). So because of this, it is not possible to caution against it, the same as for throwing up unexpectedly, emitting blood due to a wound, getting a boil, <i>Ihtilaam</i> (when sexual fluid comes out of the private parts not due to intercourse or foreplay), as well as all the other things that do not have a fixed time in which they could be cautioned against. So this (<i>Istihaadah</i>) was not made as something that nullifies the fast, such as the blood of menstruation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<i>Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa</i>: 25/251]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>2. The Menstruating woman as well as the pregnant and breastfeeding women</b>,</span> if they break their fast in Ramadaan, must make up for the missed days of fasting in the time that occurs between the Ramadaan in which they broke their fast and the forthcoming Ramadaan. But to complete them early is better. And if there only remain a few days before the next Ramadaan begins, then they are obligated to make up the missed days of fasting (from the previous Ramadaan) such that the new Ramadaan will not come upon them while they still have to fast days from the previous Ramadaan. But if they don’t do this and Ramadaan comes upon them while they still owe days of fasting from the previous Ramadaan, and they have no (valid) excuse for delaying it, they are obligated to make up the missed days and to feed a needy person for each day. But if they have a valid excuse, then they must only make up the missed days of fasting. This goes the same for those who must make up the missed days of fasting due to sickness or traveling. Their ruling is like the ruling of the woman who broke the fast due to menses, with the previously mentioned details.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>3. It is not permissible for a woman to observe a recommended fast</b></span> if her husband is present unless she has his permission. This is based on what Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others have reported from Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast while her husband is present except with his permission.&#8221;</b> In some narrations of the hadeeth in Ahmad and Abu Dawood, there occurs the wording <b>&#8220;&#8230;except Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> But if the husband permits her to observe a recommended fast or he is not present around her or if she doesn’t have a husband, then it is encouraged for her to observe this recommended day of fasting. This is especially for the days in which it is recommended to fast such as Mondays and Thursdays, three days in every month, six days in Shawaal, the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the Day of ‘Arafah and the Day of ‘Aashooraa along with the day before or after it. However, she should not observe a recommended fast while she owes days to make up for (the previous) Ramadaan, until she first makes up these missed days and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>4. If a menstruating woman stops bleeding during the day in Ramadaan</b></span>, she must begin her fasting for the remainder of the day but still make it up with the days that she didn’t fast because of menses. Her fasting for the remainder of the day in which she stops bleeding is an obligation on her out of respect for the time (i.e. Ramadaan).</p>

Tamaam-un-Nas&#8217;h fee Ahkaam-il-Mas&#8217;h ( which is an appendix to his checking of the book Al-Mas&#8217;h &#8216;alaal-Jawrabayn of Imaam Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee)<br />
Translated by isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 1. Wiping over the shoes: </strong>As for wiping over the shoes (<em>na&#8217;alayn</em>) [1] when performing ablution, then it has become popular amongst the contemporaries to say that it is not permissible to wipe over them. And we do not know of any evidence to support that claim, other than what has been stated by Al- Bayhaqee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) in his <em>Sunan</em> (1/288):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The <em>asl</em> is the obligation for washing the feet, unless there is an established aspect of the Sunnah that makes it more specific, or there is a consensus (<em>ijmaa&#8217;</em>) in which there is no differing. And wiping over the shoes or the socks is not included in any of the two, and Allaah knows best.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he has stated. And it is well known, unfortunately, that it indicates an unawareness of the previously mentioned ahaadeeth in this treatise [2] regarding the establishment of wiping over the socks and the shoes. And the chains of narration regarding some of them are authentic, as has been clarified previously. This is why At- Turkmanee Al-Hanafee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented on these words, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is incorrect, for it has preceded that At- Tirmidhee has authenticated the (hadeeth of) wiping over the socks and the shoes and declared it hasan from the hadeeth of Muzayl on Al- Mugheerah (radhiAllaahu anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also declared the hadeeth of Ad- Dahhaak on Abu Moosaa (radhiAllaahu anhu) to be hasan. Also, Ibn Hibbaan has verified wiping over the shoes by authenticating the hadeeth of Aws (radhiAllaahu anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Ibn Khuzaimah [2] has authenticated the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu anhu) on wiping over the shoes. And what Al-Bayhaqee mentioned from the hadeeth of Zayd Ibn Al-Hibaab on Ath-Thawree (meaning with the chain of narration going to Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu anhu) and it was stated previously) regarding wiping over the shoes, is a good hadeeth. Ibn Al- Qataan has also authenticated it on Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu anhu).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Jawhar-un-Naqee</em> (1/288)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that once you have come to know this, it is not permissible to even hesitate in accepting this allowance &#8211; especially after the hadeeth concerning it have been established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since, as the author (Al- Qaasimee) has stated in what has been mentioned previously: &#8220;The hadeeth concerning it are authentic, thus there is no recourse other than to hear and obey.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case after knowing that the Sahaabah acted in accordance with it. And foremost amongst them, was the rightly guided Khaleefah, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib (raa). Furthermore, it is the view that was held by some of the Imaams from the pious predecessors (<em>Salaf As-Saalih</em>), may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Ibn Hazm (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said in <em>Al-Muhallaa</em> (2/103):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Issue: So if the footwear (<em>khuff</em>) are cut so that they fall beneath the ankles, then wiping over them is permissible. This is the opinion of Al- Awzaa&#8217;ee and it has been reported on him that he said: &#8216;The <em>muhrim</em> may wipe over his shoes that come beneath the ankles&#8230;&#8217; Others have stated: &#8216;He may not wipe over them unless they go over the ankles.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 2. Wiping over khuffs or socks that have holes in them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wiping over <em>khuffs</em> (leather socks) or socks that are torn with holes, then the scholars have differed in this issue with many opinions. The majority of them forbid it based on a long differing amongst them, which you can see in the detailed discussions found in the books of Fiqh and Al-Muhallaa. Other scholars held the opinion that it was permissible, and this is the opinion that we favor. Our argument for this is that: the source principle is the (absolute) allowance for wiping. So whoever forbids it, or places a condition on it &#8211; such as that they must be void of any holes &#8211; or he places limits to it, then he is refuted by the statement of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Every condition that is not found in the Book of Allaah, then it is false.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been authentically reported that Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said: &#8220;Wipe over them (the socks) so long as they are attached to your feet. Were the socks of the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar anything but torn (with holes), ripped and tattered?&#8221; [Reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq in <em>Al-Musannaf</em> (no.753 ) and from that path of narration, by Al-Bayhaqee (1/283)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So if there is found in the khuffs, or whatever is worn on the feet, any holes that are small or large, long or wide, such that some part of the foot is visible, whether a little or a lot, or both, then all of that is the same. And wiping over them is permissible, so long as any part of it continues to attach itself to the feet. This is the opinion of Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, Dawood, Abu Thawr, Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih and Yazeed Ibn Haaroon.&#8221; [<em>Al-Muhallaa</em> (2/100)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) goes on to relate the statements of the scholars that forbid it, according to what they contain from differing and contradiction. And then he goes on to refute them and explain that it is an opinion that has no evidence to support it except opinion. Then he closed that with his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;However the truth in this matter is what is reported in the Sunnah, which explains the Qur&#8217;aan, in that the ruling for the two feet, which do not have any garment over them to wipe over, is that they must be washed. And the ruling for the two, if there is a garment over them, is that they can be wiped over. This is what is reported in the Sunnah <strong>&#8216;and your Lord is not forgetful.&#8217;</strong> [Surah Maryan:64 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) knew, when he commanded for the wiping over the <em>khuffs</em> or whatever is worn on the feet &#8211; and he wiped over the socks &#8211; that there was large and small holes, as well as no holes, in the shoes, socks and whatever else is worn on the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) also knew that there existed the footwear that was red, black or white as well as the new and the old. But he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) did not specify some of it over another. And if the ruling for that in the Religion varied, then Allaah would not have forgotten to send down revelation concerning it, nor would the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) have neglected explaining it, far is he removed from that. Thus, it is correct that the ruling for this wiping applies to all conditions.&#8221; [<em>Al-Muhallaa</em> (2/100)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Shaikh- ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said in his <em>Ikhtiyaaraat</em> (pg.13 ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is permissible to wipe over the (foot) garments on one of its two sides &#8211; Ibn Tameem and others related this. It is also permissible to wipe over the <em>khuff</em> that has holes in it, so long as it continues to hold that name (khuff) and one is able to walk in it. This is the older of the two opinions Ash- Shaafi&#8217;ee held on it, and it is that which Abul-Barakaat and other scholars have preferred.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Ar-Raafi&#8217;ee attributed this view in <em>Sharh Al-Wajeez</em> (2/370) to the majority of the scholars and uses as a support for it, his argument that the opinion that forbids wiping over them, narrows the door of this allowance, so one must wipe. And he was correct, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. Does taking off the footwear that is wiped over, nullify the ablution?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have also differed concerning the one who takes off the <em>khuff</em> and its types after having performed ablution and wiped over them. Their differing can be divided into three opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First: His ablution is valid and he is not required to do anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second: He must wash his two feet only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third: He must redo his ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each of these opinions were held by groups of scholars among the predecessors (Salaf). &#8216; Abd-ur-Razzaaq (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) has transmitted their narrations regarding these opinions in his <em>Al-Musannaf</em> (1/210/809-813), as well as Ibn Abee Shaybah (1/187-188) and Al-Bayhaqee (1/289-290).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the first opinion is what is most correct, for it is in correspondence with the essence of wiping, in that it is an allowance and a facilitation from Allaah. Thus any opinion, other than the first, would deny this facilitation, as has been stated by Ar-Raafi&#8217;ee in the previous Issue (#2). Furthermore, the other two opinions are outweighed by two arguments, based on the following two evidences:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> First:</strong> It complies with the action of the rightly guided Khaleefah &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib (raa), for we have presented previously with an authentic chain of narration, that he (raa) once broke his ablution, then performed a new one and wiped over his shoes. Then he took them off and prayed (without them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Second:</strong> It is in compliance with the correct analogy, for indeed if one were to wipe over his head and then shave his hair off, he would not be obligated to wipe over his head again, since he would already have ablution. This is the opinion that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) favored, as he states in his <em>Ikhtiyaaraat</em> (page15 ):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The ablution of the one who has wiped over his <em>khuffs</em> and turban is not canceled when he removes either of these two garments. Nor is it canceled by the cessation of its time limit (for wiping). And he is not obligated to wipe over his head nor is he required to wash his feet (because of removing the head or foot garment). This is the view of Al- Hasan Al-Basree. This (view) takes the similitude of the hair that is wiped, according to the correct opinion of the Hanbalee madh-hab and the opinion of the majority of the scholars.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the view of Ibn Hazm (<em>rahimahullaah</em>), so refer to his words in which he argues against those that oppose it, for indeed it is valuable. [See <em>Al- Muhallaa</em> (2/105-109)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been reported by Ibn Abee Shayba (1/187) and Al-Bayhaqee (1/289) on the authority of a man among the Prophet&#8217;s companions, who when asked about a person that wiped over his khuffs, then took them off, said: &#8220;He should wash his feet.&#8221; Then in the chain of narration of this hadeeth is Yazeed Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan ad-Daalaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said of him: &#8220;He is truthful, however he made too many mistakes in his narration. And he used to commit <em>tadlees</em>. Al- Bayhaqee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) reported a similar narration from Abu Bakrah (raa). The narrators of this hadeeth are all reliable except for &#8216;Alee Ibn Muhammad Al- Qurshee, for I do not know of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) reported from Al- Mugheerah Ibn Shu&#8217;aba that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Wiping over the footwear is three days for the traveler and one day for the resident, so long as he doesn&#8217;t remove them.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said. &#8220;&#8216; Umar Ibn Rudaih is alone in reporting this and he is not a strong reporter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that this addition of <strong>&#8220;so long as he doesn&#8217;t remove them&#8221;</strong> is rejected due to the loneliness of this weak narrator in reporting it and due to the lack of there being any supporting evidence for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator&#8217;s Note:</strong> The word used in this treatise for shoes is na&#8217;alayn, which can mean sandals or shoes that do not pass the ankle. At the time of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) , the people used to wear these sandals, which were considered shoes. We have decided to translate the word as shoes for fear that if the word sandals were used, people would limit the ruling found in this treatise to just sandals, while the rulings apply to any type of shoe worn on the foot. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Translator&#8217;s Note:</strong> The treatise he is referring to is Al-Mas-h &#8216;Alaa Al-Jawrabain (Wiping over the Socks) by the great scholar of Shaam Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee (rahimahullaah). This treatise of Shaikh Al-Albaanee comes directly after his checking of Al-Qaasimee&#8217;s book. Al-Albaanee included this last section to the book in order to clarify common misunderstandings present today and to compliment the book. Thus, there will be some references made to this book, such as &#8220;as has been stated previously&#8221;. This means previously in the book Al-Mas-h &#8216;Alaa Al-Jawrabain.</p>

<td><strong> 4. When does the time limit for wiping begin?</strong></p>
<p>There are two well-known views of the scholars concerning this issue:</p>
<p>The First: It begins at the point when the ablution is broken (for the first time), after having put on the footwear.</p>
<p>The second: It begins at the point when the first wiping occurs after, having broken the ablution.</p>
<p>Abu Haneefah, Ash- Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ahmad and their companions held the first opinion. And we do not know of any evidence on their part, which deserves mentioning, other than that it was simply an opinion. It is for this reason that some of their companions (i.e. from the same madh-hab) have contradicted them, as we shall mention. Nor do we know any of the predecessors from the Sahaabah that opposed the second view, for their guide was the authentic ahaadeeth and the ruling of &#8216;Umar Ibn Al- Khattaab (raa).</p>
<p>As for the Sunnah, then there are the authentic ahaadeeth, which were reported on many of the companions, in Saheeh Muslim, the Four Sunan collections, the Musnads and others. In these narrations, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) commanded wiping. In some narrations he allowed the wiping. And in one narration, he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prescribed wiping the length of one day and one night for the resident and three days and three nights for the traveler.</p>
<p>From the matters that are extremely evident, is that this hadeeth serves as a determining factor for the commencement of the time period for wiping, in that it begins immediately after the (first) wiping. It also serves as a refutation for the first opinion, since that (opinion) necessitates, as is determined in the subsidiary issues (furoo&#8217;), that the person that prays the Fajr prayer shortly before the rising of the sun, then breaks his ablution (for the first time) during the time of Fajr on the second day. Then performs a new ablution and wipes over his footwear for the first time for the Fajr prayer, that he is not permitted to wipe over them after that! So is it truthful to say that this person has performed the wiping for &#8220;a day and a night&#8221;?!</p>
<p>If we go according to the second opinion, the one that is most correct, then he is able to wipe over his footwear until shortly before the Fajr prayer of the third day. Rather, they hold even a more strange view than that of what we have mentioned. And it is that: &#8220;If one excretes and doesn&#8217;t wipe over his footwear, such that a day and a night, or three if he is a traveler, comes to pass, after the excretion. The time limit comes to an end and wiping is not permissible after that, until he takes off his footwear, renews his ablution and then puts his footwear back on.&#8221; [An-Nawawee mentioned this opinion in his Majmoo&#8217; (1/476)]</p>
<p>Thus, they prevent an individual from making use of this allowance (<em>rukh-sah</em>), basing it upon this opinion, which is in opposition to the Sunnah! For this reason, Imaam An-Nawawee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) was left with no choice but to go in contradiction to his madh-hab, due to the strength of the evidence, even though he was keen not to contradict it (the Shaafi&#8217;ee madh-hab) if he was able to. So after relating the first opinion and those that held it, he (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee and Abu Thawr said: &#8216;The commencement of the time limit begins at the point of the (first) wiping (over the footwear) after the first breaking of the ablution.&#8217; And it is a report from Ahmad and Dawood. This is the most favorable (opinion), the one that has the most established evidences in support of it. Ibn Al- Mundhir has favored this view. And something similar to this has been related on &#8216; Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (raa). Al- Maawardee and Ash-Shaashee have reported on Al- Hasan Al- Basree that it begins when the footwear is put on. Those that say that the time limit begins at the point of the (first) wiping use as evidence, the following hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <strong>&#8216;The traveler may wipe (over his footwear) for three days.&#8217; </strong>And these ahaadeeth are authentic as has been stated previously. This hadeeth is conclusive evidence that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) wiped (over his footwear) for three days. And this would not be possible, unless the time limit began from the first wiping. And this is also because Ash- Shaafi&#8217;ee said: &#8216;If one excretes while he is a resident, (then travels) and wipes (over his footwear) while traveling, he should completes the wiping (duration) of a traveler, for the ruling for wiping applies.&#8217; Our (Shaafi&#8217;ee) companions use the hadeeth of Safwaan (raa), which has been reported by Al-Haafidh Al-Qaasim Ibn Zakariya Al-Matrazee: <strong>&#8216;&#8230;from the time of excretion to the time of excretion&#8230;&#8217; </strong>to support their view. And this is a strange addition (to the hadeeth). It is not established. And they also use Qiyaas (judgment derived by analogy) for their claim&#8230;&#8221; [<em>Al-Majmoo&#8217;</em> (1/487)]</p>
<p>I say: If the <em>Qiyaas</em> that is mentioned here, is by itself correct in its validity, then for it to be accepted and used as an evidence, it must meet the condition of not contradicting the Sunnah. But if it does contradict it, as I believe it does, then it is not permissible to incline (one&#8217;s view) towards it. For this reason it is said:</p>
<p><em> &#8220;When the narrations are mentioned, the deduction is nullified.<br />
And when the influx of Allaah comes, the influx of intellect is nullified.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>How can this analogy be correct, when it also contradicts the opinion of the rightly guided Khaleefah &#8216; Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab? I know the blind followers claim to accept the authentic Sunnah when it contradicts &#8216;Umar&#8217;s opinion, as they have done regarding the issue of the pronouncement of the third divorce. So why don&#8217;t they accept his opinion when it does conform with the Sunnah?! &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq has reported in <em>Al-Musannaf</em> on Abu &#8216;Uthmaan An-Nahdee, who said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I came upon Sa&#8217;ad and Ibn &#8216;Umar when they were both arguing in front of &#8216;Umar (raa) concerning the issue of wiping over the <em>khuffs</em>. So &#8216;Umar (raa) said: &#8216;He can wipe over them until the same hour (of the first wiping), for that day and night.'&#8221; [<em>Al-Musannaf</em> (1/209/807)]</p>
<p>I say that its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. And it is a conclusive evidence for the fact that the (time limit for) wiping begins when it is first executed over the footwear, and lasts until that same hour the next day. This is what is predominantly apparent in all the narrations that have been reported on the Sahaabah concerning the time limit for the wiping, according to what we have knowledge of, from what has been reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq and Ibn Abee Shayba in <em>Al-Musannaf</em>. As an example, I will mention what Ibn Abee Shayba (1/180) reported on &#8216;Amr Ibn Al-Haarith, that he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I traveled with &#8216;Abdullaah to the (various) cities and he wiped over his khuffs for three days, while not taking them off at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the conditions of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. Thus, the narrations from the predecessors along with the Sunnah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) have agreed with what we have stated. So hold onto it and by the Will of Allaah, you will be guided.</p>
<p><strong> 5. Does the end of the time limit cancel the ablution?</strong></p>
<p>Concerning this issue, the scholars are divided into several opinions, the most famous of which are two from the Shaafi&#8217;ee madh-hab. And they are:</p>
<p>The First: One is obligated to renew his ablution</p>
<p>The Second: It suffices him to just wash his feet</p>
<p>The Third: There is nothing required of him. Rather, his ablution is valid and he can pray while in its state, so long as he does not excrete or break it. This is what An-Nawawee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) has stated.</p>
<p>I say: This third opinion is the most strongest of them. And it is that which An-Nawawee favored, also in contradiction to his madh-hab. Thus, he said: &#8220;This opinion has been related by Ibn Al- Mundhir on Al- Hasan Al-Basree, Qataadah and Sulaimaan Ibn Harb. Ibn Al- Mundhir favored it. And it is what is the most preferable and most convincing. Our (Shaafi&#8217;ee) companions have reported it from Dawood.&#8221; [<em>Al-Majmoo&#8217;</em> (1/527)]</p>
<p>I say that Ash-Shi&#8217;araanee has related it to Imaam Maalik in <em>Al-Meezaan</em> (1/150) and An-Nawawee related it to others, so refer to it. Also, it is the opinion that Shaikh- ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah took, as you have seen in his afore-mentioned words under the Third Issue, in accordance with Ibn Hazm. And this last one (Ibn Hazm) mentions that the other scholars that held this opinion, included Ibraaheem An-Nakha&#8217;ee and Ibn Abee Lailaa.</p>
<p>Then he (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:<br />
&#8220;This is the view of which it is not permissible to take anyone other than it. This is since there is no mention in the reports that the ablution is annulled due to the body parts that are washed over or some of them, by the termination of the time limit for wiping. Indeed, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) only forbade that someone wipe over them for more than three days for the traveler and for more than one day for the resident. So whoever holds an opinion contrary to this, then he has crammed some (false) meaning into the reports that which is not present there, and into the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) that which he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) did not say. So whoever does this mistakenly, then there is nothing upon him. And whoever does it intentionally after the argument has been established against him, then he has embarked on committing one of the major sins. And nothing cancels the ablution, except for the excretion (<em>hadath</em>). And this person that has correctly performed his ablution and then does not excrete, then he is in a state of purity. And anyone that is in a state of purity can pray so long as he does not excrete or so long as there does not occur a clear text stating that his purity has been canceled, even if he doesn&#8217;t excrete. So this person, whose time limit for wiping has finished, he has not broken his ablution and there is no text that states that his state of purity has been annulled, whether on some of his body parts or all of them. So he is in a state of purity and can pray. This is until he excretes, at which point, he must take off his <em>khuffs</em> and whatever else is worn on his feet, and perform ablution. Then the time limit for wiping is renewed again. And this is the way it will always be and with Allaah lies the success.&#8221; [<em>Al-Muhallaa</em> (2/94)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: al-ibaanah.com<br />
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr occurs in the last ten nights of Ramadaan during an odd night (i.e. 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th). However the scholars differ as to if it is fixed to one of these odd nights every year or if it changes every year to a different odd-numbered night. Below are the sayings of two of our great scholars, Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen and Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee (may Allaah have mercy on both of them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Night of Al-Qadr has a Fixed Date:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best night in Ramadaan is the Night of Al-Qadr, based on the Prophet&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;Whoever performs the night prayer on the Night of Al-Qadr with firm faith and while seeking reward, his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is on the twenty-seventh night of Ramadaan according to the strongest opinion. A majority of the ahaadeeth comply with this, including the hadeeth of Zurr Ibn Hubaysh who said: &#8220;I heard Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab (raa) say when it was said to him that &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) said &#8220;Whoever performs the night prayer (every night) throughout the year will achieve the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab) said: <b>&#8220;May Allaah have mercy on him, his intention was that the people not (grow lazy) and depend solely (on just one night). By the One of whom there is no deity worthy of worship beside Him, it is indeed in Ramadaan. And by Allaah I know on which night it is. It is on the night that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) commanded us to perform the Night Prayer. It is on the twenty-seventh night. Its sign is that the sun rises on its following morning bright with no rays.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one report this is raised to being a saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Imaam Al-Albaanee in his book <i>Qiyaam Ramadaan</i> (pg. 18-19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Night of Al-Qadr is to be sought:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr is in the last ten nights of Ramadaan, based on the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;Search for the Night of Al-Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] And it falls in one of the odd nights more likely than on the even nights, based on the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Search for the Night of Al-Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten nights of Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree] And it is closer to the last seven nights, based on the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa) that: <b>&#8220;Some men from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saw the Night of Al-Qadr in a dream during the last seven nights (of Ramadaan). So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8216;I see that all of your dreams agree that it (the Night of Al-Qadr) is in the last seven nights. So whoever wants to search for it, then let him search for it in the last seven nights.'&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] And it is also based on the hadeeth in Muslim from Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Look for it in the last ten nights. But if one of you becomes weak or is unable, then do not let the remaining (last) seven nights overcome him.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the odd nights in the last seven nights, it is closest to the twenty-seventh night due to the hadeeth of Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab (raa) who said: <b>&#8220;By Allaah, I know which night it is. It is on the night that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) commanded us to perform the Night Prayer. It is on the twenty-seventh night.&#8221;</b> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr is not specified to one fixed night throughout all the years. Rather, it constantly changes. So one year it could occur on the twenty-seventh night for example and on another year it could occur on the twenty-fifth night, according to Allaah&#8217;s Will and Wisdom. What directs us to this is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Look for it (i.e. the Night of Al-Qadr) when there remain nine nights, when there remains seven nights, or when there remains five nights (i.e. 21st, 23rd, and 25th respectively without mention of 27th).&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in <i>Fath-ul-Baaree</i>: &#8220;The most strongest opinion is that it is on an odd night in the last ten nights and that it constantly changes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has hidden knowledge of its occurrence from His servants out of mercy for them so that they can increase their actions in the search for it during these honorable nights, by praying, making <i>dhikr</i> and supplicating. So they grow and increase in the nearness to Allaah and His reward. And He also kept it hidden from them as a test for them to distinguish who amongst them struggles and makes an effort to find it and who is lazy and negligent. This is since whoever constantly strives for something, he will exert himself in his search for it and trouble himself in finding it and achieving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And perhaps Allaah discloses the time of its occurrence to some of His servants through signs and signals, which one is able to see, just as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saw its sign that he would be prostrating in mud on its following morning. So it rained on that night and he prayed the (following) morning (Fajr) prayer in mud.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Source:Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan [pgs. 41-43] Abridged</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (al-manhaj.com)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the wisdom of fasting is that: It is an act of worship done for Allaah, in which the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>‘abd</i> (servant) draws closer to His Lord</strong></span> by abandoning the things that he loves and desires, such as food, drink and sexual intercourse. So because of this, the truthfulness of his Faith and the completeness of his servitude to Allaah become apparent, as well as his love for Allaah and his longing for what Allaah has prepared for him (of good). This is since the one who fasts does not abandon something that is beloved to him except for that which is greater to him than it (which is Allaah). When the believer knows that Allaah’s contentment lies in the fasting &#8211; which is abandoning those desires that he naturally loves &#8211; he will give his Lord’s contentment precedence over his desires. So he abandons his desires no matter how much he longs and yearns for them, because his delight and the tranquility of his soul lies in his abandoning all that for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting is that it is <strong><span style="color:#993300;">a means of attaining <em>Taqwaa</em></span></strong>, as Allaah says: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, in order that you gain <em>Taqwaa</em>.&#8221;</b> This is since a person who is fasting is commanded to do the obligatory duties and to avoid sinful acts. The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever does not abandon false speech, acting upon that (false speech) and (acts of) ignorance (i.e. sins), then Allaah has no need of him abandoning his food and drink.&#8221;</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree] So when a person is fasting, every time he desires to do a sinful act, he will remember that he is fasting and thus withhold himself from that. This is why the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) ordered the person who is fasting, when cursed at and abused, to say: <b>&#8220;I am fasting&#8221;</b>, cautioning him (the reviler) that a person fasting is commanded to refrain from cursing and reviling, and reminding himself that he is fasting and cannot react with cursing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting is that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the heart opens to contemplation and remembrance (of Allaah)</span></strong>. This is since fulfilling one’s desires leads to heedlessness and perhaps the heart becomes hardened and blinded from the truth. This is why the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) advised us to eat and drink little, where he said: <b>&#8220;The Son of Aadam does not fill a vessel worse than his stomach.&#8221;</b> [Reported by Ahmad, An-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, Handhala Al-Usaidee (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>), who was one of the scribes of Allaah’s Messenger, said to the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>): <b>&#8220;Handhala has become a hypocrite.&#8221;</b> So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <b>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221;</b> He said: <b>&#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, when we are with you, you remind us of the Hellfire and Paradise, as if we see them with our own eyes. But when we depart from you, we meet our wives and our children and our homes and we forget much (of what we heard from you).&#8221;</b> In the last part of the hadeeth, the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said to him: <b>&#8220;But O Handhala, there is a time for this and a time for that (three times).&#8221;</b> Abu Sulaymaan Ad-Daraanee said: &#8220;Indeed, when the soul hungers and thirsts, the heart softens and becomes pure. And when it is fed, the heart becomes blinded.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting is that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the person who has wealth is caused to realize the blessing of wealth that Allaah has bestowed on him</span></strong>, such that Allaah blessed him with food, drink and sexual intercourse. Many people are deprived of these things, so he should praise Allaah for these blessings and thank Him for granting him them. And he should remember his brother who is poor and who probably goes through the day starved and hungry. So he should be generous to him and give him charity so that he can clothe his barrenness and satisfy his hunger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting is that<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> it trains one to curb the soul</span></strong>, and it gives one strength to withhold his soul by its bridle, such that one can govern it and lead it towards that which is good for it and what will make it prosper. This is because the soul commands one to do evil, except for those souls that my Lord has mercy on. So when a person undoes and lets go of his (soul’s) bridle, the soul lands him into many dangers. But when he controls it and curbs it, he is able to lead it to the highest of levels and the greatest of goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom of fasting is that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the soul is broken down and restricted from having pride</span></strong>, to the point that it humbles itself to the truth and softens itself before the creation. This is because eating, drinking and having sexual intercourse with women &#8211; all of these things bring about insolence, arrogance, vanity and pride over people and over the truth. The soul preoccupies itself with trying to obtain these things because of its need for them. So when it obtains these things, the soul feels like it has conquered what it desired and so it falls into the happiness and proudness that is condemned. And this is a cause for its destruction. Only those whom Allaah protects are saved from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting is that<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> the passageways of blood (in the body) become narrow due to hunger and thirst</span></strong>, so therefore the passageways of the Devil in the human body also become narrower. This is since the Devil flows through the son of Adam like the flowing of blood, as is authentically recorded in the two <em>Saheeh</em> collections. So by fasting, the whisperings of the Devil are subdued and the strength of one’s desires and anger are subjugated. This is why the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <b>&#8220;O young men! Whoever amongst you can afford it, should get married, for it is the best means for lowering one’s gaze and the best way of keeping (one’s) private parts chaste. But whoever is not able to marry, then let him fast, for it has protection.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wisdom behind fasting are <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the health benefits that come as a result of it</span></strong>, which are attained by in-taking little food, allowing the digestive system to rest for a specified time, which lets excess wastes and excrements that are harmful to the body be discharged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how great and profound is the wisdom of Allaah, and how beneficial are His commandments to His creatures!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah, give us comprehension of Your Religion and allow us to understand the inner secrets of Your commandments. Rectify for us the affairs of our Religion and our worldly life. And forgive us and our parents and all the Muslims, by Your mercy, O Most Merciful. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) and on his family and all his Companions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I spoke in detail about this subject in my book <i>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</i> (pg. 101-115), so I felt that I should abridge that discussion here in order to make it easy for the reader and to remind him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat, which is commenced with two short rak&#8217;aat. According to the most correct opinion, these are the two rak&#8217;aat of Sunnah prayer offered after &#8216;Ishaa, or they are two specific rak&#8217;aat by which one begins the Night Prayer, as has been stated previously. Then one prays two very long rak&#8217;aat (after that). Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed, and then another two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed and another set of two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then witr is made with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat. There are eight rak&#8217;aat within them, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat. Then witr is made with five rak&#8217;aat and one does not sit nor make the <i>tasleem</i> except in the fifth rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat and then prays witr at the end with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays four rak&#8217;aat and makes one <i>tasleem</i> after the four. The he prays another four in a similar manner and ends it with three rak&#8217;aat (for witr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Would the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) remain in the sitting position after every two rak&#8217;aat, when praying a unit of four rak&#8217;aat or a unit of three rak&#8217;aat? We do not find a clear answer for this, but remaining in the sitting position (for <i>tashahhud</i>) while doing a unit of three rak&#8217;aat is not legislated (in the Religion)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays eight rak&#8217;aat and does not sit in any of them except for the eighth rak&#8217;ah. While sitting (in the eighth rak&#8217;ah), he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands up again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with one rak&#8217;ah and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>. This consists of nine rak&#8217;aat. Then he prays two rak&#8217;aat after that while in the sitting position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth Manner: </b> One prays nine rak&#8217;aat, in which he does not sit except after the sixth rak&#8217;ah. Then he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with three rak&#8217;aat and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>, etc. (the rest is the same as the previous manner)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the manners in which it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) performed the Night Prayer. It is possible to add other types of manners to it, by subtracting what one wishes from each set of rak&#8217;aat until he cuts it down to one rak&#8217;ah, acting on the previously mentioned hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b> &#8220;So whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with five rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with three rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with one rak&#8217;ah.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if one wants, he can pray these five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat with one sitting and one <i>tasleem</i>, as is stated in the Second Manner. And if he wants, he can make <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat, as is stated in the Third Manner, and this is preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying the set of five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat by sitting after every two rak&#8217;aat and not making the <i>tasleem</i>, then we did not find any authentic report that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) used to do this. The <i>asl</i> (foundation) is that it is permissible, but since the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade us from praying witr with three rak&#8217;aat indicating the reason for that by saying: <b> &#8220;And do not liken it to the Maghrib prayer.&#8221; </b> [1] So then anyone that prays the witr in three rak&#8217;aat must not liken it to the Maghrib prayer. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Making the <i>tasleem</i> between the even and odd number rak&#8217;ah (i.e. between the second and the third rak&#8217;ah). This is what is more strong and preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. One does not sit between the even and odd number (i.e. he prays three rak&#8217;aat straight with one <i>tasleem</i>), and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:&#8217;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Source:Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam: Ahkaam wa Adaab (pg. 13-15)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (for al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace be upon him) said: <b>&#8220;Ramadaan has come to you &#8211; a blessed month. Allaah has made it obligatory on you to fast in it. During this month, the gates of heaven are open, the gates of the Hellfire are closed and the evil devils are chained. To Allaah belongs a night in it, which is better than a thousand months. Whosoever is prevented from its good, then he has been deprived.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is a glad tiding to the righteous servants of Allaah, of the coming of the blessed month of Ramadaan. The Prophet (Peace be upon him) informed his Companions of its coming and it was not just a simple relaying of news. Rather, his intent was to give them the glad tidings of a magnificent time of the year, so that the righteous people who are quick to do deeds can give it its due estimate. This is because the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) explained in it (the hadeeth) what Allaah has prepared for His servants from the ways towards gaining forgiveness and His contentment &#8211; and they are many. So whoever has forgiveness escape him during the month of Ramadaan, then he has been deprived with the utmost deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the great favors and bounties that Allaah has bestowed upon His servants is that He has prepared for them meritous occasions so that they may be of profit to those who obey Him and a race for those who rush to compete (for good deeds). These meritous occasions are times for fulfilling hopes by exerting in obedience and uplifting flaws and deficiencies through self-rectification and repentance. There is not a single occasion from these virtuous times, except that Allaah has assigned in it works of obedience, by which one may draw close to Him. And Allaah possesses the most beautiful things as gifts, which He bestows upon whomsoever He wills by His Grace and Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who achieves true happiness is he who takes advantage of these virtuous months, days and hours and draws closer to His Guardian in them, by doing what is prescribed in them from acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus perhaps he will be showered with one of the many blessings of those occasions and be helped by it, with an assistance that is enough to save him from the Fire and what it contains, such as its blazing heat. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being able to reach Ramadaan is itself a magnificent bounty that is bestowed on the one who reaches it and rises to its occasion, by standing in prayer during its night and fasting during its day. In it, he returns to his Protector &#8212; from disobeying Him to obeying Him, from neglecting Him to remembering Him, from remaining distant from Him to turning towards Him in submissive repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim must be conscious of this bounty and acknowledge its magnitude. For indeed, many people are prevented from fasting, either because they die before they reach it, or because they are not capable of observing it or because they oppose and turn away from it. Thus, the one who fasts must give praise to his Lord for this bounty and should welcome this month with joy and delight that a magnificent time of the year out of all the occasions for performing obedience is welcomed. He should exert himself deeply in doing good deeds. And he should invoke Allaah to grant him the ability to fast and stand in night prayer, and that He provide him with seriousness, enthusiasm, strength, and energy in that month. And that He awaken him from heedless oversleeping so that he may take advantage of these virtuous times of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is unfortunate to find that many people do not know the value of this virtuous occasion, nor do they consider it to be sacred. So the month of Ramadaan no longer becomes a significant time for obedience, worship, reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, giving in charity and making remembrance of Allaah. Rather, to some people, it becomes a signifcant time to diversify their foods and drinks and to prepare different types of meals before the month begins. Some other people do not know Ramadaan except as a month of sleeplessness and constant recurring gatherings, while sleeping by day. This is to the point that some among them sleep past the time of the obligatory prayers, thus not praying them in congregation or in their proper times. Other people do not know Ramadaan except as a signifcant time for conducting worldly affairs, not as a significant time for conducting affairs for the Hereafter. Thus, they work busily in it, buying and selling, and they stay in the market areas, consequently abandoning the masaajid. And when they <i>do</i> pray with the people, they do so in such a hurried manner. This is because they find their pleasure in the market places. This is the extent that the notions and views (of Ramadaan) have been changed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf used to say: &#8220;Indeed Allaah, the Most High, has made the month of Ramadaan as a competition for His creatures, in which they may race with one another to His pleasure, by obeying Him. Thus, one group comes first and so they prosper and another group comes last and so they fail.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the individual does not know if this is perhaps the last Ramadaan he will ever see in his life, if he completes it. How many men, women and children have fasted with us the past year, and yet now they lie buried in the depths of the earth, relying on their good deeds. And they expected to fast many more Ramadaans. Likewise, we too shall all follow their path. Therefore, it is upon the Muslim to rejoice at this magnificent occasion for worship. And he should not renounce it, but instead busy himself with what will benefit him and what will cause its effect to remain. For what else is it, except numbered days, which are fasted in succession and which finish rapidly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah make us, as well as you, from among those who are foremost in attaining good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
</span>Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam: Ahkaam wa Adaab (pg. 27-29)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Every deed of the Son of Aadam will be rewarded ten to seven hundred times its worth. Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, said: &#8216;Except for the fast, for indeed it is for Me, and I will reward it. He leaves off his desires and his food for My sake. There are two times of joy for the one fasting. The time of joy when he breaks his fast and the time of joy when he meets His lord. And the scent coming from the mouth of the one fasting is more pleasant in the sight of Allaah than the smell of musk.'&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is proof for the virtue of fasting and the great station it possesses in the sight of Allaah. Four of its many virtues occur in this hadeeth, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who fast will receive their reward in full without any reckoning, for every good deed is rewarded ten to seven hundred times its like in worth, except for the fast. Indeed, its reward is not limited to this number, but rather Allaah will reward it with manifold its likes in worth. This is because the fast is from (the forms of) patience and Allaah has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Verily, the patient ones will be given their reward in full without any reckoning.&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee said of this (ayah): &#8220;It will neither be weighed for them nor measured, but rather it will simply be served to them as food is served.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Indeed Allaah connected the fast to Himself in conjunctive form, above all other types of deeds. And this conjunction is enough to show its noble status. This, and Allaah knows best, is due its state of encompassing the entirety of the day. Thus, one can find that the individual fasting has neglected his desires, while his soul constantly yearns after them. This, along with its lengthened duration, is not found in anything else besides the fast, especially in the days of summer due to their length and severity in heat. The individual&#8217;s abandonment of the things he desires is an act of worship, which will be rewarded. This is because the fast is a secret kept between the servant and his Lord. No one knows of it except Allaah, the most High. It is an inward (hidden) action, which cannot be seen by the creation, thus riyaa&#8217; (showing off) cannot enter into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When the one who fasts meets his Lord, he will be delighted by his fast due to what he will see in it from its abundance, good standing and his reward by having his fast accepted, which Allaah granted him in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his joy at the time when he breaks the fast, then it is due to the completion of the act of worship and its being free from evil and those things that have been forbidden in it. This is from the praiseworthy types of joy since it is a joy that emanates from the obedience to Allaah and the completion of the fast, due to which great reward has been promised. This is as Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Say: By the grace and mercy of Allaah, and by that, then rejoice.&#8221;</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The breath coming from the mouth of the one fasting is more pleasant in the sight of Allaah than the scent of musk. This beautiful smell will be for the Day of Judgement for that is the day when the rewards for deeds will be manifested. This is based on one narration of the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;&#8230;more pleasant in the sight of Allaah on the Day of Judgement&#8230;&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise it will be in the life of this world, since that is the time for the manifestation of the signs of worship, due to the report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the scent coming from the mouth of the one fasting when he breaths out from the food (he ate previously) is more pleasant in the sight of Allaah than the smell of musk&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This scent, although disliked by the people who smell it in this world will, however, be more pleasant in smell in the sight of Allaah than the scent of musk. This is because it is something that originates from the obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;The sign that will mark the believer on the Day of Judgement is the brightness (of their faces) due to their ablution (wudoo&#8217;) in this world, causing a distinction between them and the rest of the nations. And their mark on the Day of Judgement due to their fasting will be pleasant smelling breath, more pleasant in the sight of Allaah than the scent of musk. This is in order that they may be known amidst that group for that deed. We ask Allaah to grant us blessing on that day.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the merits of Ramadaan is that Allaah has distinguished those who fast with a specific door from the doors of Paradise. No one more righteous than them will enter through it. Sahl Ibn Sa&#8217;ad (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Verily, there is a door in Paradise, which is known as Ar-Rayyaan. On the Day of Judgement, the ones who fasted will enter in through it, no one other than them will enter in through it. And when they have entered, it will close, so no one will enter through it (after them).&#8221;</b> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in addition to the wording: <b>&#8220;And whosoever enters will be given to drink. And whosoever drinks will never feel thirsty again.&#8221;</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, these merits will not be attained except by the one who fasts with sincerity by abstaining from food, drink, intercourse, abstaining from hearing the unlawful, looking towards the prohibited and earning from unlawful means. Thus his body limbs must fast and abstain from sinful acts. His tongue must fast and abstain from lying, foul speech and false swearing. This is the legislated fast, the result of which will be great reward. And if this is not so, then the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) has said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever does not abandon false speech and acting upon it, then Allaah has no need for him to abandon his food and drink.&#8221;</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Perhaps, all that one who fasts will get from his fast is hunger and thirst. And perhaps all that one who stands at night in prayer will get from his standing is sleeplessness. </b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:&#8217;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Source:Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam: Ahkaam wa Adaab (pg.63-65)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan for indeed it will come on the Day of Judgement as an intercessor for its Ashaab (those who read, memorize and implement it).&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the virtues of reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, the greatness of its reward and that it will intercede for its holders on the Day of Judgement towards their entrance into Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawaas Ibn Sama&#8217;aan (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: <b>&#8216;The Qur&#8217;aan will be brought on the Day of Judgement as well as the people who used to act upon it. Surat-ul-Baqarah and Aali &#8216;Imraan will then approach them.&#8217;</b> The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) likened them to three examples, which I have not forgotten afterwards. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8216;As if they were two clouds or two dark black canopies with light between them both or like two flocks of birds stretching their wings in the air pleading for the one who recited them.'&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;The fast and the Qur&#8217;aan will intercede for the servant on the Day of Judgement. The fast will say: &#8216;My Lord, I restricted him from food and drink, so allow me to intercede for him.&#8217; And the Qur&#8217;aan will say: &#8216;I prevented him from sleeping at night, so allow me to intercede for him.&#8217; So they will be allowed to intercede.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is essential for the person fasting to recite the Qur&#8217;aan much during these blessed days and honorable nights. For indeed, there is a special virtue for the abundance of recitation in these days, which is not found in any other month. He should take advantage of the nobleness of time during this month, in which Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a special merit to reciting the Qur&#8217;aan in the nights of Ramadaan. For indeed, the night brings an end to the busy daily affairs, the enthusiasm is roused and the heart and the tongue mount upon reflecting. And Allaah is the one in whom we seek assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Jibreel used to meet with the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) during each night of Ramadaan and they would study the Qur&#8217;aan together. [4] So if making thikr (remembrance of Allaah) were better than the Qur&#8217;aan or equal to it (on these nights), they would have done that all the time or at certain times along with constantly gathering for that occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, this hadeeth illustrates the precedence of studying the Qur&#8217;aan during Ramadaan and gathering together for that occasion as well as turning towards one who is more prominent in the memorization of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The predecessors of this ummah would recite the Qur&#8217;aan constantly during Ramadaan. And when they would fast, they would sit in the masaajid and say: <b>&#8220;We will guard our fast and not backbite anyone.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would recite the Qur&#8217;aan in their prayer and out of it. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhi Allaahu anhu) would complete the recitation of the (whole) Qur&#8217;aan once a day. And some of the Salaf would complete it during their qiyaam in Ramadaan every three nights. Some of them would do it every seven days and some every ten days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee would complete the Qur&#8217;aan sixty times during Ramadaan, while reciting it outside of prayer. Al-Aswad would recite the whole Qur&#8217;aan every two nights of Ramadaan. Qataadah would always compete the Qur&#8217;aan every seven days. He would do it every three days in Ramadaan, and during the last ten days, he would do it every night. Their reports concerning that are famous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;The forbiddance of reciting the Qur&#8217;aan in less than three days (as stated in a hadeeth) has only been mentioned in regards to its being done on a normal basis. As for the specific times that are virtuous, such as the month of Ramadaan and especially the nights in which the night of Al-Qadr is sought. Or those places that are virtuous, such as Makkah for the one who enters it without residing there, then it is recommended to recite the Qur&#8217;aan a lot in these times and places, seeking the merits connected with their time and place. This is the opinion of Ahmad, Abu Ishaaq and other scholars. And the actions of others indicate that as has been stated previously.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person reciting the Qur’aan must observe the proper etiquettes of recitation. Some of them are that: He make his intention sincerely for Allaah, that he recite it whilst being in a state of purity, that he use the Siwaak and that he recite it while pondering on its meaning and observing total consciousness. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;A Book, which We have revealed to you in order that its verses may be pondered upon, so that the people of understanding may be reminded.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the etiquettes of the recitation is that one does not stop his reciting in order to speak to someone else. Indeed, when many people sit to recite the Qur&#8217;aan, and there are people sitting next to them, a majority of the time, they stop their recitation and speak to their neighbors. This is not proper since it is turning away from the recitation without a valid reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is on the one who recites, to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan, making permissible its Halaal and forbidding its Haraam, so that the Qur&#8217;aan can be a proof for him on the Day of Judgement and intercede for him in entering the gardens of bliss.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Imam Muwaffaq-ud-Deen <strong>Ibn Qudamaah Al-Maqdisee<br />
</strong>This article is taken from the book <em>Mukhtasar Minhaajul-Qaasideen </em>(p. 38-41)<br />
This article was translated by Isma&#8217;eel Ibn al-Arkaan, al-ibaanah.com</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, that in the fast (<em>Sawm</em>) is a special quality that is not found in anything else. And that is its close connection to Allaah, such that He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>The Fast (<em>Sawm</em>) is for Me and I will reward it.</strong>’’ [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This connection is enough to show the high status of fasting. Similarly, the <em>Ka’bah </em>is highly dignified due to its close connection to Him, as occurs in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And sanctify My House.</strong>’’ [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the fast is only virtuous due to two significant concepts:<br />
<strong><br />
THE FIRST:</strong> It is a secret and hidden action, thus, no one from the creation is able to see it Therefore <em>riyaa‘</em> (showing off) cannot enter into it.<br />
<strong><br />
THE SECOND:</strong> It is a means of subjugating the enemies of Allaah. This is because the road that the enemies (of Allaah) embark upon (in order to misguide the Son of Aadam) is that of desires. And eating and drinking strengthens the desires. There are many reports that indicate the merits of fasting, and they are well known</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE RECOMMENDED ACTS OF FASTING:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pre-dawn meal (<em>suhoor</em>) and delaying in taking it are preferable, as well as hastening to break the fast and doing so with dates. Generosity in giving is also recommended during <em>Ramadhaan, </em>as well as doing good deeds and increasing in charity. This is in accordance with the way of the Messenger of Allaah. It is also recommended to study the <em>Qur‘aan</em> and perform <em>I‘tikaaf</em> (seclusion for worship) during <em>Ramadhaan</em>, especially in its last ten days, as well as increasing upon the exertion (towards doing good deeds) in it. In the two <em>Saheehs</em>, ’Aa‘ishah said: ‘‘When the last ten days (of <em>Ramadhaan</em>) would come, the Prophet would tighten his waist wrapper (<em>izaar</em>)’’ [4] The scholars have mentioned two views concerning the meaning of ‘tighten his wrapper (<em>izaar</em>)’ The first is that it means the turning away from women. The second is that it is an expression denoting his eagerness and diligence in doing good deed. They also say that the reason for: the last ten days of <em>Ramadhaan </em>was due to his seeking of the Night of al-Qadr (<em>Laylatul-Qadr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AN EXPLANATION OF THE INNER SECRETS OF FASTING AND ITS CHARACTERISITCS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three levels of fasting, the general fast, the specific fast and the more specific fast. As for the general fast, then it is the refraining of ones stomach and their private parts from fulfilling their desires. The specific fast is the refraining of ones gaze, tongue, hands, feet, hearing and eyes, as well as the rest of his body parts from committing sinful acts. As for the more specific fast, then it is the heart’s abstention from its yearning after the worldly affairs and the thoughts which distance one away from Allaah, as well as its (the heart’s) abstention. From all the things that Allaah has placed on the same level. [5] From the characteristics of the specific fast is that one lowers his gaze and safeguards his tongue from the repulsive speech that is forbidden, disliked, or which has no benefit, as well as controlling the rest of his body parts. . In a <em>hadeeth</em> by al-Bukhaaree: ‘‘Whosoever does not abandon false speech and the acting upon it, Allaah is not in need off his food and drink.’’ [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another characteristic of the specific fast is that one does not overfill himself with food during the night. Instead, he eats in due measure, for indeed, the son of Aadam does not fill a vessel more evil than his stomach. If he were to eat his fill during the first part of the night, he would not make good use of himself for the remainder of the night. In the same way, if he eats to his fill for <em>suhoor</em>, he does make good use of himself until the afternoon. This is because excessive eating breads laziness and lethargy therefore, the objective of fasting disappears due to one&#8217;s excessiveness in eating, for what is indeed intended by the fast, is that one savours the taste of hunger and becomes an abandoner of desires.<strong><br />
</strong> <strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">RECOMMENDED FASTS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the recommended fasts, then know that preference for fasting is established in certain virtuous days. Some of these virtuous days happen every year, such as fasting the first six days of Shawwaal after <em>Ramadhaan</em>, fasting the day of <em>’Arafah</em>, the day of <em>’Ashooraa</em>, and the ten days of <em>Dhul-Hijjah</em> and <em>Muharram</em>. Some of them occur every month, such as the first part of the month, the middle part of it, and the last part of it. So whoever fasts the first part of it, the middle part of it and the last part of it, then he has done well. Some fasts occur every week, and they are every Monday and Thursday. The most virtuous of the recommended fasts is the fast of Daawood. He would fast one day and break his fast the next day. This achieves the following three objectives, the soul is given its share on the day the fast is broken. And on the day of fasting, it completes its share in full. The day of eating is the day of giving thanks and the day of fasting is the day of having patience. And Faith <em>(eemaan) </em>is divided into two halves- that of thankfulness and that of patience. [7] It is the most difficult struggle for the soul. This is because every time the soul gets accustomed to a certain condition, it transfers itself that. As for fasting every day, then it has been reported by Muslim, from the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Qataadah that ’Umar (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>) asked the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>): What is the case if one were to fast everyday? So he (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘‘He did not fast nor did he break his fast or, he did not fast and he did not break his fast.’’ [8] This is concerning the one who fasts continuously, even during the days in which fasting is forbidden.<strong><br />
</strong> <strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">CHARACTERISITCS OF THE MORE SPECIFIC FASTS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the one who has been given intellect, knows the objective behind fasting. Therefore, he burdens himself to the extent that he will not be unable to do that which is more beneficial than it. Ibn Mas’ood would fast very little and it is reported that he used to say: ‘‘When I fast, I grow weak in my prayer. And I prefer the prayer over the (optional) fast.’’ Some of the Companions would weaken in their recitation of the <em>Qur‘aan</em> when fasting. Thus, they would exceed in breaking their fast (i.e.. by observing less optional fasts), until they were able to balance their recitation. Every individual is knowledgeable of his condition and of what will rectify it.<strong><br />

The first of these three levels entails the abstinence which is fulfilled, the fast is considered complete in view of the one having met the legislated requirements [i.e. It does not have to be repeated or made up, the servant has indeed fasted.] The remaining levels deal with the value of the Fast. If the second is level is not met, the fast will be of less value to the servant, than if it were met and likewise for the third. Thus it is said that intentional eating and intercourse render the fast null and void, whereas committing other unlawful acts such, likes speaking falsely, placing the unlawful look to the opposite sex. And so on will constitute a sin of one degree or another, but not nullify the fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:&#8217;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Source:Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam: Ahkaam wa Adaab (pg. 133-135)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (for al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aa’ishah (raa) said: <b>&#8220;When the last ten days (of Ramadaan) would come, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would spend his night in worship, wake his family (at night), exert himself and tighten his <i>Izaar</i> (waistcloth).&#8221;</b> [1]This hadeeth is proof that the last ten days of Ramadaan have a special virtue over any other (set of days), in which one should increase in obedience and acts of worship, such as prayer, making dhikr (remembrance) and reciting the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aa’ishah (raa) has described our Prophet and role model, Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), with four attributes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would <b>&#8220;spend his night in worship&#8221;</b>, meaning he would not sleep during it. Thus, he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would remain awake throughout it in worship and he would liven his soul by spending the night in sleeplessness. This is since sleep is the brother of death. The meaning of <b>&#8220;spend his night&#8221;</b> is that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would spend all of it in the state of <i>qiyaam</i> (night prayer) and performing acts of worship that are done for the sake of Allaah, Lord of the worlds. We must remember that the last ten days of Ramadaan are fixed and numbered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been reported concerning the forbiddance of spending the entire night in prayer, which has been mentioned in the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr (raa), then it is in regards to someone who does that consistently throughout every night of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would &#8220;wake up his family&#8221; meaning his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) pure wives, the Mothers of the Believers, so that they may take part in the profiting of good, the dhikr (remembrance) and the acts of worship during these blessed times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would <b>&#8220;exert himself&#8221;</b>, meaning he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would persevere and struggle in worship, adding more to his deeds than what he had done in the first twenty days (of Ramadaan). He only did this because the night of Al-Qadr occurs during one of these (last ten) days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would <b>&#8220;tighten his <i>Izaar</i> (waistcloth)&#8221;</b> meaning he would exert himself and struggle intensely in worship. It is also said that it means he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would withdraw from women. This seems to be more correct since it inclines with what was mentioned previously and with the hadeeth of Anas (raa): <b>&#8220;He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would rollup his bed and withdraw from women (i.e. his wives).&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would observe &#8216;Itikaaf in the last ten days of Ramadaan and the person who is in the state of &#8216;Itikaaf is restricted from interacting (sexually) with women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O Muslim brother, strive to characterize yourself with these attributes. And guard the prayer you make in the depths of the night (<i>tahajjud</i>) with the Imaam in addition to the Taraaweeh prayer (which is prayed in the early parts of the night), so that your exertion in these last ten days may go beyond that of the first twenty. And so that you may achieve the attribute of <b>&#8220;spending the night in worship&#8221;</b> by praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must be patient in your obedience to Allaah, for indeed, the tahajjud (night) prayer is difficult, but its reward is great. By Allaah, it is a great opportunity in ones life and a profitable thing to take advantage of, for the one whom Allaah grants it to. And a person does not know if perhaps he will encounter one of Allaah&#8217;s many rewards during the night prayer, thus serving as assistance for him in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous predecessors of this ummah would lengthen the prayer at night, exerting themselves. As-Saa&#8217;ib Ibn Yazeed said: <b>&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab ordered Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab and Tameem Ad-Daaree to lead the people in prayer with eleven raka&#8217;aat. The reciter would recite one hundred verses, to the point that we had to lean upon wooden staffs due to the long standing. And we would not stop until the early parts of Fajr.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Abee Bakr reported: <b>&#8220;I heard my father (i.e. Abu Bakr) say: &#8216;During Ramadaan, we would finish (the night prayer) late and we would hurry the servants to present the food (of suhoor) for fear that Fajr (morning) would come upon us.&#8221;</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two struggles of the soul that the believer faces during Ramadaan: the struggle by day with fasting and the struggle by night with qiyaam (night prayer). So whosoever combines these two and fulfills their rights, then he is amongst the patient &#8212; those who will <b>&#8220;be given their reward in full without any reckoning.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ten days are the last part of the month and a person&#8217;s actions are based on his last ones. So perhaps, he will encounter the night of Al-Qadr, while standing in prayer for Allaah and thus have all his past sins forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one must incite, animate and persuade his family to perform acts of worship, especially in these great times in which no one neglects it except that he has been deprived. What is more incredible than this is that while the people are performing prayer and making tahajjud, some individuals spend their time in forbidden gatherings and sinful events. This is indeed the greatest loss. We ask Allaah for his protection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, embarking on these last days means entering into the profiting from righteous deeds in what remains of the month. From the unfortunate matters is to see that some people excel in righteous actions, such as prayer and recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan, in the first part of the month, but then signs of fatigue and weariness begin to show on them afterwards, especially when the last ten days of Ramadaan come in. And this is in spite of these last ten days possessing a greater standing than the first ones. Thus, one must persevere in striving and struggling and increase his worship when the end of the month draws near. And we must keep in mind that a person&#8217;s actions are based on his last ones.</p>

Translated by abu maryam isma’eel</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/forbidden-business-transactions-in-islaam-shaykh-fawzan-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Dowload PDF of Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam- Shaykh Fawzan- Al-Ibaanah.com</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction to the Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Recompense. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet entitled <strong>“<em>Al-Buyoo’ al-Munhee ‘anhaa fil-Islaam” </em></strong>[Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam] by the noble scholar of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, may Allaah preserve him. The original source for this book was a recording of a lecture he gave in 1411H in a masjid in Saudi Arabia . The book was chosen due to the importance of this topic amongst Muslims in the West. This is because as the number of Muslims in the lands of the West increase and the communities grow, the need for instituting Muslim-owned businesses that will support and benefit these Muslim communities also grows.And since it is not befitting for the Muslims to engage in matters without knowledge, we felt a need to present this small but informative book to our readers for the purpose of providing knowledge on those matters, which Allaah and His Messenger have warned us against and forbidden with regard to everyday business transactions. You will find that this treatise is not only intended for the businessman who buys merchandise and sells to his customers, but also for the purchasers who buy the products. The Shaikh spends much of the time focusing on several products that are forbidden to buy, sell and promote, but yet which have found their way into Muslim communities in large quantities, such as music, alcohol and cigarettes. We hope that every Muslim benefits from this book, by avoiding buying or selling those products that have been forbidden and abstaining from conducting business schemes that are against Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by: isma’eel alarcon on April 26, 2002</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Lecture: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds, and may the peace and blessings be upon the chief of all Messengers and upon his family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a short treatise on the subject of Prohibited types of business transactions, which has been compiled so that the Muslim can avoid them in his daily affairs – so that his earnings can be from the lawful, which Allaah will benefit him with in this life and the next. Originally, the source for this treatise was a lecture I gave at Masjid Sumoo Walee al-‘Ahd Al-Ameer ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Su’ood in Riyadh in the month of Jumaadal-Oolaa 1411H. The following is the transcription of that lecture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers! There is no doubt that commerce and business are two things that are required and necessary. This is because Allaah has commanded us to seek after gaining provision and sustenance for ourselves according to the proper channels generally. And specifically, He said concerning commerce (i.e. buying and selling): <em> </em><strong><em>“But Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden interest (Ribaa).”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 275]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. And when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says, praising those who combine between their seeking of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) and their performing of worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, Allaah states that from the attributes of the Muslims is that they buy and sell (i.e. they trade). But when the time for prayer comes, they leave off the buying and selling and head for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Neither trading nor business diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to seek after the means of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) along with the command to worship Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone). And be grateful to Him, to Him you will return.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So conducting business by buying and selling or any of the other types of permissible ways of earning provision is something that is required according to the Religion since tremendous benefits will result from that for both the individual and the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying and Selling, in itself, are both praiseworthy and necessary, so long as they do not cause harm to one’s worship or cause him to delay performing the prayer in congregation in the masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>The honest and trustworthy businessman will be with the prophets, martyrs and righteous people</em>.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: The businessman who buys and sells while being honest will be with these groups of people on the Day of Judgement. This is a great position, which indicates the nobility of holding such an occupation. And the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was once asked as to which kind of earning was the most purest? So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>A blessed trading (accepted by Allaah) and the labor a man does with his hand.</em>” </strong> [Reported by At-Tabaraanee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The two persons conducting a business are in a state of goodness so long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth), the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So doing business while being honest and righteous is from the best ways of earning sustenance. As for conducting business with lies, fraud, swindling and deception, then this is from the worst forms of earning sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) once passed by a group of Muslims who were buying and selling in the marketplace of Madeenah. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you gathering of traders!” So they raised their heads waiting to hear what he would say. He said: “Indeed the traders will be resurrected as sinful evil-doers (<em>fujaar</em>) except for those who fear (are dutiful to) Allaah, are righteous and honest.” </strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee who said it was hasan saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet himself (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) engaged in business transactions during the first part of his life, when he used to manage the money of Khadeejah. This was before the advent of his prophethood. And he would buy and sell and gain profit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same for the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger – they would buy and sell and trade. And there were found wealthy people amongst them who used their wealth to support the Jihaad in Allaah’s Cause, such as ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who supplied the poor in the army with equipment. And such was ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who would donate money to the Muslims at the time of need and at the time of Jihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such was Abu Bakr as-Sideeq (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) for he would buy and sell and sacrifice his wealth to support Islaam and the Muslims, from the time he was in Makkah before migrating, as well as after migrating. He would give away much and much of his wealth for the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, seeking the means of sustenance according to the permissible channels the greatest of which are buying and selling – has much good in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this buying and selling must be set with religious guidelines, so that the Muslim can avoid falling into forbidden transactions and unlawful forms of earning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong> When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.” </em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  <em>“So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>Therefore, commerce is of two types – the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter). The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.” </em></strong> [Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></strong> [Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).” [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: “They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.” So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business is: <strong>Selling a forbidden commodity</strong>. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold .So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money. This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>And he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.” </em></strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that: <strong>“There will come a people during the Last days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.” </strong>Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <strong>hasheesh and opium</strong>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal – in the eyes of the Muslims <strong><em>and </em></strong>in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <strong>cigarettes and qaat </strong>(leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <em>khubth </em>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse. So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.When one smokes, he throws away money and wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many. Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to the people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah). Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate and bless your wealth.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Another type of forbidden business is: <strong>Selling musical and entertainment instruments </strong>in all of their various forms, such as stringed instruments and wind instruments or musical appliances and all of the instruments that are used for that purpose, even if they are called by other names such as “technical apparatuses.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is Haraam (unlawful) for the Muslim to sell these instruments and appliances because it is an obligation to destroy them and not have any of them remain in the lands of the Muslims. So if this is the case, how can they be sold? And how can one take money for them? This is from the forbidden acts!</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling images (i.e.pictures, statues)</strong>. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from selling statues, and what was intended by statues was (all life) images. This is because originally statues are based on image representations, regardless of whether it is representing horses, birds, animals or human beings. Everything that has a spirit (<em>rooh</em>), then selling an image of it is Haraam, and the money made from it is Haraam.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed the image-makers and he informed us that they will be the ones with the worst and most severe punishment on the Day of Judgement. Likewise, it is not permissible to sell <strong>magazines that are filled with pictures</strong>, especially if these magazines contain immoral pictures (i.e. of naked women). This is because along with the fact that they contains pictures, which are forbidden, they also serve as <em>fitnah </em>(temptation) and an incitement towards doing evil acts. This is since when a man looks at a picture of a beautiful girl who is exposing some of her features or she is uncovering some of her body (i.e. naked), then most of the time this will rouse the man’s desires. And these desires will lead this individual to commit lewd and criminal acts. This is exactly what the devils amongst mankind and the jinn hope for by the distribution and sale of these pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from a higher perspective, is <strong>selling immoral movies </strong>(i.e. pornographic films), especially videotapes, which the Muslim communities have poured into the arena of their homes. These movies display images of naked women in them as well as images of lewd and immoral sexual acts! These movies tempt and incite the young men and women and cause them to be raised upon loving this kind of immorality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible to sell these kinds of lewd films. Rather, it is binding upon you to prevent, destroy and distance these films away from the Muslim environments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anyone who opens a store to sell (or rent) these immoral videotapes, he has in fact opened a place for the disobedience of Allaah to be conducted and he has earned unlawful and illegal money, if he uses it or spends it on his family. Rather, he has opened up a place of <em>fitnah </em>(mischief) and a fortress for the Devil.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling Tapes in which are recorded immoral songs, </strong>with the voices of male and female singers accompanied by music. And these songs consist of words that talk about lust, infatuation and craze for women. So it is forbidden (Haraam) to listen to, record and sell these songs. And taking money for it is considered unlawful earnings and illegal gains, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade severely since they spread evil and immorality. And they corrupt one’s manners and transport evil into the homes of the Muslims.</li>
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: Selling something which the buyer will use towards committing Haraam. So if the seller knows that the buyer will use the product he is buying to commit some forbidden act, then selling it to him is forbidden and void. This is because you will be assisting him upon sinfulness and transgression, and Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And help one another towards piety and fearing of Allaah, and do not help one another towards sinfulness and transgression.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, if someone buys grapes or dates for the purpose of making wine from them, or he buys a sword for the purpose of killing Muslims with it or for the purpose of committing highway robbery or to be tyrannical or a troublemaker and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone that will use a product against what Allaah has forbidden or will use it in a way Allaah has forbidden, then selling that product to him is not permissible. This is if one knows for sure that the buyer will do that or he suspects for the most part that he will do that.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a man sells something that he doesn’t own</strong>. For example, a man goes to a businessman looking for a specific product, but this businessman doesn’t have this specific product. Yet they both agree to a contract (for the sale of the product) and agree on the extent of the price (on the item) presently or in the future. And all the while, the product is not found in the possession of the businessman or the buyer. Then the businessman goes and buys this product and hands it over to the buyer after they already agreed to a price and they made a contract and determined the value as it relates to present terms or in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of business transaction is haraam. Why? Because he sold something he didn’t own and he sold something before gaining possession of it, if the product was specified. As for if the product was not specified and its price was delayed, he actually sold a debt on credit. The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from doing that, as was the case when Hakeem bin Hazaam (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) came to him, saying: “O Messenger of Allaah, what if a man comes to me wanting to buy something from me, but I don’t have it. Then I go to the marketplace and buy it for him?” The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Do not sell what you don’t have.” </strong>This is a clear cut forbiddance, therefore it is not permissible for a person to sell some specified commodity unless he is in possession of it before making a contract on it, whether he will sell it right there or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to take this matter lightly. So whoever wants to sell something to the people, then he should store the products in his store or in his shop or in a warehouse or in the trunk of his car or in his office, so that he can have the products ready with him. Then if some people who want to buy the products come to him, he can sell it to them directly or at a later time.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>The ‘Aynah Transaction</strong>.What is the ‘Aynah Transaction? It is when a product is sold to a person for a deferred price (i.e. a raised price to be paid later), then that same product is bought back from him at current value less than the deferred price for which it was given to him. So when the time comes in which the deferred payment is due, he pays his creditor in full. This is what is known as an Al-‘Aynah Transaction. It is called ‘aynah (i.e. derivate of ‘ayn = same) because the same product that was sold is returned back to its owner. This is Haraam because it is deceiving someone into interest (Ribaa). In reality, it is as if you are selling dollars at the current price for deferred dollars (i.e. to be given later), which are more than the original amount. And you are just using the product as a device or means to gaining this interest.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an obligation on you if you are owed money by someone, because you sold him some product for a deferred price that you let him sell it to someone else, or that you let him act freely in the matter – if he wishes he can keep it or if he wishes he can sell it to someone else, if he is in need of the money. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“When you deal with <em>al-‘aynah </em>transactions and you hold onto the tails of cows and you are pleased with the agriculture, Allaah will send humiliation down upon you. He will not remove it from you until you return back to your Religion.” </strong>[Reported by Abu Dawood and it has supporting evidences]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>An-Najash</strong>. What is meant by an-Najash is when you display a product for sale in a public auction. Then a person comes and bids up the price of the item, but he doesn’t intend to purchase the item, rather he only wants to raise the price for the customers intending to deceive the buyers. This is the same whether he agreed with the seller to do this or he did it on his own. So whoever bids for a product and he doesn’t want to buy it, rather he only wants to raise its price for the customers, then this person is a Naajish, who has opposed the prohibition of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). Doing this is Haraam, as the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“And do not perform Najash on each other.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 [<strong>Translator’s Note: </strong>Another example is if you sell an item that is worth $25 to someone for $50 because he will pay you next month and not now. This may be agreed because perhaps you feel the value of the item will go up by then. But for some reason, the buyer is short of money and wants to sell the item back to you, so he comes to you the next day and you make him sell it to you for the current market price, which is still $25. So when the date, next month, on which you agreed he would pay you the $50 comes, he pays you the money. So altogether you make $25 apart from the item, which is considered interest.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who has no desire or need for the item, he should not participate in the auction and not bid for it. Instead, he should leave the customers, who really desire the item, to outbid each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps a person may want to help the seller, and sympathy for the seller overcomes him. So he bids up the price of the item for the purpose of helping the seller according to his perception. Or perhaps, the seller may agree with a group of his associates to create a crowd around the item for sale in order to draw the people’s attention. These acts are considered from Najash and are Haraam because they are a means of deceiving the Muslims and a way of taking their money unjustly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the scholars of Fiqh have stated that what falls under Najash is when a seller tells his customer: “I bought this item for such and such price”, lying about the price, so that the buyer may be fooled and buy the item at an increased value. Or it is when the seller says: “I was given this product at this price” or he says: “I received it for this much”, lying about the price. He only wants to fool the customers into bidding the price up to reach this alleged and false price, which he claims he spent for the item. This is from the Najash, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade. It is a treachery and deception of the Muslims, and it is lying and disloyalty, for which he will be accountable for before Allaah. So what is obligatory on the seller is that he reveals the truth if the buyer asks him how much he got it for. He must tell him the truth and not say that he attained it for this much money, lying about the price. What also falls into the definition of An-Najash is if the people of the marketplace or the storeowners agree to not outbid one another when an item is presented for sale, for the purpose of forcing the owner to sell it for a (discounted) cheaper price. So therefore, they are all participating in this act, which is Haraam. And this is from An-Najash. It is also a form of taking the people’s money unjustly.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a Muslim conducts a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</strong> The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “And none of you should conduct a sale on top of the sale of his (Muslim) brother.” How is this done? It is done, for example, when a person who wants to buy a certain product comes and buys it from one of the businessmen, who gives him the option to finalize the deal in two or three days or more. So in this case, it is not permissible for another businessman to come and interpose, saying to the buyer: “Leave this product. I will give you the same item, even better than it, for a cheaper price.” This is Haraam because he is conducting a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, so long as he sells him the item and gives him the option (to finalize the deal later), let him obtain it and do not interfere in the deal. If he wishes, he will take the product, and if he wishes, he will cancel the deal. So if he calls off the deal due to his own choice (i.e. not being coerced or influenced), then there is nothing preventing you from selling it to him (now). (On the opposite end) conducting a purchase over his purchase is also Haraam. So if a Muslim comes and buys a product from one of the businessmen for a fixed price and is then given the option for a period of time (to finalize the deal), it is not permissible for another buyer to interfere by going to the businessman or the seller, saying: “I will buy that product from you for a higher price than that person bought it from you.” This is Haraam because these kinds of transactions cause harm to the Muslims and violate their rights and puts hatred into their hearts (for one another). This is since if a Muslim comes to know that you interfered in his transaction and you were the cause for ruining the deal that was between the two of them, he will be filled with hatred, spite and abhorrence for you. Or perhaps he may even supplicate against you, because you have oppressed him. And Allaah says: <strong>“And work with one another upon piety and fear of Allaah. And do not work with one another upon sin and transgression.” </strong>[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is: <strong>The Deceptive Sale</strong>, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them. So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade in his saying: <strong>“The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. </strong>But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their <strong> transaction is wiped out.” </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere. Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: <strong>“To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: <strong>“What is this O owner of the food?” </strong>He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has affected some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

</strong>Source:Al-Asaalah (Issue #6) [E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee]<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> What is the religious ruling concerning buying in installments?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Answer:</strong> First of all, buying in installments is an innovation of the actions that was not known to the Muslims in every preceding generation. Rather it is from the aspects that have been passed onto them from the disbelievers, those who, in the past, took over their lands, colonized them and governed over them with their rules of disbelief. Then when they departed from the lands&#8217; major districts, they left behind their evil and misguided traditions. And, today, the Muslims live upon those practices and acts that the disbelievers imposed on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another concern – which is the most important – and it is as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;I have not left anything that would bring you closer to Allaah, except that I have commanded you to do it. And I have not left anything that would distance you from Allaah, while bringing you closer to the Hellfire, except that I have forbidden you from doing it.&#8221;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we see that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade from that which today is called <strong>&#8220;buying in installments.&#8221;</strong> Therefore, this kind of business transaction is an innovation, which the Muslims of the past did not know of. I also want to say that this name is an innovation (in itself) for there is nothing found in the books of Fiqh with the name &#8220;buying in installments.&#8221; Rather, there is found in the Muslim books, that which is called <em>Ad-Dain</em> (debt) and that which is called <em>Al-Qard-ul-Hasan</em> (a goodly loan). This (latter) has become, in the daily affairs of Muslims, just a name without any form and reality to it. This is in spite of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) incitement towards giving goodly loans and his going to great extents in that, to the extent that he regarded the lending of two dollars to be as if you gave one dollar away in charity. This means: If you lend your Muslim brother two dollars, it is as if you have taken a dollar out of your pocket and given it for charity. Just as he (peace be upon him) encouraged these goodly loans, he forbade from taking extra money in exchange for delaying your brother&#8217;s payment of his end of the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> And in another hadeeth, he <strong>&#8220;forbade that two business transactions be made for one (transaction).&#8221;</strong> The reporter of this hadeeth was asked about the meaning of this forbiddance, so he responded: &#8220;It is that you say: &#8216;I will sell you this thing for such and such amount of money in cash, and for such and such (more) money in delayed payment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will sell you this appliance for 100 dollars in cash directly, and for 105 dollars in installments, meaning as a debt. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> This means that if he takes the exra money, then it is interest, as is seen in the example of the appliance that was sold for 105 dollars, five dollars more in exchange for the delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were an Islaamic rule for individuals and rulers, this buyer who was deceived and had five extra dollars taken from him in exchange for the businessman&#8217;s waiting on the delay, he would have the right to take hold of him and complain about him to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the understanding of this hadeeth. The thing being sold is one, however the offer is in two transactions: In cash directly for this amount and in delayed payment for that amount. So the increase of money for the delay in paying at once was labeled as interest by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Author:Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo<br />
</span>Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine Issue 11 (pg. 45-47) </span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, my fellow brother, that there are certain etiquettes to the Hajj, which one must abide by and adorn himself with, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Maintain cleanliness</strong></span> in your clothes, your tent, the place where you stay, and in your food and drink. This is because keeping clean will aid in preserving your health and in repelling sicknesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Beware of dropping filth or spoiled food</strong></span> in the roads that people use, for it will cause those performing Hajj to be bothered, and it will cause diseases to spread. So one must remove harmful objects from the road and put them in their proper place (i.e. garbage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Bear the harm that comes from your neighbors with patience</span></strong>, and do not (let that cause you to) harm any of your brothers. Instead, repel their harm in a manner that is better, such as by using kind words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Avoid sexual relations, committing sins, arguing and debating with falsehood, so that your Hajj can be accepted. Listen to the words of Allaah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever intends to perform Hajj therein (in the months of Hajj), then he must NOT have sexual relations, nor commit sin, nor debate unjustly during Hajj.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever goes to Hajj and he does not have sexual relations in it nor does he commit sin, he returns back (from Hajj) like the day when his mother gave birth to him (i.e. free from sins).”</strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Be lenient in your buying and selling, and show good manners</strong></span>. And do not deal with anyone in a manner that he is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Beware of smoking, displaying bad manners and insulting others</span></strong>, for reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Do not waste your time in the market places</span></strong> – buying and selling – or in gossiping with the “he said/she said” talk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Be gentle with those around you when performing Tawaaf, kissing the Stone, the Sa’ee, and when throwing the stones (<em>Ramee</em>) and so on. This is from the gentleness that is required, for Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is deprived of gentleness, he is deprived of all kinds of good.”</strong> [Reported in Saheeh Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not raise your voice out loud when making du’aa</strong></span> (supplication) during Tawaaf, because it disturbs the others making Tawaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not push and shove people</strong></span>, especially when kissing the Black Stone. If it is too crowded and there is too much shoving, it is enough for you to just point in its direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when casting the stones (<em>Ramee</em>), it is not permissible for you to use large stones, because this has been forbidden in the religious texts and because it will cause harm to those standing (in front of you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, do not throw your shoes (instead of rocks) – as some ignorant people do – for this is a reprehensible act!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Avoid touching the glass surrounding the Prophet’s grave, and avoid touching the walls of the Ka’abah. Rather what is to be touched and kissed from it is (only) the Black Stone. The Yemeni Corner is also touched. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. You must shave your head or cut your hair very short when in the state of <em>Hill</em> (out of Ihraam), but beware of shaving the beard off, for that is forbidden according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“…with (the hair on) their heads shaven or cut short…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Trim the moustaches and leave the beards to grow – Do the opposite of the Majoos.”</strong> {Reported by Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Beware of supplicating and calling out to other than Allaah, such as calling to deceased people or others not present. This is from the types of Shirk that Allaah has forbidden in His saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not call besides Allaah that which can neither bring you benefit nor cause you harm. If you do that, then you will be from the wrong-doers.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“wrong-doers”</strong> in this ayah are the polytheists (those who commit shirk). If a Muslim commits Shirk, his good deeds become nullified and his Hajj is lost, as Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And if you commit Shirk, We will surely cancel out your good deeds and you will indeed be from the losers.”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Beware of <em>Riyaa</em>,</strong></span> which is doing a deed for the sake of being seen or heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this when someone goes to Hajj so that it can be said of him <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> The title Hajji (or Al-Hajj in Arabic) was not a term that was known to the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), so we cannot hear from any of them that he said about his brother <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> Rather, this is from the innovations of those in recent times. So have sincerity in your Hajj and say as Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allaah, (this is) a Hajj with no <em>riyaa </em>or <em>sam’ah</em> in it.”</strong> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Increase in your recitation of the Qur’aan and acting on what is in it, your performing of Tawaaf, your sending of Salaat on the Prophet. And make a lot of supplication, especially at night, because Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever wakes in the night and says when he awakens: ‘<em>Laa Ilaaha IllAllaah wahdahu laa shareeka lahu. Lahul-Mulk wa lahul-Hamd wa Huwa ‘alaa Kulli shay’in Qadeer. SubhaanAllaah wal-Hamdu Lillaah wa Laa Ilaaha IllAllah wa-Allaahu Akbar wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata Illaa Billaah</em>.’[3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And then he says: ‘<em>Allaahumma Ighfir Lee</em>’ or some supplication, he will be answered. And if he makes ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.”</strong> [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner removes sins.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Timrimidhee and Ibn Khuzaimah and authenticated by Al-Albaanee in his book on Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Riyaa means doing deeds to be seen and Sam’ah means doing deeds to be heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: This means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah – alone and with no partner. To Him belongs the Dominion and the Praise and He is Able over all things. Glory be to Allaah, all praise be to Allaah, and there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah. And there is no movement nor power except by Allaah’s permission.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next phrase means: <strong>“O Allaah, forgive me.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

Translator: Isma’eel alarcon, Produced by: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-ibaanah-com/">al-ibaanah</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer:</b> is the second pillar from the pillars of Islaam and the most important pillar of Islaam after the Shahaadah (testimony) of Faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer:</b> is a link between the servant and his Lord. The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Indeed, when one of you prays, he speaks privately with his Lord</span>.&#8221; [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree] And Allaah says in the <em>qudsee</em> <em>hadeeth</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two parts, and My servant will have what he asks for.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So when the servant says: ‘<em>Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabb-il-‘Alameen</em>’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has praised Me.’And when he says: ‘<em>Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</em>’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has extolled Me.’ And when he says: ‘<em>Maaliki-yawm-id-Deen</em>’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has honored Me.’ And when he says: ‘<em>Iyyaaka Na’bdu wa Iyyaaka Nasta’een</em>’, Allaah says: ‘This is between Me and My servant and My servant will have what he asks for.’ And when he says: ‘<em>Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem. Siraat-aladheena an’amta ‘alaihim. Ghairil-Maghdoobi ‘alaihim wa lad-Daalleen</em>’, Allaah says: ‘This is for My servant and for My servant will be what he asks for.’&#8221;</span> [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer:</b> is a garden of ‘<em>ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship), in which every splendid type of worship is found. There is the <em>takbeer</em>, by which the prayer is initiated, the standing in which the person praying recites the words of Allaah, the bowing in which he extols his Lord, the rising from the bowing position, which is filled with the praising of Allaah, the prostration in which he glorifies Allaah by His highness and in which he implores him through supplication, the sitting in which there is the <em>tashahhud</em> and (more) supplication and the closing with <em>tasleem</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer: </b>is a means of support and assistance in times of distress and grief. And it prevents one from evil and shameful deeds. Allaah says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Seek assistance in patience and prayer.</span>&#8221; And He says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book and establish the prayer. Verily, the prayer prevents one from evil and shameful deeds.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer: </b>is the light of the believers in their hearts and in their place of gathering (on the Day of Judgement). The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The prayer is light.&#8221;</span> And he (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever guards it (his prayers), it will be a light, a proof and a (means of) salvation for him on the Day of Judgement.&#8221; </span>[Reported by Ahmad, Ibn Hibbaan and At-Tabaraanee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer: </b>is the joy and delight of the believers’ souls. The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#808000;">My delight was placed in the prayer</span><b>.&#8221;</b> [Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasaa’ee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer: </b>wipes away sins and expiates evil deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Do you think that if there was a river by the door of one of you and he bathed in it five times a day that there would remain any dirt on him?</span>&#8221; They (the Companions) answered: &#8220;There would not remain any dirt on him.&#8221; The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">That is how it is with the five (daily) prayers, through them Allaah washes away the (minor) sins</span>.&#8221; [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The five (daily) prayers and Jumu’ah (prayer) to Jumu’ah (prayer) are an expiation for what (sins) occur between them so long as one is not guilty of major sins.&#8221;</span> [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prayer in Congregation: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) reported that the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Prayer in congregation is better than praying alone by twenty-seven degrees</span>.&#8221; [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) said: &#8220;Whoever would be happy to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, then let him preserve (in establishing) these five prayers from the place where they are called from (i.e. masjids), for verily, Allaah has legislated for your Prophet the ways of guidance. And indeed these (five prayers in the masjid) are from the ways of guidance. And if you were to pray in your homes as this man who refrains (to pray in the masjid) prays in his home, then you would have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you were to abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) you would go astray. There is not a man that performs the ablution and does it well, then sets out to go to one of these masjids except that Allaah records a good deed for him for every step he takes and raises him up one level and erases one evil deed due to it. You have certainly seen us, and no one would refrain from the prayer (in the masjid) except the hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And indeed a man would be brought supported by two men until he was made to stand in the row (for prayer).&#8221; [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Al-Khushoo’ (Submissiveness) in the Prayer</b>, which means that 1) the heart is present and attentive, and 2) preserving that condition &#8211; are both from the means of entering Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Successful indeed are the believers. Those who in their prayers are submissive. And those who turn away from vain talk. And those who pay their <em>Zakaat</em>. And those who protect their private parts &#8211; Except in front of their spouses or those (women) whom their right hands possess, for indeed they are not held to blame (in that). So whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors. And those who keep their trusts and covenants. And those who preserve their prayers. They are the inheritors &#8211; the ones who will inherit <em>Al-Firdaus </em>(highest level in Paradise), in which they will abide forever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being sincere to Allaah in the prayer and performing it according to the manner it is described in the Sunnah are the two fundamental conditions for its acceptance. The Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: <span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Verily, actions are by intentions and every person will have what he intended.&#8221;</span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] And he (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Pray as you have seen me pray</span>.&#8221; [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine: Issue 13-14 (Contained in the E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> What is the religious ruling concerning holding a second congregational prayer in the masjid?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> The scholars of Fiqh have differed with regard to the ruling on holding the second congregational prayer. However, before we mention the difference of opinion and clarify which is the most correct of them, we must first identify the type of congregation that they differ on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of disagreement is with regard to the congregation that is established in a masjid that has a regular employed Imaam and mu’adhin. As for the congregations that are established in any other place, be it in ones home, a masjid built on the road (i.e. musalla) or a store, then there is nothing that prevents one from having repeated congregations in those places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars who hold the opinion that it is disliked to have numerous congregations in the above type of masjid, the one that has a regular Imaam and a regular mu’adhin, derive their ruling from two evidences. The first is textual and comes from the Divine Legislator, while the other is theoretical and it is a contemplation of the narrations and the wisdom behind the prescription of the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual evidence, then they have investigated and found that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went throughout his life leading the people in congregational prayer in his masjid. Nevertheless, whenever any individual from his Companions entered the masjid and found that the congregational prayer had finished, he would pray alone and he would not wait (for others to come). Nor would he turn towards his left or right, as the people do today, looking for one or more people so that one of them can pray with them as an Imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf never used to do any of this. So when one of them would enter the masjid and find that the people had prayed, he would pray by himself. This is what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee concluded in his book <i>Al-Umm</i>, and his discussion on this topic is from the moist comprehensive of talks that I have seen from the discussions of the Imaams on this issue, such that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a group of people enter a masjid and find that the Imaam has already prayed, then they should pray individually. But if they pray in a congregation, then their prayer is acceptable and correct, however, I hate that they do this for it was not from the customs of the Salaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;As for the masjid that is on the highway, which doesn&#8217;t have a regular employed Imaam and mu&#8217;adhin, then there is no harm in holding numerous congregational prayers in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;And we have memorized that a group from the Prophet&#8217;s Companions missed the congregational prayer, so they prayed individually. Even though they had the ability to congregate and pray together a second time, they did not do this because they hated to hold the (same) congregational prayer in the masjid twice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee. And what he mentioned that the Companions used to pray individually when they would miss the congregational prayer, has been mentioned as a ta&#8217;leeq narration in shortened form. And Al-Haafidh Abu Bakr Ibn Abee Shaybah transferred that to his famous book <i>Al-Musannaf</i>. He reported it with a strong chain of narration on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree that when the Companions would miss prayer in congregation, they would pray individually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qaasim related this understanding in his <i>Mudawwanat-ul-Imaam Maalik</i> on a group of the Salaf, such as Naafi&#8217; the servant of Ibn &#8216;Umar, Saalim Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah and others, that when they would miss the prayer, they would pray individually and they would not establish the congregation a second time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Imaam At-Tabaraanee reported in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam Al-Kabeer</i> with a good chain of narration from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood that he went out one day with two of his companions from his house to the masjid in order to pray in the congregation. But when they got there, they found the people leaving the masjid for they had finished the prayer. So he returned to his home and led them in prayer. So this returning of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; being who he was due to his accompaniment of the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his knowledge and understanding of Islaam &#8211; if he knew the prescription of praying numerous congregations in one masjid, he would have entered with his two companions and prayed in congregation with them. This is since he knew the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;The best prayer of a man is the one he performs in his house, except for the obligatory prayer.&#8221;</b> So what was it that prevented Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) from praying this obligatory prayer in the masjid? &#8211; his knowledge that if he prayed it in the masjid, he would have to pray it alone. So he held that if he congregated in his home that would be better than if he and those with him prayed individually by themselves in the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a collection of the quotes that support the point of view of the majority of the scholars that have disliked numerous congregations held in the described masjid in the manner mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, people will not miss finding other evidences, while doing some deduction and precise investigation. Thus, the two Imaams, Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, have reported from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, <b>&#8220;I felt a strong desire to command a man to lead the people in prayer. Then command some men to fetch firewood, then go to the people who have left off praying in congregation and set their houses on fire. By the One in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is, if one of them knew that he would find two good hunted game in the masjid, he would surely come to witness the two.&#8221;</b> In this hadeeth, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) threatened those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer in the masjid with burning them with fire. I believe that this hadeeth alone informs us of the previously mentioned ruling or it informs us of what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee has stated and what Ibn Abee Shaybah has related. And that was that the Companions would not repeat the prayer in congregation in the masjid. This is since, if we were to assume that the second and third congregations were legislated in the masjid, then there came this severe threat from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to those who refrained from the congregational prayer, which congregation is it that they are refraining from? And for which congregation that they refrained from attending was this severe threat intended?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said: &#8220;For the first congregation&#8221;, then it must said: These other congregations are not legislated. And if it is said: &#8220;This severe threat only applies to the one who refrains from every congregation, however many even if their number is continuous. So then in this case, the argument of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) against anyone of those people who refrained from any of the congregations would not be established at all. This is since if he were to surprise one of them, after having put someone in charge to lead the prayer, by going to his house and finding him spending leisure time with his wife and children. And so he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would reprimand him for this, saying: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go pray in congregation?&#8221; He would simply reply to him: &#8220;I will pray with the second or third congregation.&#8221; So will the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) argument be established against him? Due to this, the Messenger&#8217;s strong desire to authorize someone to take his place and for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to surprise those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer and burn their houses down, is the greatest proof that there is no second congregation at all. This is with respect to the textual reports that the scholars have relied on for support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the investigation, then it is from the following angle: There are many ahaadeeth reported that state the virtue of the prayer in congregation. From them is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Prayer in congregation is better than praying alone by twenty-five &#8211; and in one report &#8211; by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So this great virtue was only stated for the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is stated in other ahaadeeth that: <b>&#8220;The prayer of a man along with another man is more purer in the sight of Allaah, than his praying alone. And the prayer of a man along with two other men is purer in the sight of Allaah than his praying with one man.&#8221;</b> This is because every time the congregation increases in its number of individuals, its reward multiplies with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we keep this understanding in mind and then look at the consequences of the opinion that allows the holding of numerous congregations in the masjid that has a regular Imaam, then it has the worst consequences. This is because the opinion for holding repetitive congregations will lead to the minimizing of the amount of people who attend the first congregation. And this contradicts the incitement that we find in the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;The prayer of one man along with another man is purer that his praying alone&#8221;</b> since this hadeeth encourages that there be many people in the congregation. And holding the opinion that the congregations can be repeated in the masjid, by necessity, leads towards a minimization of the amount of people in the prescribed first congregation and a division of the Muslims&#8217; unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is something else that requires careful examination. And it is that we must remember that the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) in Saheeh Muslim, similar to the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa): <b>&#8220;I strongly desired to command a man and so he would lead the people in prayer.&#8221;</b> It was stated with respect to those who refrained from performing the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. So when we know that Ibn Mas’ood (raa) placed a threat, of a specific type, on every person that refrains from attending the Jumu’ah and the congregational prayer, then we realize that these two prayers are with regard to their link to the congregation. For indeed, this threat means that there is to be no second congregation after any of these two prayers. Thus, the Jumu’ah prayer &#8211; until now &#8211; is preserved in its singularity and there is no opinion held stating that it is prescribed to have numerous (Jumu’ah) prayers in one masjid. All of the scholars, in spite of their differences agree on this. Due to this, we can see the masjids crowded with people on the day of Jumu’ah. And if it doesn’t escape out minds, we must remember that from the causes of the masjids being filled on the day of Jumu’ah is that there are those who attend Jumu’ah yet do not attend any of the other (regular) prayers. However, there is no doubt that the cause for the masjids being filled with people on the day of Jumu’ah is that the Muslims do not practice &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; the act of repeating the Jumu’ah prayer (continuously) in the same masjid. So if the Muslims were to treat the congregational prayer like they treat the Jumu’ah prayer and like the way the matter was during the time of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), the masjids would be filled with people. This is since every person that constantly prays in congregation will always have in his mind that if he misses the first congregation, he will not be able to attain it after that. So this belief will serve as an incentive for him to closely guard his attending of the congregational prayer. And the opposite is true also. If a Muslim holds inside that if he misses this first congregation, then he can always find a second one or a third one or sometimes even a tenth one, then this is from the things that weaken his enthusiasm and aspiration in attending the first congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two things that remain before us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First we must clarify that those who held the view that the second congregation, according to the particularization mentioned previously, was not legislated, and who said that doing it was disliked, they are the majority of the Imaams of the Salaf. Amongst them are the three Imaams &#8211; Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ash-Shaafi’ee. Imaam Ahmad is also amongst them according to one report. However, this report is not well known amongst his followers today, even though one of his most specialized students, Abu Dawood As-Sijistaanee mentioned it. Thus, he reported from him in his book <i>Masaa’il Al-Imaam Ahmad</i> that he (Ahmad) said: &#8220;Repeating the congregational prayer in the two sacred masjids (i.e. of Makkah and Madinah) bears the highest level of disapproval (<i>kiraaha</i>).&#8221; So this, from the aspect of preference, indicates to us that there also exists the disapproval of repeating the congregations in other masjids as well. However, it (the level of disapproval) is more severe in the two (sacred) masjids. So in this report, Imaam Ahmad is in conformity with the other three Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, the other report on Imaam Ahmad &#8211; the one which is more known to his students &#8211; he (rahimahullaah) and those interpreters who followed him, base their support for it on a hadeeth reported by At-Tirmidhee, Imaam Ahmad and others. It is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, in which he said: <b>&#8220;A man entered the masjid when the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) had already prayed and his Companions were gathered around him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This man wanted to pray, so the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: ‘Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?’ So a man stood up and prayed with him.&#8221;</b> And in the report of Abu Bakr Al-Baihaqee, which is found in his Sunan Al-Kubraa, it is stated that this man was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq. However, this report has weakness in its chain. The report that is authentic doesn’t name the man in it. So these (scholars) have used this hadeeth as evidence and say: &#8220;The Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of the second congregation!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response to the use of this evidence is that we must consider that the congregation, which the hadeeth talks about, is not the same congregation that is being indicated in the question. This is since the congregation that the hadeeth refers to the congregation of a man who enters the masjid after the first congregation has finished and wants to pray alone. But the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) incited those of his Companions who had prayed with him already to let one of them get up and volunteer and pray a voluntary prayer. So someone did it and that is the way it occurred. So this congregation consists of two people: The one leading the prayer (imaam) and the one being led (ma’moom). The Imaam is praying his obligatory prayer, while the ma’moom is praying a voluntary prayer. So who is the one who put this congregation together? If it were not for the one praying voluntarily, there would be no congregation. So therefore, this is a supererogatory and voluntary congregation, and not an obligatory congregation. And the differing (mentioned in the question) is only with regard to the second obligatory congregation. So due to this, using the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree as evidence for this area of dispute is not correct. And what further confirms this is the fact that the hadeeth states: <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?&#8221;</b> In this incident that occurred, there was someone who gave charity and there was someone who received charity. So if we were to ask a person with the least amount of knowledge and understanding: &#8220;Who is the one giving the charity and who is the one receiving the charity in this situation, which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of?&#8221; The answer would be: &#8220;The one giving the charity is the person praying the voluntary prayer, who had already prayed the obligatory prayer behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), while the one who is receiving the charity is the person who arrived late.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if we were to throw this same question on the congregation that is in dispute right now: for example six or seven people enter the masjid, and find that the Imaam has already prayed. So one of them leads the prayer and the rest follow him in a second congregation. So who is the one giving the charity amongst these people? And who is the one receiving the charity? No one can give the same answer as in the first example. So this congregation (of people) that has entered after the Imaam finished praying, all of them are praying their obligatory prayer. There is no one giving charity, nor is there anyone receiving charity. On the contrary, this obscurity is quite obvious and clear in the first example. The one giving charity is the person who is praying the voluntary prayer, who already prayed behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). His prayer was recorded as twenty-seven levels (of reward). So because of that, he is rich and therefore able to give away in charity to others. And the one who leads the prayer &#8211; and if it were not for that person giving charity, he would have prayed alone &#8211; he is poor and in need for someone to give him charity. This is since he did not earn what the person who is giving him charity earned (from reward).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason for this person being the one giving the charity and that person being the one receiving the charity is clear. As for the scenario that is in dispute now, then the scenario is not clear, for all of the people (praying) are poor, since they have all missed out on the virtue of the first congregation. So the saying of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him&#8221;</b> doesn’t apply here. Therefore, in a situation like this, it is not valid to use this incident (mentioned in the hadeeth) as evidence. Nor can it be used in reference to this issue, which is the area of our discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will link this to another evidence they use as proof, which is the Prophet’s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Praying in the congregation is more virtuous than praying alone by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So they use the generality (in the hadeeth) as evidence, meaning they understand that the word &#8220;the&#8221; before the word congregation is for a general inclusion (of all congregations). This means that (according to them) every congregational prayer is more virtuous than praying alone. We respond by saying, basing it on the previously mentioned evidences that &#8220;the&#8221; is not for a general inclusion, but rather it is for a specific designation. This means that the congregational prayer &#8211; which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prescribed, incited towards, ordered the people to attend, threatened those who abandoned it with burning their houses and which those who abandoned it were described as being hypocrites &#8211; is the prayer in congregation that is more virtuous than praying alone. And it is the first congregational prayer. And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Pulling someone back from the complete row to avoid praying alone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If you enter the masjid and the first row of prayer is complete, can you pull someone from it behind so that he can pray with you (in the second row) or should you just pray by yourself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hadeeth about pulling someone back from the first row so that one would not pray alone in the second row were authentic, it would be obligatory to base the opinion on it. However, its chain of narration is not authentic, as I have explained in <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> and <em>As-Silsilah Ad- Da&#8217;eefah</em> (second volume).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore so long as this hadeeth is not authentic, then the person who enters the masjid and the row of prayer in front of him is complete, he must try to squeeze into the row that is before him. This is possible in most cases, during this era in which a majority of Muslims have abandoned the act of joining tightly (by squeezing together) in the lines of prayer, for many of them do not stand close together in the lines of prayer. So if he finds that the row is complete, he should try his best to find an empty space in it, even if he has to gesture to the one he wants to pray next to, to make some space for him to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he is not able to do this, either because the people in the row are closely packed together or because some of the people praying do not make room for him, then he could stand in the second row by himself, and his prayer will be valid. This is because the Prophet&#8217;s saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays in the row by himself</span>&#8221; is only in reference to the extent of one’s ability and adequacy to perform all the rest of the acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know, for example, that standing for the obligatory prayer is a pillar (of the prayer). Therefore, if one prays sitting while he has the ability to stand, his prayer is not valid. However, if he is not able to stand, then he could pray sitting, as the Prophet, <em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Pray standing. But if you are not able to, then sitting. But if you are not able to, then on your bed.</span>&#8221; This goes the same for the case of the individual who prays behind the row by himself, in that his condition is that he is not able to join into the row that is before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays alone behind the row</span>&#8220;, is most likely applicable to the person that takes this issue lightly or to the one who turns away from this legal ruling. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As has been done by many people, especially those <em>mu&#8217;addhins</em> who do not join into the rows, but rather pray by themselves in places near to the door (of the masjid). So these individuals are the ones whom the hadeeth is directed to</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the man who enters the masjid and tries to join into the row but is not able to, nor does anyone come that will join him (in the second row), then he can pray by himself. And Allaah does not burden a soul with a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability to fulfill the responsibility. And this is the view of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
Source: Sharh Lum&#8217;atul-&#8216;Itiqaad (pg. 20-27) with checking and notes from Ashraf Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Maqsood [Dar Al-Istiqamah Printing]<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before entering into the core of this book, I would first like to introduce some important principles related to Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Principle:</strong> What is obligatory from the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah regarding Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, it is obligatory (concerning Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes) to leave their proofs and implications upon their literal meanings, without changing them. This is because Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan in a plain Arabic language and the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) used to speak with the Arabic language. Therefore, it is obligatory to leave the implications of the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) as they are, in that language. Also, changing it from its literal meaning is speaking about Allaah without knowledge and this is forbidden, due to the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Say: &#8216;The things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are the great evil sins, whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge.'&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-A&#8217;araaf (7): 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this principle is found in the statement of Allaah: <strong>&#8220;Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, what is literally apparent from this ayah is that Allaah has two actual hands. Thus, affirming that is obligatory, due to this principle. So if someone were to say that the meaning of His hands is &#8220;power&#8221;, then we must say to him that this is changing the word from its literal meaning. And saying this is not permissible, for it is speaking about Allaah without knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Principle:</strong> Concerning Allaah&#8217;s Names</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several subdivisions included in this principle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The first subdivision:</strong> All of Allaah&#8217;s Names are the best</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they all possess the highest extent of goodness. This is since they are comprised of perfect attributes. There are no deficiencies to be found in them in any way whatsoever, for Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;To Him belong the best of Names.&#8221;</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 5-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the name Ar-Rahmaan, which is one of the Names of Allaah, for it demonstrates a magnificent attribute &#8211; which is (His) vast mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that Ad-Dahr (time) is not one of the Names of Allaah, for it does not possess a meaning that reaches the highest extent of goodness. As for the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) statement: <strong>&#8220;Do not curse time, for indeed, Allaah is Ad-Dahr (time)&#8221;</strong>,[2] then its meaning is that He is the &#8220;Owner of time &#8211; the One who dispenses it&#8221;. This change occurs based on the evidence found in his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) statement in the second narration (of this hadeeth) in which Allaah said: &#8220;In My hand is the Command. I turn (in cycles) the night and the day.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Subdivision:</strong> The Names of Allaah are not confined to a fixed and definite number</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is based on the famous hadeeth: <strong>&#8220;I ask You, O Allaah, by every one of Your Names by which You have named Yourself or revealed in Your Book. Or (those which You have) taught to one of Your creatures or appropriated for Yourself in the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen) that is with You.&#8221;</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifying and grasping whatever Allaah has appropriated for Himself in the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen) that is with Him, is impossible to attain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to combine between this hadeeth and the other authentic hadeeth: <strong>&#8220;Verily, to Allaah belong ninety-nine names, (by which) whosoever takes account of them (i.e. memorizes, learns and supplicates by them), will enter Paradise &#8220;</strong> [5] s that the meaning of this (latter) hadeeth is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from among all the names of Allaah are ninety-nine names by which if someone takes account of them, he will enter Paradise .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that Allaah&#8217;s names are restricted to this number (of 99).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The equivalent of this would be if one were to say: &#8220;I have one hundred dollars which I have counted out for the purpose of giving in charity.&#8221; This does not negate that he has other dollars in his possession, which he has counted out for a purpose other than charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Subdivision:</strong> The Names of Allaah are not affirmed by the intellect &#8211; they can only be affirmed by Revelation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Names of Allaah are based upon Revelation and as such, their affirmation is dependent upon what is reported in the revealed texts concerning them. Therefore, nothing can be added to them nor subtracted. This is because the intellect is not able to itself ascertain which names Allaah is most deserving of. So it is obligatory to depend upon the revealed texts for determining that. Also, naming Allaah with that which He did not name Himself or rejecting what He did name Himself with, is a crime against Him and a perpetration of His right. Thus, abiding by the proper etiquettes with regard to that is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Subdivision:</strong> The meaning of each of Allaah&#8217;s Names applies to 1) Allaah Himself, 2) the attribute that such a Name implies, and 3) the effect of such an attribute, if it is transitive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah&#8217;s names cannot be complete without affirming all of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of those names that are not transitive is the name Al-&#8216;Adheem (The Most Great). One&#8217;s Faith is not complete until he believes that it is a name of Allaah whose meaning applies to Him Himself, as well as the attribute that it encompasses, which is His magnificence (&#8216;adhamah). An example of a name that is transitive is Ar-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful). One&#8217;s Faith is not complete until he believes that it is a name of Allaah that applies to 1) Himself, 2) the attribute that it encompasses, which is his mercy, and 3) what results from that, which is that he grants mercy to whom He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Principle: Concerning Allaah&#8217;s Attributes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also subdivisions included in this principle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Subdivision:</strong> All of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes are of the highest degree of perfection and praise possible. There is no deficiency found in them in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some examples of these Attributes are: (His) living, knowledge, ability, hearing, seeing, wisdom, mercy, highness and other than these. This is based on His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;And to Allaah belongs the highest description.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-un-Nahl (16): 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also because the Lord is absolutely perfect; thus His Attributes must be perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an attribute is deficient and imperfect, then it is restricted from Him, such as death, ignorance, inability, deafness, blindness, and other than that. This is because Allaah will punish those who describe Him with deficiencies and He has freed Himself from all the defects that they attribute to Him. Also, it is not possible for the Lord (Rabb) to have a defect due to the incompatibility of deficiency with the aspect of Lordship (Rububiyyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an attribute is perfect in one way and deficient in another way, then it is not affirmed for Allaah nor is it restricted from Him in the absolute sense. Rather, a distinction between the two cases must be made. Thus, it is affirmed for Allaah in the circumstances when it is perfect and it is not possible to affirm it for Him in the condition when it is deficient. Examples of this are planning (Makr), plotting (Kaid), deception (Khadaa&#8217;) and so on. These three attributes are perfect when they are implemented as a response to their equals (being done by an opponent), since they indicate that the One who is doing it is not incapable of encountering His enemy with his same action. And it would be deficient in any other condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is affirmed for Allaah in the first condition and not in the second. Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;They (disbelievers) were planning and Allaah too was planning (i.e. makr). And Allaah is the best of those who plan.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Anfaal (8): 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Verily, they are but scheming a plot. And I too am scheming a plot (i.e. <em>kaid</em>).&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ut-Taariq (86): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He who deceives (i.e. khadaa&#8217;) them.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-un-Nisaa (4): 142]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if for instance, it is said: &#8220;Has Allaah attributed plotting to Himself?&#8221; Then do not say yes, and do not say no. Instead say: &#8220;He is plotting against those who are deserving of that, and Allaah knows best.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Subdivision:</strong> The Attributes of Allaah can be divided into two categories: Those that are affirmed (Thubootiyyah) and those that are negated (Salbiyyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Thubootiyyah:</em></strong> consists of the attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself, such as living, knowledge and ability. Affirming these for Allaah in a manner befitting to Him is obligatory. This is because Allaah has affirmed them for Himself and He is the most knowledgeable concerning His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Salbiyyah:</em></strong> consists of the attributes that Allaah has negated for Himself, such as injustice. Negating these from Allaah is obligatory because Allaah has negated them from Himself. However, it is obligatory to believe in affirming their most perfect opposites, for Allaah, since a negation is not complete until it consists of an affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is Allaah&#8217;s statement: <strong>&#8220;And your Lord treats no one with injustice.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Kahf (18): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory to negate injustice from Allaah, while affirming (the opposite) &#8211; which is justice &#8211; for Him, based on its most perfect perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Subdivision:</strong> The Affirmed Attributes (Thubootiyyah) can further be divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Dhaatiyyah</em> (Attributes of His Essence):</strong> They are the attributes that do not cease nor will ever cease to be descriptive of Him, such as hearing and seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Fi&#8217;aliyyah</em> (Attributes of His Actions):</strong> They are the attributes that are connected to His Will (Mashee&#8217;ah). If He wills, He will do it and if He wills, He will not do it, such as rising over the Throne and (His) coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that an attribute could be both Dhaatiyyah and Fi&#8217;aliyyah, according to each of the two, such as Speech. In regards to the origin of the attribute, it is an attribute of His Essence (Dhaatiyyah) because Allaah never stopped nor will stop speaking. And in regards to the units of Speech that are put forth, it is an attribute of the action (Fi&#8217;aliyyah), since Speech is connected to His Will. He speaks as He wills, when He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Subdivision:</strong> Each Attribute of Allaah should bring three questions to mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first question: Is it real (as opposed to figurative) and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question: Is it permissible to say how it is and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question: Is it comparable to the attributes of creation and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to the first question: Yes, it is real, because the foundation of speech concerning this subject is based on actuality (as opposed to symbolism). This may not be abandoned, unless there is authentic evidence that restricts it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second answer: No, it is not permissible to describe how an attribute is, due to Allaah&#8217;s statement: <strong>&#8220;But they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the intellects are not able to comprehend the nature of how Allaah&#8217;s attributes are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third answer: It cannot be compared to the creation&#8217;s attributes, due to Allaah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ush-Shooraa (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also Allaah is worthy of the utmost perfection, therefore it is impossible for Him to be compared to the creation, since that is something deficient and imperfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between takyeef (saying how it is) and tamtheel (saying it is like such and such) is that tamtheel is to describe the manner of an attribute by restricting it to a certain example, whereas takyeef is describing the manner of an attribute without restricting it to a certain example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of <strong><em>tamtheel</em></strong> is if someone were to say the hand of Allaah is like the hand of a human being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of <strong><em>takyeef</em></strong> is to imagine that the Hand of Allaah has a specific nature that has no comparison found in the hands of created beings. This type of imagining is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Principle:</strong> What may be used to refute those who commit ta&#8217;teel (rejection of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mu&#8217;tilah (those who commit ta&#8217;teel) are the ones who reject anything from the Names and Attributes of Allaah and distort the texts from their literal meanings. They are also known as the ones who commit ta&#8217;weel (distorted interpretation). The fundamental principle by which we may refute them is to say that their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Are in contradiction to what is literally apparent from the texts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Are in contradiction to the understanding of the Salaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Do not have any authentic proof (to support them)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some attributes, there may be a fourth perspective, or more than that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue #21<br />
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing the Muslim scholars do not differ about at all is the fact that Islaam is established upon two magnificent and great fundamental principles. Indeed they are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) worshipping only Allaah apart from others and<br />
2) following and taking our example from only the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) apart from others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what I want to discuss here only concerns the principle that states: A Muslim’s Eemaan does not become complete until he believes that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah. And that if any person on the face of this earth were to bear witness to Allaah’s Oneness according to the three categories (of Tawheed), then he will not be a believer until he adds to that his belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is His slave and messenger. So if it is this way, then it is required for every Muslim to learn the meaning of this beautiful statement (of Tawheed): <strong> “So know that Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah)” [Surah Muhammad: 19]</strong> and to acknowledge the true sense of its meaning in two parts. First, to believe in it and second, to put it into actuality in himself, his worship and his belief in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” This testimony (of bearing witness that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger) completes the first testimony (of bearing witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So due to this, the testimony (of Faith) does not become complete unless the Muslim believes in this (second) testimony &#8211; understanding, believing and accepting it firstly, and then applying it in the affairs of his life secondly. So our saying: “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger” requires, among other things, that we believe that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) conveyed the message and that he carried out his task in its complete and perfect form, such that no one that comes after him, however high or elevated he may be, can correct or amend some part of it. Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, indicated this fact in his saying: <strong> &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is authentically reported on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) from numerous paths of narration that he said: <strong>“I have not left anything that will bring you closer to Allaah and distance you from the Hellfire, except that I have commanded you with it. And I have not left anything that will bring you closer to the Hellfire and distance you from Allaah except that I have forbade you from it.” </strong>So there has not been left any room for amending anything from it, whether it be a simple or a trivial thing being amended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is reported on the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah (Madeenah), Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, which he deems is good, then he has claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has betrayed (the trust of conveying) the Message. Read the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic: &#8216;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8217; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah:3] So whatever was not (part of) the Religion on that day, is not (part of) the Religion on this day. And the last part of this ummah (nation) will not be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was from the understanding of Imaam Maalik, the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah, such that he plainly stated in a clear Arabic language that whoever introduces into Islaam just one innovation and then claims that it is something good, he has in fact claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) betrayed the Message. And whoever makes this claim, he does not believe (truly) that “Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” As is very clear in the words of this noble Imaam, it (the innovation) is “not (part of) the Religion on this day.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to implement his Ittibaa’ (following of the Prophet), such that he could be truthful in (his declaration that) Muhammad, Allaah’s Messenger, is His slave and messenger. And that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) brought the complete and pure message, without adding to it or subtracting from it. If this is the case, then every Muslim must acknowledge his extent and stop at the points where his Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has placed limits for him, such as the acts of worship and deeds of obedience (to Allaah). This is because the pen has dried with what was revealed previously (i.e. no more revelation after Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). And there was no room left open to approve of an act of worship that didn’t exist previously in the first days (i.e. of the Prophet). Consequently, our pious predecessors (Salaf As-Saalih) have come and gone all acknowledging the extent of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in that he first fulfilled his mission and conveyed the Message, as you know. And (second) that he was the best worshipper amongst Allaah’s worshippers and the most fearing of Allaah. So there is no room to correct him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the standpoint of legislating (revealed matters) into the Religion, as you have heard the ayah and Imaam Maailk’s comments about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Such that it can be claimed that there is someone who is a better worshipper and more worshipping (of Allaah) than Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever understands these two facts, which are related to one’s belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger, he will limit the worship he performs for Allaah to only that which has been reported on the Prophet (in the ahaadeeth). And he will not put any example or role model before him other than the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). Nor will he ever claim this second point, meaning it is impossible that it can get into the mind of any believer that he is more dutiful to Allaah or more fearing of Allaah or more worshipping of Allaah than him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is something impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention what has been reported in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik (raa) that a group of people went to see the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) but asked his wives because they were not able to find him. So they asked his wives about the Prophet’s worship – about his standing in prayer at night, his fasting during the day and about his relations with his wives. So they mentioned to them what they knew about his guidance regarding that &#8211; and his guidance is the best guidance on the face of this earth as is stated in the khutbah al-Haajah: <strong>“And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.”</strong> The wives of the Prophet mentioned to these men that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would fast and break his fast, and that he would pray at night and also sleep and that he would marry women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (raa) said: “When they heard that from the wives of the Prophet, they found his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) worship to be little.&#8221; They thought it to be little because of what had settled in their minds that the Prophet must pray the whole night and that he must fast all the time and that he was a monk and did not go near his wives. So they were shocked to find something that was not in compliance with their notions. So they assumed that the reason for this was because Allaah had forgiven all of the Prophet&#8217;s past and future sins. So it is as if they said: “The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) only minimized in his worship &#8211; which they thought to be little &#8211; because Allaah had forgiven his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there wasn&#8217;t left any obstacle preventing him from increasing in the worship of his Lord.” This was a mistake on their part without a doubt. This is since they didn’t know that this worship which they thought to be little, was in fact worship that could not be fulfilled by even the best worshipper amongst mankind, not even Dawood (as) about whom it is authentically reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong> “Dawood was the best worshipper amongst mankind.” </strong>This group of people did not know that the Prophet was the best worshipper amongst mankind with this worship (of his) and that not even the best worshipper amongst mankind was able to perform his worship, as I have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was from the things that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) was asked about when some people – who were well aware of his habits not like that group of people that was ignorant of his habits – found him, and they felt compassion for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), because they saw him standing in prayer until his feet had become swollen. So they said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins.” They meant by this: “Have pity on yourself, O Messenger of Allaah! Be easy in the worship, for your feet have become swollen.&#8221; And his response was: <strong> &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the false reasoning employed by that small band of people, who said the reason for the Prophet&#8217;s little worship was because Allaah had forgiven his past and future sins. They were not aware that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would stand in night prayer until his feet would become swollen. So when it was said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins”, he responded: &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basing on what they imagined was little worship on the part of the Prophet and what they knew of Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins, each person in this small group assumed that they were obligated to exceed in worship and that they must surpass what they heard about the Prophet&#8217;s worship with regard to his fasting, praying at night and relations with women. So they made the following pledges to themselves: The first person said &#8220;I will pray all night and won&#8217;t sleep.&#8221; The second one said: &#8220;As for me, I will fast all the time and never go a day without fasting.&#8221; And the third person said: &#8220;I will not marry women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why? Because they assumed that marriage was a distraction and turned one away from perfecting one&#8217;s worship to Allaah. But they did not know &#8211; and Allaah knows best but it seem to me that they were new (reverts) to Islaam who did not learn yet of the Commands and Rulings of Islaam &#8211; that marriage was itself worship, as is found in the famous hadeeth, when a group of poor people came to the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The people with much wealth and income have surpassed us &#8211; they pray like we pray, they fast like we fast, and they make Hajj like we make Hajj. And they give money in charity but we don&#8217;t give away anything in charity!&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Shall I not direct you to something, which if you do, you will surpass those in front of you and those behind you will never be able catch up to you (in reward), except for those who do the same as you?&#8221; So the representative of the poor people went back to his companions among the poor folk and related to them the good news that came from the Prophet. So they became very happy at hearing it. However, it was not long before their representative went to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger again to tell him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! What you told us was conveyed to the rich folk and so they have begun to do what we are doing.&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;That is the bounty of Allaah, which He gives to whom He pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the narration of Imaam Muslim found in his Saheeh. In another narration of the hadeeth, it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Verily in every tasbeehah (saying SubhanAllaah) there is charity for you. And in every tahmeedah (saying Al-Hamdulillaah) there is charity. And in every takbeerah (saying Allaahu Akbar) there is charity. And in every tahleelah (saying Bismillaah) there is charity. Commanding good is charity and forbidding evil is charity. And removing a harmful obstacle from the road is charity.&#8221; Then the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) continued to mention many noble characteristics. Then he said at the end of the hadeeth: <strong> &#8220;And in your having relations with your wife, there is charity.&#8221;</strong> They said in amazement: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, will one of us fulfill his desire (with his wife) and get rewarded for that?&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;Don’t you see that if one fulfills it in a forbidden way, that he will have a burden (of sin) for it?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So he said: <strong> &#8220;Then likewise, if he fulfills it in a lawful way he will be rewarded for it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were not aware of the likes of this hadeeth and other hadeeths in which there is found an incitement to get married and especially in producing children and progeny, as is reported in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;Marry the fertile and loving woman, for indeed I will compete with other nations by you, as regards to who has the most followers, on the Day of Judgement.&#8221; So the one who marries and keeps himself chaste and keeps his wife chaste, he will be rewarded for that. This group was ignorant about this, so there was one among them who made a pledge binding on himself that he would not marry, saying: &#8220;As for me, I will not marry women.&#8221; Then that group left and when the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) returned home, his wives informed him of what they heard from that group of people and the pledges they made to themselves. So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) gave a khutbah about this in his masjid, saying: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; (?) &#8211; repeating to the audience what these individuals who came to his house had said. &#8220;This last person will not marry women. The second said he would fast everyday and not go a day without fasting. And the other one said that he will pray all night and not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it was from the Prophet&#8217;s etiquettes when admonishing, reprimanding and teaching the people that he would hide the faults of those who committed errors or sinned (by not mentioning their names). So he would not expose them but rather make such statements like the one you just read above: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such?&#8221; This is because there is no benefit in mentioning the (name of the) person who erred, unless his error involves a large group of people and he is present (for the reminder). But if the people leave and he leaves, the opportunity for reminding them goes away. So in this situation, one must mention that to the people publicly. And it is not like that which is thought by some people who know about wisdom and gentleness when commanding good and forbidding evil, for they do not realize that gentleness does not nullify manifesting the criticism of one who errs if his error involves a group of people. The stories of our Salaf (predecessors), all praise be to Allaah, are filled with reports bearing witness to this fact. It is sufficient for me to just mention what the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) reported in their Saheehs from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, rady Allaahu &#8216;anhu, was giving the Friday khutbah &#8211; naturally in the Prophet&#8217;s masjid &#8211; when a man from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger entered &#8211; and in one narration it states that it was &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan. So &#8216;Umar stopped his khutbah and turned towards this person that had come late and had missed coming early to hear the dhikr and to hear the Jumu&#8217;ah khutah. So the man responded, saying: &#8216;O Commander of the Believers, I did not do anything except hear the Adhaan, make wudoo and then come to the masjid.&#8217; So he said to him reprimanding him in a disapproving interrogating manner: &#8216;The wudoo also, for I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: Whoever goes to (pray) Jumu&#8217;ah, then he should take ghusl (bath).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we derive from this report is that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) reprimanded &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan publicly in front of a large gathering of witnesses because he came late to the Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah and prayer. So therefore: The principle of teaching and reminding someone is based on the foundation of: Hiding the faults of people, unless there is a benefit that requires that it be done in public. This is the principle that the Messenger of Allaah implemented when he gave the khutbah regarding that group of people that had come to his house. So he said: &#8220;What is wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; making an indication of them but not naming anyone of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;As for me…&#8221;, which is a refutation of the essence of what was stated by those people who claimed the reason that the Prophet, had little worship was due to Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins. So he said: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast&#8221; &#8211; meaning I don&#8217;t fast all the time. &#8220;And I pray at night and I also sleep&#8221; &#8211; meaning I do not stay up the whole night, as is done by those extremists amongst worshippers who increase and try to surpass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is why &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said, as is recorded in Saheeh Muslim: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) never stayed up a whole night in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, reminding us that the Religion is moderation and that worhsip is moderation &#8211; neither exaggeration nor negligence: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast. And I pray at night and I also sleep. And I marry women. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah then he is not from me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as it came to us from Islaam, is that which all the Muslims are obligated to adhere to. And I guarantee that if Dawood, who was the best worshipper amongst mankind according to the testimony of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, came after the Prophet&#8217;s being sent with this complete and perfect Islaam, he would not be able to encompass doing all of the Prophet&#8217;s acts of worship. This means all of the acts of worship that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger brought whether through speech, actions or silent approval. Due to this, there remain no grounds for any Muslim to add an act of worship after Allaah completed His Religion by sending His Prophet with this perfect Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after realizing that the Prophet is the best worshipper amongst mankind and the most dutiful and fearing of Allaah amongst them, there should not be anything but following of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). We are upon certainty that we will never be able to encompass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, except for occasionally or at brief periods of time. So we are completely incapable of following and tracing the footsteps of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in his worship. This is impossible &#8211; with respect to every individual amongst mankind after the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there remains nothing before us except that we all strive for two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To learn the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in all matters that came to us from Islaam &#8211; whether in Creed or in Worship or in characteristics and manners. And as I said before, we will never be able to do more than just imitate him, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So imitate (them) if you are not like them,<br />
Verily, imitating the righteous ones is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not for us to imitate anyone amongst mankind except him, because he is the most perfect of humans according to unanimous agreement. And everyone that imitates him after he has gone will be overwhelmed by his ocean of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. This is the first thing &#8211; that we must know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger according to the wide and extensive meaning. This is since the Prophet&#8217;s saying concerning that group of people: &#8220;So whoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from me&#8221;, this sentence in this general hadeeth does not refer to the abandonment of the recommended sunnah acts, for example, that this person is not from the Prophet. This is not what is meant by the hadeeth. Rather, the meaning of the hadeeth is: &#8220;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah&#8221; meaning from my Way and from my Methodology in all affairs of my religious life. This is the kind of person that is not from him. And this kind of person varies with regard to his remoteness from following the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah has two meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A religious Arabic language-based one, and it is that which the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and those who followed his way were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which has occurred in the custom of the Fuqahaa in dividing the worship into two types &#8211; Fard (Obligation) and Sunnah (Recommended). The Sunnah here according to their definition of it is: &#8220;That which the one who does it will be rewarded for and which the one who abandons it will not be punished for.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person that abandons the Messenger&#8217;s Sunnah, with its first meaning &#8211; i.e. his way and methodology &#8211; then this person is in misguidance. And his deviance can either be large or little depending on his closeness or remoteness to following Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). So based on this, we should find ourselves as having no need for amending and introducing a &#8220;good innovation&#8221; (bid&#8217;ah hasanah) into Islaam, claiming that there is nothing wrong with this innovation. This is because we should find ourselves as falling short and being incapable of following the noble Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in everything that has been reported to us concerning his worship, whether it is related to supplications, remembrances or prayers. So it is sufficient for us to just follow him, according to our abilities. Here, I would like to mention a story reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh so that you can realize the worth of Allaah&#8217;s saying: ”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.” [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree reported that one of the Jewish Rabbis went to &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab during the time of his Khilaafah and said to him: &#8220;O Commander of the Believers! There is an ayah in the Book of Allaah that if it had been revealed unto us &#8211; a gathering of Jews &#8211; we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid (holiday).&#8221; So he asked: &#8220;Which ayah is it?&#8221; So the Rabbi mentioned the ayah: &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you…&#8221; So &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;This ayah was indeed revealed on a day of &#8216;Eid, on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah while the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was in &#8216;Arafaat (meaning in his farewell pilgrimage). So this ayah was indeed sent down on a very great day in which there is a combination of two virtues and two &#8216;Eids &#8211; the &#8216;Eid of Jumu&#8217;ah and the &#8216;Eid of &#8216;Arafaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did this Jew say: &#8220;Had it been revealed unto us, we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid?&#8221; It is because he was aware of the greatness of this blessing, which Allaah bestowed upon His servants. But what about us Muslims today? Unfortunately, we do not give this great blessing its due weight in worth. This is why you find many people in the past &#8211; in previous generations &#8211; who have filled the Muslims with prayers, words of remembrance and supplications that the Prophet did not come with. What has come to us from the Prophet is truly sufficient and adequate, in fact it is more than our human capabilities can grasp. However, each one of us takes from this worship what he is able to and what conforms to his capability and capacity.</p>

Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Etiquettes of a Student of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The student of knowledge must first know that Allaah has made it obligatory for him to worship Him, and worship cannot be attained except through knowledge. And he must know that it is not befitting for a Muslim to remain in ignorance. Thus, his search for knowledge is so that he may eradicate ignorance from himself and so that he may worship his Lord in the manner in which Allaah has commanded, not in the manner in which his desires deem appropriate. This should be his intention in his efforts for seeking knowledge, such that he has sincerity instilled in his heart, with regard to his exertion. He must not see any merit in his efforts, as belonging to himself, but rather he must see that all of the merit placed upon him, belongs to Allaah. This is because, with seeking knowledge, Allaah has granted him the means by which he may worship Him properly, by way of performing the obligations and abstaining from the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must avoid all affairs that cause him to draw his attention away from the objective (of knowledge), except for those things which he must involve himself with for needs sake. Allaah says: &#8220;Allaah has not placed two hearts in the body of a man.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Ahzaab: 3] And most importantly, whenever ones thoughts are divided, he is hindered from achieving the realization of his objectives. For this reason, it is said: &#8220;Knowledge will not give you part of itself, until you first give it all of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must also begin by cleansing his soul from reprehensible manners and reprehensible characteristics. This is since knowledge is an act of worship of the heart as well as a hidden link and concealed means of drawing nearer to Allaah. Thus in the same way that prayer, which is a duty upon the visible body’s limbs, is not valid, except by performing visible purification over the filth and uncleanness, hidden acts of worship as well as rectifying the heart with knowledge is not valid, except after purifying it from filthy manners and unclean characteristics. For this reason it is said: &#8220;The heart is purified through knowledge, just as the land is purified though tilling.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must not feel proud or arrogant about the knowledge he acquires. Rather, he must display humility in front of his teacher and grant him full control to direct and supervise him in all matters. He should submit himself willingly in the same way that a sick person, that is ignorant about medicine, submits himself to a concerned and proficient doctor. And if his teacher should be younger than him in age and possess little popularity and family status, then it is only by showing humility and patience with the degrading factors of knowledge, that one can truly attain the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Similarly, he must carefully select the person he is going to acquire knowledge from. He should not take knowledge, except from one whose qualifications are legitimately established, whose good religious qualities are evident, whose reputation is reliable and whose respectability is well known. Muhammad Ibn Sireen, Maalik Ibn Anas and many more of the Salaf have said: &#8220;Indeed, this knowledge is the Religion! So look carefully towards whom you take your Religion from.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must look towards his teacher with an eye of respect and reverence, for indeed this is the best way of deriving benefit from him. When some of our Salaf would go to study with their teacher, they would give something away in charity and say: &#8220;O Allaah, conceal my teacher’s defects from me and do not cause the blessing of his knowledge to be taken away from me.&#8221; Ar-Rabee&#8217;, the companion of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) would say: &#8220;I never dared to drink water in the presence of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, while he was looking at me, for fear of (upsetting) him.&#8221; And it is reported that some of the predecessors used to say: &#8220;From the rights that a teacher has over you is that: You should greet all the people generally with Salaam, but specify him apart from them with a particular greeting. You should sit in front facing him. You should not point toward his direction with your hand nor should you wink at him with your eye. You should not say to him: ‘Such and such person says the opposite of what you say!’ You must not backbite anyone in his presence. You should not consult your partner’s advice while in his gathering. You should not grab onto his garment if he should rise nor should you persistently bother him if he is fatigued. And you should not mind anyone that prolongs his company with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He should enter into the presence of his teacher with a clear and purified mind. Thus, his heart should be free of any matters that would prevent him from giving his full attention. He must not enter into his presence without first asking his permission, if his teacher is in a place which necessitates that his asking for permission be sought. He should greet those that attend his gathering with Salaam, when entering, and specify his teacher with a particularized greeting, apart from them. He should not step over the people with disregard, but rather he should sit where the rows of the gathering come to an end, until the teacher grants him permission to draw closer or he understands from the other students that are sitting that they prefer for him to advance. He should not cause anyone to get up from his place and if someone loves for him to sit in his place, then he should not accept, following the example of Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa). This is unless there is a benefit in his sitting up front, for the ones present, or the teacher orders them to do that. He should not sit in the middle of the learning circle, unless there is a necessity. He should not sit between two companions, unless he has their permission to do so. And if space is made for him in a gathering, he should sit and crouch himself in order to fit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must be polite with his teacher&#8217;s companions and those that attend his learning circle, for indeed, in doing that, he will be behaving well with the teacher and preserving the well being of the gathering. He should not raise his voice to loud tones nor should he laugh or talk too much, without any need for it. He should not fiddle with his fingers nor should he turn and peer to his right or to his left, unless he has a need to do so. Rather, he must face his teacher and devote his complete and undivided attention to his words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must safeguard and preserve his studies by being diligent and persisting in it during all times in which he has the ability to do so. He should not satisfy himself with a little when he has the ability to attain more. He should not over burden himself with things that he cannot handle, for fear that it will cause him to grow tired and postpone what he desires to attain (of knowledge). This matter varies according to each individual and his circumstances. He must exert himself severely in trying to make free time for himself, maintain vivacity and eagerness, develop a strong and healthy body, have observant and conscious mind and to possess few preoccupations, such as the obstacles that fall in one’s way when he becomes a leading figure or when he gets promoted to a high position. &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (raa) said: &#8220;Acquire knowledge before you become leaders. For indeed, when you become leaders, followed by the people, you will be prevented from acquiring knowledge, due to the elevation of your position and excessiveness of your preoccupations.&#8221; [Kitaab-ul-‘Ilm (The Book of Knowledge) of Abu Khaithama] This statement contains the meaning of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee&#8217;s words: &#8220;Acquire knowledge before you are given leadership, for when you become a leader, then there is no recourse for you, except knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Etiquettes of a Teacher</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The teacher must make his intention purely for the sake of Allaah when teaching. He should not use his knowledge to seek an honorable position in the society nor should he charge any fee in exchange for his knowledge. He should not prefer nearness to the rich and luxurious, whilst distancing himself away from the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must characterize himself with the good manners mentioned in the texts of the Revelation, as well as the praiseworthy qualities and the pleasant traits that Allaah has guided towards. This includes abstaining from the worldly life, possessing little of its luxuries and not being tested by it and its inhabitants. Other characteristics include generosity, kindness, polite manners, cheerfulness in the face, forbearance and patience. He must be void of being able to grant little benefit to others. He must observe the qualities of piety, humility, tranquility, respect and humbleness. He should refrain from laughing and joking too much. He must observe the prescribed duties of the Religion, such as trimming the mustache, clipping the fingernails, combing the beard and ceasing to have a bad attitude. He must adorn his outer and inner characteristics with the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). It has been reported on &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (raa) that he said: &#8220;Whosoever displays good characteristics to us, we will have good thoughts about him and love him. And whosoever displays bad characteristics to us, we will have bad thoughts about him and hate him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must free himself from performing any matters that have been ruled detestable (makrooh) as well as from indulging excessively in matters that have been ruled allowable (mubaah), while in the presence of his students. He should always have his students see him obeying Allaah and remembering Him much (dhikr), and he must preserve that condition. He must be cautious of all the dangers that are to be heeded, such as jealousy, showing-off, being amazed with oneself, and having contempt for others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The teacher must be gentle with the one who takes knowledge from him. He must welcome him graciously and be kind to him, according to that person&#8217;s state of being. He must always offer him sincere advice, for indeed, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;The Religion is sincerity (advising): to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must be gentle and compassionate with the one that seek knowledge from him, and he must look after his needs, just as he looks after the needs of his own child or his own self. He must be humble in the presence of those that frequently go to him and learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must preserve his habit of teaching students, causing that to have a significant place in his necessities. And when sitting amongst his students, he must rid himself of any affairs that cause him to become preoccupied. He must give to each one of his students, according to what is befitting to them, individually. Thus he should not exceed with one that doesn’t show that he wants to go a step further nor should he undercut from one that does want to progress. He should compliment anyone that shows excellence in his studies, as long as he doesn’t fear that affliction will befall him, by his becoming amazed with himself or something other than that. And he must show strictness with whoever deserves it, so long as he doesn&#8217;t fear that it will chase him away. He should not be jealous of any of his students, if one of them begins to display proficiency in the subject matter being studied. Nor should he continuously mention the favors that Allaah has bestowed on him, in that student&#8217;s presence. For indeed, being jealous of others is forbidden, upon a strict forbiddance. So how can he be jealous, especially of the student, who holds the status of a child?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Muslim At-Tirmidhee, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others. Ibn Al-Atheer (ra) said: &#8220;Naseeha (Sincerity/Advising) is a word that entails many meanings. It is the desiring of good for the one who is being advised. The meaning of sincerity to Allaah is possessing good beliefs in regards to His Oneness and sincerity of intention in His worship. Sincerity to the Book of Allaah means believing in it and acting upon what is contained within it. Sincerity to His Messenger means believing in his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prophethood and rendering obedience to what he has commanded and what he has forbidden. Sincerity to the Muslim leaders means obeying them in matters of truth and not setting out against them in rebellion, if they should be oppressive. And sincerity to Muslim common folk means advising and directing them towards their needs and benefits.</p>

Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: What is the ruling on television today?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: There is no doubt that television, today, is Haraam (forbidden). This is since television is like the radio and tape recorder – they are like all the other blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon His servants, as He has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you were to count the blessings of Allaah, you would never be able to count them.&#8221; [Surah An-Nahl: 18]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, hearing is a blessing and eyesight is a blessing, and so are the lips and the tongue. However, many of these blessings become trials upon their possessors because they do not use them in a way that Allaah loves and wants for them to be used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I consider the radio, television and the tape recorder to be from the blessings of Allaah, but when are they deemed as blessings? When they are used to bring benefit to the ummah. Today, ninety-nine percent of what is on television is evil, licentious, immoral, forbidden, and so on, while one percent of it has some shows presented that are of benefit to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the consideration is with regard to the majority (and not the minority). So when a true Muslim state exists that can place programs based on knowledge, which would be beneficial for the ummah, at that point I will not say that television is permissible, but rather I will say that it is obligatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">There are three levels of fasting, the general fast, the specific fast and the more specific fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">As for <strong>the general fast</strong>, then it is the refraining of ones stomach and their private parts from fulfilling their desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><strong>The specific fast</strong> is the refraining of ones gaze, tongue, hands, feet, hearing and eyes, as well as the rest of his body parts from committing sinful acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">As for <strong>the more specific fast</strong>, then it is the heart’s abstention from its yearning after the worldly affairs and the thoughts which distance one away from Allaah, as well as its (the heart’s) abstention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">From all the things that Allaah has placed on the same level. [5]</p>
<p align="justify">From the characteristics of the specific fast is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>one lowers his gaze and safeguards his tongue from the repulsive speech</strong></span> that is forbidden, disliked, or which has no benefit, as well as controlling the rest of his body parts. . In a <em>hadeeth</em> by al-Bukhaaree:</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="color:#008000;">‘‘Whosoever does not abandon false speech and the acting upon it, Allaah is not in need off his food and drink.’’</span> [6]</p>
<p align="justify">Another characteristic of the specific fast is that one <strong><span style="color:#000000;">does not overfill himself with food during the night.</span> </strong>Instead, he eats in due measure, for indeed, the son of Aadam does not fill a vessel more evil than his stomach. If he were to eat his fill during the first part of the night, he would not make good use of himself for the remainder of the night. In the same way, if he eats to his fill for <em>suhoor</em>, he does make good use of himself until the afternoon. This is because excessive eating breads laziness and lethargy therefore, the objective of fasting disappears due to one&#8217;s excessiveness in eating, for what is indeed intended by the fast, is that one savours the taste of hunger and becomes an abandoner of desires.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="color:#993300;">References</span>:</p>
<p align="justify">[5] (Editors note: Additional comment is required here, The levels mentioned are levels of abstinence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The <strong>first of these three levels</strong> entails the <strong>abstinence which is fulfilled</strong>, the fast is considered complete in view of the one having met the legislated requirements [i.e. It does not have to be repeated or made up, the servant has indeed fasted.] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The <strong>remaining levels</strong> deal with the <strong>value of the Fast</strong>. If the second is level is not met, the fast will be of less value to the servant, than if it were met and likewise for the third. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Thus it is said that intentional eating and intercourse render the fast null and void, whereas committing other unlawful acts such, likes speaking falsely, placing the unlawful look to the opposite sex and so on will constitute a sin of one degree or another, but not nullify the fast.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee<br />
Translated and Arranged by: Isma&#8217;eel Alarcon [<em> Al-Asaalah</em> , Issue #4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can we make a combination between the report<strong> &#8220;with His left Hand&#8221;</strong> , mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, in<em> Saheeh Muslim</em> and his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-handed?&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between the two hadeeths that is apparent on the outset. Thus his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-handed&#8221;</strong> is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-</strong> <strong>Seer.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this description, which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has informed us of is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s removal from any anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, the hand of Allaah is not like the hand of a human being – left-handed and right-handed. On the contrary,<em> both</em> His hands are right-handed, may He be far removed from any defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other point, then it is that the report:<strong> &#8220;with His left hand&#8221;</strong> is<em> shaadh</em> ,<em> [12] </em> as I have clarified in the checking of &#8220;<em> Al-Mustalahaat-ul-Arba&#8217;ah Al-Waaridah feel-Qur&#8217;aan</em> &#8221; (no. 1) of Al-Mawdoodee. What further supports this is that Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth and (in it, he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ) said,<strong> &#8220;with His other hand&#8221;</strong> in the place of<strong> &#8220;with His left hand.&#8221;</strong> This report is in conformity with his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, other saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-</strong> <strong>handed.&#8221;</strong> And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12 ] Translator&#8217;s Note: A<em> shaadh</em> hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by a reliable narrator, which contradicts (the report  of) a narrator that is more trustworthy than him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Prayer: is a link between the servant and his Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p>The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Indeed, when one of you prays, he speaks privately with his Lord</strong></span>.&#8221; [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p>And Allaah says in the qudsee hadeeth: &#8220;I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two parts, and My servant will have what he asks for.</p>
<p>So when the servant says: ‘Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabb-il-‘Alameen’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has praised Me.’</p>
<p>And when he says: ‘Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has extolled Me.’</p>
<p>And when he says: ‘Maaliki-yawm-id-Deen’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has honored Me.’</p>
<p>And when he says: ‘Iyyaaka Na’bdu wa Iyyaaka Nasta’een’, Allaah says: ‘This is between Me and My servant and My servant will have what he asks for.’</p>
<p>And when he says: ‘Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem. Siraat-aladheena an’amta ‘alaihim. Ghairil-Maghdoobi ‘alaihim wa lad-Daalleen’, Allaah says: ‘This is for My servant and for My servant will be what he asks for.’&#8221; [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Prayer:</strong> is a garden of ‘ibaadaat (acts of worship), in which every splendid type of worship is found.</span></p>
<p>There is the takbeer, by which the prayer is initiated,<br />
the standing in which the person praying recites the words of Allaah,<br />
the bowing in which he extols his Lord,<br />
the rising from the bowing position, which is filled with the praising of Allaah,<br />
the prostration in which he glorifies Allaah by His highness and in which he implores him through supplication,<br />
the sitting in which there is the tashahhud and (more) supplication and the closing with tasleem.</p>
