<p><strong>Sighting the new moon:</strong></p>



<p>اللهُ أَكْبَر، اللّهُمَّ أَهِلَّهُ عَلَيْنا بِالأمْنِ وَالإيمان، والسَّلامَةِ والإسْلام، وَالتَّوْفيقِ لِما تُحِبُّ رَبَّنا وَتَرْضى، رَبُّنا وَرَبُّكَ الله</p>

<p>Abee Zayd al-Qayrawaanee, (the Imam famous well known as, Malik As-Sagheer) (May Allah have mercy on him) says:</p>



<p><strong>“The narrations of morals and manners have been combined into four narrations”</strong></p>



<p>The Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“Whoever believes in Allah and the last day then let him say (a word that is) good or be silent.”</strong></p>



<p>And the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“From the goodness of a person’s Islam is that he leaves off that which does not concern him.”</strong></p>



<p>Also, the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said to the one who sought advice from him: <br /><strong>“Do not become angry!”</strong></p>



<p>Likewise, the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“None of you (truly) believes until he loves for his brother, what he loves for himself.”</strong></p>



<p>Hence, these four narrations- are all from forty hadeeth of the narrations regarding morals and manners-collected by Imam Nawawee (May Allah be pleased with him).</p>

<p><strong>Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen<br />Chapter 191 &#8211; The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1066. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform Salat (prayer) in his house. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “<strong>Do you hear the Adhan (call to prayer)?</strong>” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then directed him to respond to it. [Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1067. Abdullah bin Umm Maktum, the Mu’adhdhin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): “<strong>There are many poisonous insects and wild beasts in Al-Madinah, and I am blind. Please grant me permission to perform Salat at home</strong>.” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired whether he could hear the call: Hayyaalas-Salah; Hayya `alal-Falah (Come to the prayer, come to the salvation). When he replied in affirmative, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed him to come (to mosque) for prayer.” [Abu Dawud].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1068. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, “<strong>By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I sometimes thought of giving orders for firewood to be collected, then for proclaiming the Adhan for Salat. Then I would appoint an Imam to lead Salat, and then go to the houses of those who do not come to perform Salat in congregation, and set fire to their houses on them</strong>.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1069. Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: &#8220;<strong>He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (i.e., on the Day of Requital) as a Muslim, should take care and observe the Salat when the Adhan is announced for them. Allah has expounded to your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the ways of right guidance, and these (the prayers) are part of the right guidance. If you have to perform Salat in your houses, as this man who stays away (from the mosque) and performs Salat in his house, you will abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and the departure from the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) will lead you astray. I have seen the time when no one stayed behind except a well-known hypocrite. I also saw that a man was brought swaying (on account of weakness) between two men till he was set up in a row (in the mosque)</strong>.&#8221; [Muslim].</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Exerting Efforts Towards Accomplishing Sincere Righteous Actions</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another cause for the increase and strengthening of eemaan is for the Muslim to exert efforts towards enacting sincere righteous actions for the countenance of Allaah; he should try to do more (good) deeds and to do them on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because for every action that Allaah has legislated, which the Muslim undertakes and with which he makes his intention behind it sincere, it increases him in eemaan, since eemaan increases because of obedience and ample acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the servitude that Allaah has enjoined on His slaves and demanded them to enact, the obligatory and voluntary of them, are distributed among the heart, the tongue and the limbs. Each of them has a servitude specific to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the servitude of the heart that are specific to it are sincerity, love, <em>tawakkul</em>, <em>inaabah</em>, hope, fear, reverence, awe, contentment, patience and other actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of servitude of the tongue that are specific to it are reading the Qur&#8217;aan, <em>takbeer</em>, <em>tasbeeh</em>, <em>tahleel</em>, seeking forgiveness, praising and commending Allaah, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger and other actions that can only be done by the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the servitude of the limbs that are specific to it, examples of this are <em>sadaqah</em>, hajj, prayer, ablution, proceeding towards the mosque and other such actions that are only possible with the use of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these actions of the heart as well as those of the tongue and the limbs are all from eemaan and are inherently present within the true meaning of the word eemaan. To perform such actions and to increase in them will therefore result in an increase of eemaan and to neglect them and to lessen the performance of them will result in a deficiency of eemaan.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>i. Actions of the Heart</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, actions of the heart are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the</strong> <strong>foundation of the religion</strong></span>. They are its uppermost part and the most important of ordinances. In fact, apparent [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., actions of the limbs and tongue, which are sensed. [t]</span>] actions are not accepted if they are void of any actions of the heart; the reason being that the acceptance of all actions are stipulated by sincerity to Allaah and sincerity is an action of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why actions of the heart are mandatory upon everyone and the abandonment of such actions can never be deemed praiseworthy under any condition whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are of three levels with regard to the accomplishment of these actions, similar to the case with actions of the body: one who oppresses his own self, one who suffices with that which is obligatory and one who chases after the good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is imperative of every Muslim that he starts with the purification and rectification of his heart and with having concern for it, before he concentrates with the rectification of his exterior, as no consideration is given to the rectification of the outer whilst the inner is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, when the Muslim does rectify his heart with purifying actions, sincerity, truthfulness and love for Allaah and His Messenger, his limbs will turn upright as in the hadeeth of an-Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Basheer that is recorded in the two Saheehs. He said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; say: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; Indeed, and within the body is a morsel of flesh; if it is sound, then the whole body will be sound and if it is corrupt, then the whole body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree. (1/127 Fath) and Muslim, 3/1220]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth contains the greatest indication that the rectification of the slave&#8217;s outer movements is directly connected to the rectification of the activity of his heart and inner soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If his heart is pure, there being only love of Allaah, love of that which Allaah loves, fear of Him and of falling into that which He hates, the movements of his limbs will all become sound. This is in sharp contrast to a corrupt heart which is conquered by a love for desires, chasing lusts and placing the wants of the self first. Whoever is in such a predicament, the movements of his limbs will all be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, it is said that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the heart is the king of the limbs</strong> </span>and that the rest of the limbs are its soldiers. In addition to this, the limbs are an obedient army to the heart; they race to its obedience and towards the execution of its commands, not opposing it in any matter whatsoever. Thus, if the king is righteous, this army will be a righteous one. If on the other hand, the king is corrupt, the army will, because of this resemblance, also be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only the heart that is pure is of benefit before Allaah, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#003300;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except for the one who comes to Allaah with a pure heart</span>.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):88-89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pure heart is the one that is free of all diseases, blights and distasteful matters. It is the heart that contains nothing but love of Allaah, fear of Him and fear of anything that will distance him from Allaah. [<span style="color:#999999;">See Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam of Ibn Rajab, page 71</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;<strong>Moreover, the heart is the foundation. If it embodies knowledge and intention, this will take effect on the body without fail. It is not possible for the body to play truant to what the heart desires&#8230; so if the heart is righteous as a result of its knowledge and action on eemaan, this absolutely necessitates the rectification of the body in apparent speech and action in accordance with complete eemaan</strong>.&#8221; [al-Fataawaa, 7/187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, for one to endeavor to fully fight his self in rectifying his heart and to fill it with love of Allaah and of statements and actions that Allaah loves, is one of the most formidable ways in which one increases his outer and inner eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab says: &#8220;<strong>&#8230;the heart cannot be rectified unless there settles within it knowledge of Allaah, His greatness, love of Him, fear and awe of Him, hope and <em>tawakkul</em> in Him and for it to be overflowing with this. This is the reality of tawheed and the meaning of&#8217; none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there can be no question for the rectification of the hearts until its deity, which it worships, knows, loves and fears is one deity, having no partner. If there were in the heavens and the earth a deity being worshipped other than Allaah, the heavens and earth would as a result become corrupt, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Had there been therein </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., the heavens and earth) </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">deities besides Allaah, then for sure both would have been ruined&#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa&#8217; (21):22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One concludes from this that righteousness cannot be attained by the celestial and earthly worlds until the activity of its inhabitants are made all for Allaah. The movement of the body is dependent on the activity of the heart and its intention. If therefore, the heart&#8217;s movement and desire are for Allaah alone, it will become sound and all the movements of the body will become sound. If, however, the movement and intent of the heart are for other than Allaah, it will become corrupt and the activity of the body will also become corrupt in accordance to the (level of) corruption within the activity of the heart.&#8221; [Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 71. See al-Waabil as-Sayyib of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authenticated on the Prophet that he said: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever loves for Allaah, hates for Allaah, gives for Allaah and withholds for Allaah has indeed perfected eemaan</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i> [Related by Aboo Daawood, 4/220, at-Tabaraanee in al-Kabeer, number 7737, Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah, 2/658 and others. Al-Albaanee declared it saheeh, see as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, 1/658]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The meaning of this is that with all the motions of the heart and limbs, if they are all for Allaah, the eemaan of the servant, both the interior and exterior, will be complete and the goodness of the activity of the heart necessitate goodness of the activity of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if the heart is good, there being only desire of Allaah and of that which He desires, the limbs will only proceed towards that which Allaah desires. Consequently, the limbs hasten towards that which incurs the pleasure of Allaah, they refrain from what Allaah dislikes or what is feared that would be disliked by Allaah even if it is not sure of that.&#8217; [Jaami&#8217; al &#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the hearts become righteous with eemaan, truthfulness, sincerity and love and no desire for other than Allaah is left in the heart, all the limbs will attain righteousness and they will not move except for Allaah and only in areas that His pleasure will be attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the heart is always occupied in thought, either about its essential afterlife and its betterment, or about the welfare of its worldly life and living, or its thoughts center on misgivings, false aspirations and hypothetical circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sum and substance of the rectification of the heart is that you occupy it with thoughts on that which constitute its welfare and true and actual success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, in the area of knowledge and conceptions, one occupies it with knowledge of what binds one of <em>Tawheed</em> and its rights, of death and what leads on from it up until entering Paradise and Hellfire and of the ill actions and the ways to protect oneself from committing them. In the area of intentions and resolutions, one occupies it with desires of that which will cause one benefit and to reject desires that which will bring harm upon him. [See al-Fawaa&#8217;id of ibn al-Qayyim, page 310 and 311]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, of immense assistance to the servant in this regard is to increase the beneficial observations, which are enacted in the heart, so that his attachment with Allaah strengthens, as the existence of righteous actions is associated to the establishment and great number of these observations in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong></span>, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;We will by the aid and tawfeeq granted by Allaah, point out these observations in a manner that will make known the reality of this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first observation of the traveler to Allaah and the home of the hereafter</strong></span>, is that there exists in his heart an observation of this world and its insignificance, its trivial fulfillment, extensive futility, vile participants and rapid demise&#8230; Thus, if the servant undertakes this observation of the world, his heart will migrate from this world and it will travel to seek the home of the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this moment, an observation of the hereafter and its continuity is enacted in his heart. That it is in all truth, <b>the real life</b>. Its inhabitants will never migrate or depart from it. Rather, it is the place of settling, the last stopping point of all travelers and the end of the journey&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">an observation of the Fire is made in his heart</span></strong>, of its combustion, blaze and the depth of its pit; its intense heat and the immense torment of its inhabitants. He observes them as they are brought forth to it with blackened faces, blue eyed with iron chains and fetters around their necks. When they reach the fire, its doors will be opened in front of their faces and they will witness that abominable sight, whereupon their hearts will be become severed out of regret and sorrow&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if this observation is accomplished in the heart of the servant, he will be stripped of sins, disobedience and of following desires and will instead don the guise of fear and caution&#8230; How distant he will actually be from disobedience and violations is dependent on the strength of this observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This observation will melt away, roast through and expel the destructive remnants and elements within his heart and thereupon, the heart will find the sweetness of well being and its pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>an observation of Paradise is established in the heart</strong></span> and of what Allaah has prepared in it for its inhabitants: things that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no imagination of has ever been made within the heart of a person. This is besides the detailed types of bliss Allaah has portrayed to His servants upon the tongue of His Messenger, guaranteeing the loftiest types of pleasure concerning foods, drink, clothes, palaces, delight and happiness. So, enacted in his heart is an observation of an abode, within which Allaah has placed everlasting bliss in its entirety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its ground is musk and its pebbles are pearls. Its structure is made up of bricks of gold and silver and of pearly embroidery. Its drink is sweeter than honey, possesses a fragrance more pleasant than musk, is cooler than camphor and tastier than ginger. In relation to its women, if the face of one of them were to be revealed to this world, it would overpower the radiance of the sun. The clothes of the inhabitants are made of the silk of sarsenet and brocades. Their servants are youths looking like scattered pearls. Their fruit will be everlasting, whose season is not limited and supply not cut off Therein are thrones raised high. Their food is the flesh of the fowls they desire. They will have drink of wine, there being no harmful effect within it and they will not suffer intoxication. Their vegetation is the fruit that they desire. Their view will be of fair females possessing wide lovely eyes like preserved pearls. They will be reclining upon thrones and in that Garden being made happy. In it are what the souls covet, what gratifies the eyes and they will abide in it forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one adds to this observation, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">the observation of the day of Mazeed</span></strong> &#8220;&#8230; looking at the face of the Lord and listening to His speech without an intermediary&#8230; If this observation is attached to the ones before it, there and then, will the heart race towards its Lord faster than the procession of the wind moving in its direction and the heart will not on its way bother to glance, neither left nor right&#8230;&#8221; [Madaarij as-Saalikeen, 3/250-252]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if such observations are manifested in the heart of the servant and he contemplates over them, it will be of great help towards the purification of his heart and its eradication of denounced characteristics and ignoble desires and towards the evacuation of any attachment to other than Allaah. Furthermore, it will be a great motive for worship, love, fear, repentance and of feeling in need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent here is to highlight that one of the greatest incentives for eemaan, one of its most beneficial consolidators and most important reasons for its increase and development is the rectification of the heart through eemaan, love of Allaah, His Messenger, of that which Allaah and His Messenger love and to purify it from anything that opposes or nullifies this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who grants tawfeeq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8230; لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* i.e., the day of increase. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;aan: <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Yoonus (10):26]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says, <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">There </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., Jannah)</span><b><span style="color:#000000;">, they will have all that they desire, and We have more</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Qaaf (50):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Husnaa</em> has been explained to mean <em>Jannah</em> and &#8216;more&#8217; to mean seeing Allaah. This is attested to by the hadeeth recorded in Saheeh Muslim and Sunan at-Tirmidhee and related by Suhayb ar-Roomee, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;</i><strong><span style="color:#000000;">When the people of <em>Jannah</em> enter <em>Jannah</em>, Allaah will say ‘Would you like something I con increase you with?’ They will reply, ‘Have you not whitened our faces? Have you not admitted us into <em>jannah</em> and saved us from the Fire?’</span></strong><i>&#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than seeing their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span> In a similar narration, the end reads: &#8220;The Prophet then recited this aayah: <span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [t]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>ii. Actions of the Tongue</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for actions of the tongue like the remembrance of Allaah, praising and commending Him, reading His Book, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger, ordering the good, forbidding the evil, <em>tasbeeh</em>, seeking forgiveness, supplication and other actions that are performed by use of the tongue, without doubt, performing such actions, on a regular basis and often is one of the greatest causes for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>One of the causes that procures eemaan is to greater the remembrance of Allaah at all times and to also supplicate much, which is the core of worship</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allaah implants the tree of eemaan in the heart. It nourishes and develops it. The more the servant increases in his remembrance of Allaah, the stronger his eemaan will become.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as eemaan calls to much remembrance, whoever loves Allaah will mention Him much. [As the saying goes: &#8220;Whoever loves something, increases in his mention of it&#8221; [t]] Indeed, love of Allaah is eemaan, or rather, it is its spirit.&#8221; [Al-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, pg. 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim mentions in his book al-Waabil as-Sayyib that remembrance has a hundred benefits. He listed seventy-three of these benefits [See al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pg. 84 and onwards], such as that remembrance repels Shaytaan. It pleases the Most Beneficent, causes depression and anxiety to disappear and brings joy and happiness. It strengthens the heart and body, illuminates the face and heart, brings about sustenance and many other tremendous benefits that he mentioned, may Allaah have mercy upon him, which are attained because of the remembrance of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, the greatest and most beneficial benefit in the remembrance of Allaah is the fact that it increases eemaan, strengthens it and stabilizes it. Accordingly, a number of texts are related &#8216;in the Book and Sunnah, which command and encourage the remembrance of Allaah. They beckon for its increase and show its excellence and importance. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and remember Allaah much so that you may succeed</span>.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Jumu&#8217;ah (62):10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالذَّاكِرِينَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَالذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and (for) men and women who remember Allaah much, Allaah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab (33):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, the believers are none other than those whom when Allaah is mentioned, their hearts tremble with fear…</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; Verily, it is in the remembrance of Allaah that the hearts (truly) attain tranquility</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As recorded in Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah was on his way to Makkah when he passed by a mountain known as jumdaan. He said, <i>&#8216;Travel through, this is Jumdaan: the mufarridoon have excelled.’ </i>Someone asked, &#8216;Who are the mufarridoon O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, <i>&#8216;Men and women who remember Allaah much.&#8217;</i>&#8221; [Muslim, 4/2062]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Dardaa&#8217;, may Allaah be pleased with him, relates the Prophet saying: <i>&#8220;Should I not inform you of the best of your deeds, the most sanctifying of them before your Lord and which does more to raise your status with Him. (A deed,) that is better for you than the disbursement of gold and money, or battle with the enemy whereby you strike at their necks and they strike at yours?&#8221;</i> They said: &#8220;What is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He replied: <i>&#8220;Remembrance of Allaah.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Related by Ahmad, 5/195; Ibn Maajah, 2/1245; at-Tirmidhee, 5/459; at-Tabaraanee in ad-Du&#8217;aa&#8217;, 3/1636; al-Haakim, 1/496; Aboo Nu&#8217;aym in al-Hilya, 2/12; al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 5/10 and al-Mundhiree mentioned it in at-Targheeb wa at-Tarheeb, 2/395 via many chains from Ziyaad Ibn Abee Ziyaad from Abee Bahriyyah from Aboo Dardaa&#8217; from the Prophet. Al-Haakim declared: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr states: &#8220;This is related with a connection to the Prophet via chains that are good,&#8221; Al-Baghawee and al-Mundharee declared its chain of narration to be hasan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Ibn Busr mentioned that a man said to the Prophet : &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the rites of eemaan are much for me, so tell me of something that I might hold fast to.&#8221; He answered: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let not your tongue cease from the remembrance of Allaah</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>[Related by Ibn Abee Shaybah, 10/301 &amp; 13/458; at-Tirmidhee, 5/458; Ibn Maajah, 2/1246 and al-Haakim, 1/495. At-Tirmidhee declared: &#8220;The hadeeth is hasan ghareeb.&#8221; Al-Haakim said: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Al-Albaanee mentioned in his checking of al-Kalim at-Tayyib, page 25: &#8220;Its chain of narration is Saheeh&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recorded in the Saheehayn is the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he reports the Messenger of Allaah as saying: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah says, ‘Indeed I am as My servant presumes Me to be and I am with him when he remembers Me. So if he remembers Me to himself I remember him to Myself and if he remembers Me amongst a company, I remember him amongst a company that is better than them &#8230;</strong></span><i>&#8220;</i> [Al-Bukhaaree, (13/384 with Fath) and Muslim, 4/2061] Many other texts are likewise indicative of the excellence and importance of remembrance and of the virtue of engaging in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if a person turns away from all of this and does not engage his tongue with remembrance of Allaah, his tongue will be engrossed with matters besides it such as backbiting, slander, mockery, lies and obscene language. This is because the slave cannot but speak. Thus, if he does not speak with the remembrance of Allaah and of His commands, he will speak of these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim says: &#8220;For the tongue does not keep quiet at all. It is either a tongue that remembers or a tongue that is frivolous and it has to be one of these two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the (nature of the) soul; if you do not preoccupy it with truth, it will occupy you with falsehood. It is the (nature of the) heart; if you do not accommodate it with love of Allaah, it will dwell with love of creation and this is a certain reality. It is the (nature of the) tongue, if you do not preoccupy it with remembrance, it will most definitely occupy you with frivolity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, choose for your own self one of the two courses and confer upon it one of the two standings.&#8221; [Al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pages 166- 167 and also see page 87]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>iii. Actions of the Limbs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the heart like prayer, fasting, hajj, sadaqah, jihaad and other acts of obedience, they are also reasons for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To exert efforts therefore, towards enacting acts of obedience, which Allaah has made incumbent upon His slaves and performing acts that achieve nearness (to Allaah), which Allaah has recommended His servants to undertake and to accomplish these acts in a proficient and complete manner, is one of the most tremendous causes behind the strengthening and increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَاةِ فَاعِلُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَاعُونَ  </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Successful indeed are the believers: those who offer their prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness; who turn away from al-Laghw; who pay the zakaah; who guard their chastity, except from their wives or those that their right hands possess, for them, they are free from blame. However, whoever seeks beyond that, then they are the transgressors; those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat and covenants and those who strictly guard their prayers. These are indeed the inheritors, who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall abide therein forever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):1-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These precious qualities, each one of them profits and develops eemaan. They are also characteristics of eemaan and fall under its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the attendance of the heart in prayer and the event of the praying person striving with his self to call to mind and heart what he is saying and doing, such as recitation, remembrance, supplication, standing, sitting, bowing and prostration, are reasons for the increase and development of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah named prayer &#8216;eemaan&#8217; when He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and Allaah would never cause your eemaan</span></b><span style="color:#000000;"> [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., the prayers that were performed towards the direction of Jerusalem, before the commandment of changing the qiblah to the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah. [t]</span>]</span><b><span style="color:#000000;"> to be lost &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, concerning the statement of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8230; إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ ۗ وَلَذِكْرُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and establish the prayer. Verily, the prayer prevents from all obscenities and evil deeds. And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ankaboot (29):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is the greatest obstructer of every obscene and evil deed that negates eemaan. In addition, prayer also embodies the remembrance of Allaah, which nourishes and develops eemaan because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <em>zakaah</em> also nurtures and increases eemaan, (both) the obligatory type of <em>zakaah</em> and its recommended type, as the Prophet has said, <i>&#8220;… and sadaqah is proof.&#8221;</i> i.e., a proof for the eemaan of its giver. Hence, it is evidence of eemaan and it nourishes and develops it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, to avert from <em>al-Laghw</em>, which is any speech or action that is void of good. Instead they (i.e., the believers) speak and do well, and abandon evil in both speech and action. This is without doubt, from eemaan and eemaan increases and profits from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why whenever the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and those after them sensed heedlessness or their eemaan was in disarray, they would say to each other, ‘Sit with us so that we may have eemaan for an hour’. So they would remember Allaah and remember his religious and worldly favors causing their eemaan to renew itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, abstaining from forbidden and indecent acts, especially, the obscenity of fornication, this is definitely a great sign for eemaan. The believer, because of the fear he has concerning his standing in front of his Lord, he:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">نَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ &#8230;</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah an-Naazi&#8217;aat (79):40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… in response to the necessity of eemaan and to nourish what he already possesses of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, observing trusts and contracts and preserving them is from the signs of eemaan and related in a hadeeth: <i>&#8220;… and there is no eemaan for the one who is not trustworthy.&#8221;</i> [Related by Ahmad, 3/135; Ibn Abee Shaybah in both his Musannaf, 11/11 and al-Eemaan, pg.5; Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, (1/208 al-Ihsaan) and al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 1 /75. Al-Baghawee declared, &#8220;This is a hasan hadeeth&#8221; It was declared saheeh by al-Albaanee in his tahqeeq of al-Eemaan by Ibn Abee Shaybah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you would like to know of the eemaan and religion of a slave, then inspect his condition: does he fulfill all of his trusts and contracts, the verbal and financial or trusts concerning rights? Does he observe the rights, covenants and oaths, the ones between himself and Allaah or those between himself and his fellow servants? If the answer is in the positive then he is a person of religion and eemaan. If however that is not the case, his religion and eemaan will be deficient in accordance to the level of his infringement of these obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ended these <em>aayaat</em> with the issue of safeguarding the prayers with respect to their limits, rights and times. This is because preservation of this, is of similar standing to the water that flows around the garden of eemaan. So it irrigates it, nurtures it and produces its crop upon every occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree of eemaan is in need of constant irrigation at all times; this irrigation is the maintenance of acts of obedience and worship of the day and night. It also demands the obliteration of anything that harms it, such as alien and harmful rocks and growths; this is in reference to the abstention from unlawful matters in both speech and action. Whenever these undertakings are accomplished, this garden will witness its geese and it will produce its assorted crop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of this clarification, the strong effect of righteous actions on the increase of eemaan has become clear to us. It is also clear that the performance and increase of these acts are a tremendous cause for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;The perfection of eemaan is in enacting the commands of Allaah and His Messenger and refraining from the prohibitions of Allaah and His Messenger. Consequently, if one does not perform certain commandments and replaces them by embarking on certain prohibitions; this will result in a proportional decrease of eemaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, prayer is eemaan, hajj is eemaan, sadaqah is eemaan, jihaad is eemaan and all the actions that Allaah has ordered His slaves with are eemaan. If the servant does these acts his eemaan will increase and the performance of these actions will be a cause for the increase of his eemaan, on the condition of sincerity and adherence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, states: &#8220;The increase of eemaan has causes, some of these are: performing acts of obedience because eemaan increases in proportion to the fineness, type and abundance of the action. Thus the finer the action the greater will be the increase of eemaan; the fine aspect of the action is determined by the degree of sincerity and adherence. As for the type of action, the obligatory type is better than the recommended and some forms of worship are more emphasized and virtuous than others; the more virtuous the act of obedience is the greater will be the resultant increase in eemaan. As for the abundance of the action, then eemaan increases as a result of it because action is from eemaan, so it is not surprising that eemaan increases because of an increase of the action.&#8221; [Fath Rabb al-Bariyyah, pg. 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, other great righteous actions that increase eemaan, which have not yet been mentioned are da&#8217;wah to Allaah and keeping company with virtuous people. Because of the importance and great benefit of these two matters in the increase of eemaan, its discussion is imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for da&#8217;wah to Allaah and to His religion, consulting each other with the truth and patience, calling to the fundamentals of the religion, to the adherence of its laws by way of ordering the good and forbidding the evil and sincerely advising the Muslims, this is all from the incentives and causes for eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, the servant perfects himself and others, as Allaah has sworn by time, [Refer to Soorah al-&#8216;Asr (103). [t]] that the whole genus of humans are in a state of loss except for the one who is categorized with four qualities: eemaan and righteous actions, which both constitute the perfection of the self (thirdly) mutual consultation with the truth, which is beneficial knowledge, righteous action and the true religion and (fourthly) mutual consultation with patience in all of this, and with these (last) two, others are perfected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because da&#8217;wah to Allaah itself and advising His servants are amongst the greatest fortifiers of eemaan. The person involved in da&#8217;wah has to work to aid this da&#8217;wah and establish the proofs and evidences for its realization. He has to undertake matters from their proper channels and approach issues from their rightful paths. These issues are from the ways and channels of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam states: &#8220;The reason for the presence of eemaan and its constituents sometimes traces back to the servant (himself) and at other times back to others, for example, one is destined to interact with someone who invites him to eemaan, orders him with good and forbids him from evil. He explains to him the signs of the religion, its proofs and evidences. He shows him what to consider, what befalls him, what to take heed from. In addition (to this), there are many other reasons.&#8221; [Al-Fataawa, 7/650]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the reward is always from the same class as the action. So, just as the person strives to perfect his fellow servants, advises them, consults them with truth and to be patience in all this, Allaah will most definitely compensate him with rewards similar to his actions. Allaah will assist him with a light and spirit from Him and with strength of eemaan and tawakkul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan and strong tawakkul on Allaah bring about victory over the enemies of the devils of men and jinn as Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, he </b>(i.e., Shaytaan)<b> has no power over those who have eemaan and put their trust solely on their Lord.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, this person is also occupied with aiding the truth and whoever turns to undertake something, then he will most definitely be granted certain triumphs in knowledge and eemaan according to his truthfulness and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who commands the good and forbids the evil must therefore remain adherent to truthfulness and sincerity when commanding and forbidding in order for it to bear fruit and produce pure eemaan in him as well as those whom he is propagating to. He must also observe wisdom and leniency when inviting, be patient with those whom he is calling and to have knowledge of that which he is calling them to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these features are realized within him, his da’wah will bear fruit and benefit by the will of Allaah and it will be a cause for the strengthening of his eemaan and of those whom he is calling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for keeping company with virtuous people, clinging to them, accompanying them and coveting to benefit from them, this is a great cause for the increase of eemaan. The reason being that these type of gatherings embody reminder of Allaah, fear of Him and His punishment, targheeb, tarheeb and other matters, which are of the greatest of causes towards the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَكِّرْ فَإِنَّ الذِّكْرَىٰ تَنفَعُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;And remind, for indeed, reminding benefits the believers&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَىٰ سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰ وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الْأَشْقَى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Therefore, remind, in case the reminder benefits; those who fear will remember and the wretched will avoid it.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):9-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that possessors of believing hearts benefit greatly from reminders and from being in congregations of remembrance. It provokes activity and resolution within them and obligates profit and elevation. This is in stark contrast to gatherings of frivolity and foolishness, for these are immense reasons for the decrease and fading away of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this effect, our righteous predecessors were the most concerned with gatherings of remembrance and the most distant from meetings of frivolity and foolishness. Many of their statements that indicate this have preceded, like the accounts of &#8216;Umayr Ibn Habeeb al-Khatmee and Mu&#8217;aadh Ibn Jabal, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another cause, with which I will end the discussion on these causes, which one must pay attention to and not neglect. The Muslim has to train and adapt himself to fight everything that causes a decrease, weakness or disappearance of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Since, in relation to eemaan, just as one must enact all the causes that strengthen and develop eemaan, then likewise, in addition to this, one must repel the preventive matters and obstacles (towards the attainment and increase of eemaan). Repelling these are accomplished by the abandonment of disobedience; being repentant of the disobedience one does commit; safeguarding the limbs from the unlawful issues and opposing the trials and afflictions of misconceptions that weaken the desires of eemaan, which are in essence, the desire and love for good. Endeavoring after this can only be accomplished by abandoning desires that (would otherwise) negate those desires (of eemaan), such as desire of the soul for evil and by opposing the soul that constantly commands evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the servant preserves himself from falling into the trials and tribulations of misconceptions and desires, his eemaan will become complete and his certainty will become strong.&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan of Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, page 37]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>v. Reading the Life-Histories of the Salaf of this Ummah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf of this ummah: the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and their students and successors in righteousness, people of the first period of Islaam, are the best of all generations. They are the defenders of Islaam, guides for humankind and lions of combat. They are the participants of the great and momentous incidents and events and the bearers and transmitters of this religion to all who came after them. They have the strongest eemaan amongst the people, they are the most well grounded in knowledge, have the most pious of hearts and the purest of souls. The specifically chosen amongst them are the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -, whom Allaah favored with the sight of His Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -. He gratified them by granting them sight of his guise and honored them by allowing them to hear his voice and listen to his speech. They received the religion from him in a fresh and new manner, it took root in their hearts, their souls found tranquility with it and they remained firm on it on par with the stability of the mountains. It suffices as a representation of their excellence that Allaah addressed them with His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;You are the best people ever raised up for mankind&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan (3): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is, you are the best of all peoples and the most beneficial for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; said: <i>&#8220;The best of my ummah, is the generation that I have been sent in, then those who proceed after them &#8230;&#8221;</i>[Muslim, 4/1964. It is also related in both Saheehs by &#8216;Imraan ibn Husayn with the following wording: <i>&#8216;The best of my ummah is my generation, then those who proceed them&#8230;&#8217; </i>al-Bukhaaree, (7/3 Fath) and Muslim, 4/1964]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who studies the condition of these righteous people, reads their biographies, perceives their sublime qualities and virtues and reflects on what they were upon, such as the tremendous character and mannerisms they had; their adherence to the noble Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -; their preservation over eemaan, fear of sins and disobedience; wariness of riyaa&#8217; and hypocrisy; their responsiveness to obedience; vying in performance of good deeds; their aversion to this transitory world and dedication to the everlasting Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who does this, will come across during this contemplation and study, a number of fine qualities and numerous characteristics and attributes that attract him towards a truthful impersonation of them and a desire to adorn oneself with their qualities. Mention of them, reminds of Allaah and contemplation over their condition, strengthens eemaan and cleanses the heart. Fine indeed, is the verse of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Relate again their tale to me, 0 caravan leader for their tale polishes the very thirsty heart.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The areas for the study and refection on the biographies of these righteous people are the books of Taareekh (History), as-Siyar (Biographies), az-Zuhd (asceticism), or-Raqaa&#8217;iq (heart-softening narratives), al-War&#8217; (piety) and others. One benefits from those of the reports that have been authenticated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contemplation and study produces fine imitation of them as Shaykh al-Islaam writes: <strong>&#8220;Whoever resembles them more, it will be a greater perfection in himself.&#8221;</strong> Furthermore, whoever resembles a people, becomes one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these aforementioned issues increase eemaan and strengthen it. They are issues that are classified under the beneficial knowledge derived from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and that which the Salaf of this ummah were upon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The World and its Allurements</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second external factor, which bears effect on a person&#8217;s eemaan by decreasing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, one of the causes of the decrease and weakness of eemaan is to be engrossed with the transient things of this temporary worldly life; to occupy one&#8217;s time with it; be devoted to seeking it and to race after its pleasures, temptations and seductions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the servants longing for this world intensifies and his heart becomes attached to it, his obedience will weaken and his eemaan will decrease accordingly. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The extent of the servants desire for the world and of his pleasure with it determines his slackness towards obedience of Allaah and seeking the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></span> [al-Fawaa&#8217;id, pg. 180]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, Allaah, the Wise, the All-Aware, censured the world in His Book and made clear its vileness and wretchedness in many aayaat in the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ ۖ كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَاهُ مُصْفَرًّا ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَامًا ۖ وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانٌ ۚ وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children, just like the vegetation after rain, which pleases the tillers; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter there is a severe torment</b> (for the disbelievers, evil-doers)<b>, and there is forgiveness from Allaah and </b>(His)<b> Good Pleasure </b>(for the believers, good-doers)<b>, whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hadeed (57):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ الرِّيَاحُ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا الْمَالُ وَالْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And put forward to them the example of the life of this world, it is like the water </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(rain)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">,which We send down from the sky. The vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(later)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds then scatter. And Allaah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the everlasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord, for rewards and better in respect of hope&#8221;</span></b>[Soorah al-Kahf (18):45-46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَفَرِحُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَاعٌ &#8230;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter is but a brief passing enjoyment&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا وَرَضُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاطْمَأَنُّوا بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا غَافِلُونَ أُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمُ النَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world, and those who are heedless of Our Aayaat </b>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)<b>. Those, their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains the greatest warning to one who is pleased with the life of this world, is comforted by it, is heedless of the aayaat of Allaah and who does not hope to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Allaah says in censuring those of the believers who are pleased with this world:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of Allaah </b>(i.e., Jihaad)<b> you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah at-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but l fear that the world will be spread out for you just as it was spread out for those before you and then you will compete for it just as they competed for it and then you will be destroyed just as they were destroyed.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is agreed upon [i.e., both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim relate it. [t]. Al-Bukhaaree, (6/258, 7/320 Fath) and Muslim, 4/2273 from the hadeeth of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, may Allaah be pleased with him]. In another wording of theirs, <i>&#8220;… you will be distracted just as they were distracted.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other such texts, which are great in number. Thus, one who wants his eemaan to have growth, strength, safety from weakness and decrement must strive against his soul in distancing himself from this world, its temptations, seductions and distracting amusements, and what a multitude they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can only be achieved and become true after considering two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> to consider and look at the world, its rapid termination, passing away and disappearance; its deficiency and vileness; the pains of competing against one another for it and coveting it and what this contains of agony, embitterment and adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The end of all that will be disappearance and discontinuance along with the regret and sorrow that follows on from it. Thus, its seeker can never be free of anxiety and worry before he attains it or even when he actually achieves it and he can never be free of grief and distress after it passes on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The second:</span></strong> to consider and look at the Hereafter and its approach and arrival that is inevitable; its perpetuity and eternity; the glory of what it is within it of blessings and joy; the disparity between such things and what is in this world. It is as Allaah said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are blessings that are perfect and everlasting, whereas these (things of the world) are fantasies that are deficient, sporadic and transitory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one contemplates over these two matters and considers them and looks into them in a proper manner, this will direct him to prefer the Everlasting Hereafter to the transient world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest aid for him in fulfilling this is to take a look at the state of Messenger and his biography as well as his Companions. The fact that they renounced the world, turned their hearts away from it and discarded it. They never accustomed themselves with it and instead deserted it. They never inclined towards it and they regarded it to be a prison and not a heaven and thus, abstained from it in a true manner and if they had desired it they would have acquired every loved thing and arrived at every cherished matter from it. Indeed, the keys to the treasures of the world were offered to the Prophet but he rejected them. The world also poured out to the Companions but they did not opt for it and did not exchange their portion of the Hereafter for the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew that the world was a crossing point and passageway not a place of dwelling and settling, that it was a place of transit (&#8216;<em>uboor</em>) and not a place of happiness (<em>suroor</em>) and that it was a summer cloud which will soon disperse and an apparition no sooner is it completed than is it on the brink of departure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَاهُمْ سِنِينَ  ثُمَّ جَاءَهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُوعَدُونَ مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُمَتَّعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Tell Me, if We do let them enjoy for a number of years, then afterwards comes to them that </b>(punishment) <b>which they had been promised; all that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):205-207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِّنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day when He shall gather </b>(resurrect)<b> them together, </b>(it will be as if)<b> they had not stayed </b>(in the life of this world and graves, etc.)<b> but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُوا غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَانُوا يُؤْفَكُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the <em>Mujrimoon</em> </b>(criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.)<b> will swear that they stayed not but an hour…&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Room (30):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who is beseeched to aid us with eemaan and to protect us from trials and temptations, the apparent and hidden.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest branches of knowledge that can lead to the increase, stability and strengthening of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has revealed His lucid Book to His servants as a source of guidance; mercy, light and glad tidings and as a remembrance for those who remember.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Qaaf (50):37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These noble aayaat contain mention of the excellence of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, the Book of the Lord of the Worlds. The fact that Allaah made it blessed and a guidance for the worlds. He placed within it a cure for illnesses, especially, the illnesses and diseases of misconceptions and desires of the heart. He made it a source of glad tidings and mercy for the worlds and as a form of remembrance for those who remember. He made it a guide towards that which is most just and upright, and He mentioned aayaat and threats by which they may fear or would cause them to remember and reflect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, one who reads the Qur&#8217;aan, and ponders and reflects over its aayaat finds within it such knowledge and learning, which strengthen, increase and develop his eemaan. This is because he will come across within the discourse of the Qur&#8217;aan, a King, who possesses all dominion, for whom alone, is all praise. The reigns of all affairs are in His hand alone, they emanate from Him and return to Him. He has ascended above His throne and not a single secret in the regions of His dominion escapes Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is aware of what is in the souls of His slaves, fully cognizant of their hidden and public deeds. Solely, He disposes of the affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He hears and sees, gives and withholds, rewards and punishes, and honors and abases. He creates and sustains, and gives life and causes death. He decrees, executes and disposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites His servants and directs them towards what constitutes their happiness and success. He entices them towards this, and warns them of what will cause their ruin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He introduces Himself to them by His names and attributes. He woos them with His favors and blessings and reminds them of His favors upon them. He commands them with what entitles them to the completion of such favors and blessings and warns them of His vengeance. He reminds them of the honor He has prepared for them if they obey Him, and of the punishment He has prepared for them if they disobey Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informs them of how He handles His awliyaa&#8217; and His enemies, and of the outcome of both. He praises His awliyaa&#8217; for their righteous actions and fine qualities. He censures His enemies for their bad deeds and distasteful characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He puts forward parables and provides numerous types of proofs and truths. He replies to the misconceptions of His enemies with the finest of answers. He gives credit to the truthful and denies the liar. He speaks the truth and guides towards the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites to the abode of peace and safety (i.e., Paradise). He mentions its description, its beauty and its bliss. He warns against the abode of destruction (i.e., the Hellfire re). He mentions its torment, its ugliness and its pains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He reminds His slaves of their necessity towards Him, their dire need of Him, and that they can never be independent of Him ever for the blink of an eyelid. He informs them that He can dispense of them and of all creation, and that He Himself is the Rich and is not dependent on anything, whereas, everything besides Him is inherently in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He makes known to them, that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of good except by His Favor and Mercy, and that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of bad except by His justice and wisdom. One witnesses from His speech, His reproach of His beloved in the most gracious of ways and despite that, He dismisses their mistakes and forgives their slips. He accredits their excuses, rectifies their corruption, defends and protects them. He is their victor, their guardian over their welfare and the one who delivers them from all difficulties. He is the One who will keep His promise to them, He is their only patron and protector. He is their true patron and protector and their victor over their enemies. How fire a patron and victor He is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the servant never ceases to benefit from reflecting on the Book of Allaah. His heart bears witness to such types of knowledge that increase his eemaan and strengthen it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this not be so? When he finds within the Qur&#8217;aan, a King who is glorious, merciful, generous and beautiful; this is His standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can he not love Him, compete to attain a nearness to Him or use up his energy in trying to show love for Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can He not be more beloved to him than anything else? How can he not prefer His pleasure to anyone else&#8217;s pleasure?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he not be attached to His remembrance? How can his love for Him, his desire to meet Him and feeling close to Him not be his nourishment, strength and medicine, in that if he were to be bereft of this, he would become corrupt and ruined and would not benefit from his life? [Refer to al-Fawaa&#8217;id of Ibn al-Qayyim, pages 58-60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Aajurree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;Whoever contemplates His words, will know the Lord and he will know of His great power and capability, His immense favor upon the believers, and of the obligation upon himself to worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the person imposes this duty upon himself thereby being on his guard against that which his Generous Patron and Protector has warned of and coveting that which He has made desirous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is of this description when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it when recited by another, the Qur&#8217;aan will be a cure for him. He becomes rich without money, he attains power and strength without kinsfolk and finds intimacy in that which others feel alienation towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His desire when opening a Soorah for recitation will be, ‘when will I accede to the admonition contained within what I recite?&#8217; and his desire will not be, ‘when will I complete this Soorah?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His aspiration is none other than, &#8216;When will I understand what Allaah is addressing me with? When will I restrain (from committing sins)? When will I take heed?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is worship and it is not to be done so in a state of heedlessness, and Allaah is the one who grants the tawfeeq towards that?&#8221; [Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, by al-Aajurree, page 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah, the Generous, orders His servants and encourages them to ponder over the Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; (4):82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan, or are there locks upon their hearts?&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah Muhammad (47):24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah proclaims that He only revealed the Qur&#8217;aan so that its <em>aayaat</em> would be pondered over, He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(This is a) Book that We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its aayaat, and that those of understanding may remember.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Saad (38):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also explains that the reason behind the lack of guidance for the one who deviates from the straight path is his disregard for reflecting on the Qur&#8217;aan and being too proud to listen to it, He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ كَانَتْ آيَاتِي تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَامِرًا تَهْجُرُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَاءَهُم مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ آبَاءَهُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, My aayaat used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels. With haughtiness, you talked evil about it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) throughout the night. Have they not then pondered over the Word (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):66-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions of the Qur&#8217;aan that it increases the believers in eemaan if they read it and contemplate on its aayaat, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;The believers are none other than those whose hearts feel fear when Allaah is mentioned. When His aayaat are recited to them, they (i.e., the aayaat) increase them in their eemaan and upon their Lord (alone), they rely.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah relates about the righteous amongst the Ahl al-Kitaab, that when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited to them they fall upon their faces in humble prostration and in a state of weeping, and that it increases them in humility, eemaan and submission. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ آمِنُوا بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُؤْمِنُوا ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَا إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Say, &#8216;Believe in it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in humble prostration, and they say:&#8221; How perfect is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord will be fulfilled:&#8217; They fall upon their faces weeping and it adds to their humility.&#8221; </b></span>[Soorah al-Israa&#8217; (17): 107- 109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also informs that if He were to send down the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan upon a mountain, it would humble itself and rupture because of the fear of Allaah. He made this as a parable for the people to demonstrate to them the greatness of the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعًا مُّتَصَدِّعًا مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;aan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder out of fear of Allaah. Such are the parables that We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hashr (59):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described the Qur&#8217;aan as being the best of speech, parts of it resembling other parts and He repeated some of it so that it would be understood. He mentioned that the skins of the righteous shiver in fear and hope when they hear the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَابًا مُّتَشَابِهًا مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has sent down the best speech, a Book, its parts resembling each other in goodness and truth, oft repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Thereafter, their skin and hearts soften to the remembrance of Allaah. That is the guidance of Allaah. He guides with it whom He pleases and whomever Allaah sends astray, has no guide whatsoever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah az-Zumar (39):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah censures the believers for their lack of humility when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan and He cautions them to not resemble the disbelievers in this regard. He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَلَا يَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۖ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to be affected by Allaah&#8217;s reminder </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) </span><b><span style="color:#008000;">and of the truth that has been revealed, and not to be like those who had been given the Book before, whereby the term was lengthened for them and their hearts became hard and many of them are rebellious.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Hadeed (57): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aforementioned aayaat contain the clearest indication of the importance of the Qur&#8217;aan, the required attention that has to be paid to it, its powerful effect upon the hearts, and that it is the greatest matter that increases eemaan, especially, if the recitation is performed upon contemplation, reflection and on trying to understand its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;In short, there is nothing more beneficial for the heart than reading the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection. The Qur&#8217;aan encompasses all the levels of the travelers, the conditions of the workers, and stations of those possessing knowledge. It is the Qur&#8217;aan that generates love, desire, fear, hope, repentance, reliance, pleasure, entrustment, gratitude, patience and the rest of the different states that are life to the heart and perfection of it. Likewise, it repels all the rebuked characteristics and actions that cause the corruption and ruin of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If people were to possess a realization of what recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation contains, they would devote themselves to it at the expense of anything else. When the person reads it with reflection and he comes across an aayah that he is in need of, for the cure of his heart, he repeats it, even if he does so a hundred times or the whole night. Hence, to recite a single aayah of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection is better than reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to completion without any contemplation or reflection. It is also more beneficial for the heart and more conducive to attaining eemaan and tasting the sweetness of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8230;</strong></span>&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aaadah, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Rasheed Ridaa states: &#8220;Know that strength of religion and culmination of eemaan and certainty does not come about except by reading the Qur&#8217;aan very often and listening to it upon contemplation with the intention of being guided by it and to act on its commands and prohibitions. The correct and submissive eemaan increases, strengthens, develops and its effects such as righteous actions and abandonment of disobedience and corruption, all arise in pro-portion to the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan. It also decreases and weakens in proportion to not contemplating on the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the Arabs only believed when they heard the Qur&#8217;aan and understood it. They did not conquer the lands, inhabit cities, nor did their population grow and their power become greater except because of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8217;s effective guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the nobles of Makkah who opposed and stood in enmity, strove against the Prophet and tried to prevent him from conveying the message of his Lord by stopping him from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to the people:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَسْمَعُوا لِهَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ وَالْغَوْا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And those who disbelieve say, &#8216;Do not listen to this Qur&#8217;aan and make noise in the midst of it (being recited) so that you may overcome …</span>&#8216;&#8221;</b> [Soorah Fussilat (41):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The weakness of Islaam since the Middle ages up to the point where most of its empire disappeared is only so because of the abandonment of the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan, of reciting it and acting by it.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Tafseer al-Manaar, 3/170]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the Noble Qur&#8217;aan is one of the greatest fortifiers of eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It increases the eemaan of the slave in many diverse ways. Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee says: &#8220;It increases it in many ways. Indeed, as for the believer, by simply reciting the aayaat of Allaah and becoming acquainted with the truthful information and fine rulings present within it, he attains an abundant goodness from the affairs of eemaan. How will it then be if he contemplates on it proficiently and understands its aims and secrets?&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan li Shajarah al-Eemaan, Page 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, one must know that the increase of eemaan that arises from the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan does not happen unless one concentrates on understanding the Qur&#8217;aan, applying it and acting by it. The case is not that he simply reads it without understanding or contemplation, as many people who read the Qur&#8217;aan will find it to be their adversary and opponent on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been affirmed on the Prophet &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; that he said: <i>&#8220;Verily, Allaah raises up a people with this Book and He abases others.&#8221;</i> [Related by Muslim, 1/559] It has also been affirmed that he (- sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam -) said: <i>&#8220;&#8230; and the Qur’aan is either a proof for you or against you.&#8221; </i>[Related by Muslim, 1/203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a proof for you and it increases your eemaan if you act by it or it is a proof against you and it decreases your eemaan if you neglect it and do not observe its boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah stated: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a single person sits down with this Qur&#8217;aan except that he then rises with either some increase or decrease.&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 272, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 73, al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 77 of the concise version. Al-Baghawee mentioned it in his Tafseer, 3/133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree says in clarifying the meaning of contemplating the Qur&#8217;aan: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230; However, by Allaah, it is not by memorizing its letters and neglecting its boundaries. To the extent that one of them says, ‘I recited the whole Qur&#8217;aan and did not miss out a single letter!’ and by Allaah, he missed out the whole of the Qur&#8217;aan: no Qur&#8217;aan is seen in his character or deeds! To the point that one of them says, ‘Verily I can recite a Soorah with a single breath!’ By Allaah, these are not recites or scholars, they are not wise or pious. Whenever the recites are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq in his Musannaf 3/363, Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 274, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 41, and al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 76 of the concise version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon al-Hasan. I wonder as to what he would say if he witnessed the recites of our present time? Recites, who have been infatuated with being melodious, with correctly pronouncing the letters and flowering them, whilst they squander and neglect the limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, the ears of the people when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan, also turn to the pronunciation of the words and the melody whilst neglecting to hearken or to contemplate on the word of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In any case, there is no objection whatsoever to the tajweed of the Qur&#8217;aan, to recite it slowly and melodiously, and to render it in a fine way. The objection however, is in over burdening oneself and being obstinate in pronouncing the letters without paying any regard or attention to establishing the commands that were the reason for the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan. To the extent that you do not see in many of them the fear brought about by the limits of Allaah, indeed, nor do you see within them application of the Qur&#8217;aan in character or deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find a reciter amongst them, who has memorized the Qur&#8217;aan and who correctly pronounces the letters, shaving his beard or lengthening his lower garment. In fact, he may neglect performing prayer in its totality or in congregation, and other such sinful acts, to the extent that one of them &#8211; and Allaah&#8217;s help is sought &#8211; opened a music party for an immoral woman with aayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He recited as an introduction to her singing, aayaat from the Noble Qur&#8217;aan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The speech of our Lord is too great to be dishonored by the likes of such. It suffices me to repeat what al-Hasan, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, &#8216;Whenever the reciters are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee mentioned, when describing the reciters of his time being preoccupied with reciting the words of the Qur&#8217;aan accurately while neglecting its rulings, and taking it up as a profession when the Qur&#8217;aan was only revealed to be acted by: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;&#8230; but when this recitation became a profession, they beautified it and vied with it, spent their life &#8211; without any need for them &#8211; on it. One of them dies and he was able to raise the Qur&#8217;aan in speech as a pot is raised but he broke its meanings as a vessel is broken. Thus, he was not consistent with any of its meanings.&#8221;</span></strong> [Al-&#8216;Awaasim min al-Qawaasim 2/486,within the book Aaraa&#8217; Abee Bakr Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee al-Kalaamiyyah by &#8216;Ammaar at-Taalibee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslim must learn how to derive benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan before he begins to recite it in order for its benefit to be achieved. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentioned in this respect a principle that is of great standing and enormous benefit. It is, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;if you want to attain benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan, bring your heart together upon reciting or listening to it, and divert your hearing to it, and be present in front of it, in the manner of one who is present and spoken to by the One who spoke it, How perfect He is&#8221; </strong></span>[Al-Fawaa&#8217;id, page 5. Also, refer to al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah, I 6/48-51 and 7/236-237]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever applies this principle and traverses upon this methodology when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it, will succeed with both knowledge and action. His eemaan will increase and it will establish itself like towering mountains, and Allaah is the One who is asked to give us the tawfeeq towards that and every good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, contemplation and reflection over the aayaat of Allaah are of two types: &#8220;Contemplation over it to arrive at the intended meaning of the Lord and contemplation over the meanings of what Allaah called His servants to reflect on. The first is contemplation over the Qur&#8217;aanic evidence and the second is contemplation over the witnessed evidence. The first is contemplation over His aayaat that are heard (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) and the second is contemplation over His aayaat that are witnessed (i.e., the universe and what it contains).&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aadah, page 204] This was stated by lbn al-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion mentioned here centers on the contemplation of Allaah&#8217;s aayaat that are heard. As for reflection on His aayaat that are  seen and witnessed, discussion on this will follow shortly by the will of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Reflecting on the Universal Signs (Aayaat Kawniyyah) of Allaah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For certain, contemplating over these signs, studying the diverse and amazing creations of Allaah such as the sky, the earth, the sun, the moon, planets and stars, night and day, mountains and trees, rivers and oceans and the many other creations of Allaah that cannot be enumerated, is without doubt one of the greatest causes for eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its fortification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate the creation of the sky, look back up at it time after time. See how it is the greatest sign in its elevation and height, and in its extent and stationeries, whereby it does not climb up like fire or fall descending like a heavy object. It has no pillars and is neither connected from above. Rather, it is held by the might of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, contemplate its evenness and levelness, there is no rift, split or fissure within it. It does not have any curvature or crookedness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then consider the color it has been given, which is the best of colors, the most agreeable to one&#8217;s sight and that which strengthens it the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the creation of the earth and at its construction. You will notice that it is one of the greatest signs of its Maker and Originator. Allaah created it as a resting place and a bed. He made it subservient to His slaves. Allaah placed within it their livelihood and nourishment. He laid down pathways so that they may wander about the land in search for their needs and disposals. He established the earth firmly with mountains, making them pegs, protecting the earth from shaking along with its inhabitants and He expanded its sides and spread it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He extended the earth, spread it out and enlarged it from all its sides. He made it a receptacle for the living, containing them from above as long as they are alive and He made it a receptacle for the dead, containing them from underneath when they die. Thus, its outer is a homeland for the living and its inner is a homeland for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter look at it when it is dead, barren and humbled. When Allaah sends down the rains upon it, it stirs and grows. Thus, it rises and turns green and produces every type of lovely growth. It brings forth wondrous vegetation in appearance and sensation, which are delightful to the onlookers and amicable to the feasters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider how Allaah has perfected the sides of the earth with mountains that are unshakeable, towering, stern and solid. Consider how He has erected them so perfectly. How he elevated them and made them the most solid parts of the earth, so that they would not dwindle away with the stretch of years and continual succession of rain and wind. Rather, He perfected its creation, fortified its foundation and deposited within them such benefits, metals, minerals and springs, of which He desired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now ponder on this delicate and fine air that is held captive between the sky and earth. It is sensed through feeling when blown; its substance is felt and its form cannot be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It runs between the sky and earth and the birds circle and fly in it, swimming with the aid of their wings just as the fish of the sea swim in water. Its sides and ripples collide against each other when in commotion just as the waves of the ocean clash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider how Allaah forms with this wind, clouds that are held between the sky and earth. The wind excites the clouds causing them to rise and become dense, Allaah then combines them together and merges them. The winds then impregnate it; these winds are those that Allaah named <em>lawaaqih</em>, (i.e., impregnators [Refer to <em>Soorah al-Hijr</em> (15):22]). Allaah then drives it by the wind to the land in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it rises and ascends above the land, its water falls upon it. Allaah dispatches the winds whilst the clouds are in the atmosphere; the winds scatter and separate the clouds so that they do not harm or destroy something if the water were to descend upon it in its entirety. Once the land takes its fill and need, the clouds leave off the land and disperse. Thus, these clouds water the earth and are carried by the winds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider these oceans surrounding the land regions, which are gulfs of one great sea of water surrounding the whole earth such that even the lands, mountains and cities that are visible, are in relation to the water, like a small island in a massive ocean. The rest of the earth is submerged in water. If the Lord did not hold it with His power and will and if He did not hold back the water, it would overflow onto the lands and rise above it all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate on the night and day; they are amongst the most amazing signs of Allaah. See how He made the night for resting and as a covering. It coats the world causing the cessation of activities. Animals retire to their dwellings and the birds to their nests. The souls relax and take rest from the pains of their labor and tiredness until when the souls are reposed and have taken sleep and now look forward to their livelihood and its disposal, the Splitter of the morning (Allaah) brings forward the day, His army giving glad tidings of the morning. It vanquishes that darkness and tears it asunder, unveiling the darkness from the world, thereafter, the inhabitants are able to see. The animals then circulate about the land and proceed to manage their livelihood and welfare and the birds depart from their nests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a returning and arising, which is so indicative of the capability of Allaah towards the major return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the condition of the sun and moon when rising and setting to establish the state of night and day. If it were not for the rising of the sun and moon, the affair of this world would become inoperative. How would the people attend to their livelihood and dispose of their affairs whilst the world upon them is dark? How would they take pleasure in their life with the absence of light? So:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَاجًا وَقَمَرًا مُّنِيرًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Blessed be He who has placed in the heaven huge stars and has placed therein a great lamp (i.e., the sun) and a moon giving light. He is the one who placed the night and day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Furqaan (25):61-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examine the creation of the animals, with all their diverse characteristics, species, forms, usefulness, colors and endowed marvels. Some of them walk upon their bellies, some on two legs and some on four. Some of them have feet as weapons in the form of claws; some have beaks as weapons, like the eagle, vulture and the crow. Others have teeth as weapons and yet others have horns as weapons for use in defense of themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect and take heed in general from the setting of this world, the formation of its parts and the excellence of its arrangement and order, proving most cogently the perfection of the capability of its Creator and the perfection of His knowledge, wisdom, benevolence and delicateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do reflect on the world, you will notice it to be like a house that has been built and prepared with all of its apparatus, interests and all that it is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the sky is its roof that is hoisted above it. The land is its bed; it is a mat, bedding and an abode for the occupant. The sun and moon are two lamps that shine within it. The stars are lights, an adornment and guide for those who move about along the paths of this house. Gems and minerals are stored within it, like the provisions and storehouses that have been prepared and set; each and every thing of it is for its own specific purpose and use that befits it. All kinds of vegetation have been prepared for the purposes of the house. Varieties of animals have been laid out for its welfare, for mounting; providing milk; nourishment; clothing; enjoyment; employment and keeping guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the human being has been declared as the king, being commissioned with all of this. He is the one who rules and disposes by his actions and commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within all this, is the greatest sign and strongest proof of the Creator, the All-knowing, the Wise and fully cognizant, who has set proper measure and order for his creation in the finest way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, reflect and take heed in particular, from Allaah&#8217;s creation of yourself, O person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider the start, middle and end of your creation. Look with all insight at the beginning of your creation, from a trickle of dirty despised fluid; whereby the Lord of all lords extracted this fluid from between the back-bone and ribs, guided it by His might with the narrowness of its channels and the diversity of its passages up until Allaah brings it to its abode and place of assembly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">See how Allaah united the male and female and placed love between them and how He led them with the chain of desire and love to come together, which is the cause behind the synthesis and formation of a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how He predestined those two fluids despite the distance apart from each person. He brought them from the depth of veins and organs and gathered them to one place. He prescribed for them a firmly established dwelling. Air cannot get to it to spoil it; cold cannot get to it to harden or congeal it and no accidentals extend to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then transforms that white saturated trickle into a red clinging-like substance (that resembles a leech), which inclines towards a black color. Allaah then makes it into a chewed lump (of flesh) completely different to the clinging-like substance in its color, essence and form. Allaah then fashions it into bare bones without any clothing, which is contrary to the chewed lump in form, look, proportion, feel and color and so on, the stages of a person&#8217;s creation make a gradual process up until he emerges upon these forms that Allaah has fashioned him with; He originated for him, hearing, sight, a mouth, nose and the rest of the openings. He extended and spread out his legs and arms and separated their ends into fingers and toes and then further split them into phalanxes. He also assembled the inner organs such as the heart, stomach, liver, spleen, lungs, womb, intestines; each one has a proportion and benefit specific to it, so how perfect is, the One Who created (everything) and then proportioned (each thing appropriately) and Who measured and guided, Who said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَفِي أَنفُسِكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And also in your own selves, will you not then see?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All of creation, from the atom to the Throne, are connected pathways to acquiring knowledge of Allaah and are profound evidences pointing to His eternality. The Universe, in totality, is made up of tongues uttering the oneness of Allaah. The world, in its entirety, is a book, of which the letters of its particulars are read by the discerning, all according to the level of their insights.&#8221; [See Dhayl Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah of Ibn Rajab, 1/307. This is a saying of &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn Marzooq al-Qurashee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, reflect on these and other signs, which Allaah has created within the Heavens and earth. Contemplation, close examination and meditation on these signs yield immense benefits in the strengthening and steadfastness of one&#8217;s eemaan, because he apprehends through these signs, the oneness of his King and Creator and His perfection. Consequently, his love, glorification and veneration of Allaah will increase as will his obedience, submission and humbleness before Him. These are amongst the greatest benefits resulting from this reflection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you consider what Allaah has invited His servants to reflect on in His Book, it will impart you with knowledge of Allaah, of his oneness, His attributes of perfection and qualities of magnificence such as the extensiveness of His capability and knowledge and the perfection of His wisdom, mercy, benevolence, kindness, compassion, justice, pleasure, anger, reward and punishment. Thus, with this (all), He introduced Himself to His servants and encouraged them to reflect on His signs.&#8221;</strong></span> [Miftaah Daar as-Sa’aadah of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;&#8230; and one of the causes and incentives for eemaan is reflecting on the universe; on the creation of the heavens and earth and on the diverse types of creation contained within them; to look at the human himself and the attributes he possesses, for this is a strong incentive for eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">This is because of the greatness of creation found within these present entities, which points towards the might, capability and greatness of their Creator.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">It is also because of the prevalent beauty, order and perfection that baffles the learned, which point to the vastness of Allaah&#8217;s knowledge and the comprehensiveness of His wisdom and it is also because of the assorted benefits and abundant blessings that cannot be counted and are innumerable, which point to the magnitude of Allaah&#8217;s mercy, generosity and benevolence.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">All of this calls to the glorification of its originator and maker, to gratitude of Him, to becoming attached to His remembrance and having sincerity of religion to Him alone; this is the spirit  and secret of eemaan.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, page 31. See or-Riyaad an-Naadhirah also by Shaykh as-Sa&#8217;dee, pages 238-280]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, Allaah, <em><strong>al-Kareem</strong></em>, encourages His servants in His book to contemplate on these signs and indications and He directs them to study and reflect in many places within His Book. This is because of the many advantages for the slaves and the immense returns they attain from it. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِن مَّاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships that sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allaah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving </b>(living)<b> creatures of all kinds that he has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ إِذَا أَنتُم بَشَرٌ تَنتَشِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is that He created you from dust and behold, you are human beings, becoming widespread.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah ar-Room (30):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَاءُ قَدِيرٌ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and of all the creatures He has dispersed within them. And He is ever-potent over assembling them all if He so desires&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shooraa (42):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْجِبَالِ كَيْفَ نُصِبَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْأَرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not look at the camels: how they have been created? And at the heaven: how it is raised? And at the mountains: how they have been rooted and firmly fixed? And at the earth: how it has been spread out?&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):17-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other numerous similar <em>aayaat</em> in the Qur&#8217;aan, in which Allaah calls His servants to look at His signs and manifestations of his actions that represent the most supreme evidence of His oneness and singularity and for His might, will and knowledge. It is also evidence of His benevolence, gentleness and generosity. This is the greatest invitation of His servants towards having love of Allaah, thanking Him, glorifying Him, obeying Him and being attached to His remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, it becomes evident that study and contemplation of the Universe remains as one of the greatest causes of eemaan and the most beneficial incentives for it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Shaytaan</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is held to be a strong external reason, which causes eemaan to decrease. Shaytaan is a vehement enemy to the believers. He awaits calamities to afflict them. He has no desire or goal other than to jolt the eemaan in the hearts of the believers and to weaken and corrupt it. Whoever submits to the whisperings of Shaytaan, complies with his notions and does not retreat to Allaah for refuge from him, his eemaan weakens and decreases. Indeed, it may disappear in its entirety depending on the Muslim’s response to such whisperings and notions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that Allaah has warned us of Shaytaan in the sternest sense and He has clarified his dangers, the detrimental consequences of following him as well as the fact that he is an enemy to the believers. Allaah ordered the believers to take him as an enemy and therefore deliver themselves from him and his whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O you who believe! Do not follow the footsteps of Shaytaan, and whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan, then, verily he</b> (i.e., Shaytaan)<b> commands Fahshaa’ </b>(i.e., to commit indecency and lewdness, etc.)<b> and al-Munkar</b> (i.e., disbelief, shirk, to do evil and wicked deeds, to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islaam, etc.)<b>…”</b></span> [Soorah an-Noor (24):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوًّا ۚ إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely, Shaytaan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his hizb </b>(followers)<b> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.”</b></span> [Soorah Faatir (35):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</span> </b>[Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Shaytaan has taken hold of them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allaah. They are the party of Shaytaan. Verily, it is the party of Shaytaan that will be the losers!”</b></span> [Soorah al-Mujaadilah (58): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzee says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Hence it is an obligation upon the sane person to be on his guard against this enemy, who has manifested his enmity since the time of Aadam. He has sacrificed his life and self in corrupting the circumstances of the children of Aadam and Allaah has ordered one to be cautious of him…” He then mentioned a number of such texts and then said: “The like of this in the Qur’aan is abundant.” [Talbees Iblees, pg. 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad al-Maqdasee says in the introduction of his book Dhamm al-Waswaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To proceed, Allaah has indeed made Shaytaan an enemy to man. He sits in wait against him along the straight path and comes to him from every direction and way, as Allaah has related from him that he said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَالَ فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِي لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَاطَكَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ ثُمَّ لَآتِيَنَّهُم مِّن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَائِلِهِمْ ۖ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَاكِرِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely I will sit in wait against them on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as being grateful ones (i.e., they will not be dutiful to You).”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):16-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allaah has warned us against following him and commanded us to possess animosity towards him and to oppose him, He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</b></span> [Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230;يَا بَنِي آدَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ كَمَا أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O Children of Aadam! Do not let Shaytaan deceive you, as when he brought your parents </b>(i.e., Aadam and Hawwaa’)<b> out of Paradise…”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us of what he did with our parents as a way of cautioning us from obeying him and also to cut short any excuse for having followed him and Allaah commanded us to follow the straight path …” [Dhamm al-Waswaas, pg.46. Also refer to Ibn al-Qayyim’s introduction of his own book Ighaathah al-Lahfaan, 1/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Shaytaan is an enemy to man. His desire is to corrupt the beliefs and to wreak havoc on one’s eemaan. Whoever does not fortify himself from him through remembrance of Allaah, resorting back to Allaah and seeking refuge with Him, will become a breeding ground for Shaytaan, who will lure him to actions of disobedience, entice him to perpetrate prohibited matters and push him to embark upon lewd sins. What a perish of his religion and what a corruption of his eemaan will it be if man submits to him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beware of enabling Shaytaan to establish himself in the very home of your thoughts and intentions, as he will corrupt them in such a manner that will make difficult its correction thereafter. He will cast all sort of whisperings and harmful thoughts at you and he will prevent you from thinking about what may benefit you and it is you who have aided him against yourself by empowering him over your heart and thoughts and he then placed you in the possession of such thoughts.”</strong></span> [Al-Fawaa’id, pg. 309]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, put forward an excellent similitude in this regard, which lies in total agreement. He says in another excerpt from his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you would like a consistent example for this, then his parable is that of a dog that is extremely famished; between you and the dog is a piece of meat or bread. He looks attentively at you and sees you not opposing him and he is so close to you. You drive him away and yell out at him and yet the dog refuses but to hover round you in circles and to try to deceive you with regard to what you possess in your hand.”</span></strong> [At-Tibyaan fee Aqsaam al-Qur’aan, pg. 419]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His intention, may Allaah have mercy upon him, behind this parable is to demonstrate the scope of Shaytaan’s danger to man if he does not seek refuge with Allaah from him and fails to retreat back to Allaah for refuge from his evil, through beneficial words of supplication and blessed forms of remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever turns away and is instead averse to that, Shaytaan will cling to him in this way in which he will tempt and dictate to him until he eradicates his eemaan. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَنَا قَالَ يَا لَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“And whosoever turns away </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(blinds himself)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., this Qur’aan and worship of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, We appoint for him a shaytaan to be a Qareen </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., an intimate companion)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> to him. And verily, they </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., shaytaans)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> hinder them from the Path </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, whilst they think that they are guided aright! Till, when </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(such a)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> one comes to Us, he says </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(to his qareen)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Would that between me and you were the distance of the two Easts </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(or the East and West)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, a worst </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(type of)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> companion </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(you are indeed)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">!”</span></b>[Soorah az-Zukhruf (43):36-38]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>iv. The Soul that Greatly Commands Evil</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a condemned soul, which Allaah placed inside the individual. It orders him with every evil, invites him to all perils and guides him to every vulgarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is its nature and that is its trait, except for the soul that Allaah grants tawfeeq and which He makes firm and assists. None has been saved from the evil of his soul except by the tawfeeq of Allaah, as Allaah says relating from the wife of al-‘Azeez:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي ۚ إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“And I free not myself </b>(from the blame)<b>. Verily, the soul does indeed incline greatly to evil, except when my Lord bestows His Mercy </b>(upon whom He wills)<b>.Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</b></span> [Soorah Yoosuf (12):53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230;وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#008000;">…And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure…</span>”</b> [Soorah an-Noon (24):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says to the most honorable and beloved creation to Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَلَوْلَا أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئًا قَلِيلًا</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#008000;">And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little</span>.”</b> [Soorah al-Israa (17):74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet used to teach them (i.e., the people) the ‘Speech of Need’ (Khutbah al-Haajah): <i>“All praise is for Allaah; we praise Him, seek His aid and forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allaah from the <b>evil of our souls</b> and from the wickedness of our actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, then none can misguide him and whosoever Allaah misguides, then none can guide him.”</i><span style="color:#808080;"> [This speech has been related by Aboo Daawood, 2/237, an-Nasaa’iee, 3/105 and others. Refer to al-Albaanee’s treatise, Khutbah al-Haajah’ for he gathered all the narrations and wordings of this speech]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, evil is concealed within the soul and it necessitates actions of evil. If Allaah lets the servant have his own way with his soul, he will perish at the evil of his soul and the evil actions that it sanctions. If Allaah on the other hand, grants the servant tawfeeq and assists him, he will deliver him from all of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has made in contrast to this soul, a soul that is content [1]. If the soul that constantly commands evil urges the servant with something, the content soul prohibits him from it. The person at times obeys this soul, and at other times obeys the other; he himself is one of the two that is prevalent over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Allaah has assembled two souls: a soul that greatly orders (evil) and a soul that is content, and they are hostile towards one another. Whenever one diminishes, the other strengthens. Whenever one takes pleasure in something the other suffers pain as a result of it. Nothing is more difficult for the soul that constantly encourages evil than performing deeds for Allaah and preferring His pleasure to its own desire and there is nothing more beneficial to it than Allaah. Likewise, there is nothing more difficult upon the content soul than performing deeds for other than Allaah and that which the incentives of desire bring about, and there is nothing more harmful to it than desire… and the war is continuous, it cannot come to an end until it completes its appointed time from this world.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Jawaab al-Kaafee of Ibn al-Qayyim, pg. 184-185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, there is nothing more harmful to a person’s eemaan and religion than his soul that constantly commands evil, whose standing and description is such. It is a primary reason and effective and active constituent that weakens eemaan, unsettles it and impairs it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As such, it becomes imperative for the one who seeks to safeguard his eemaan from diminution and weakness to tend to the matter of calling his soul to account, admonishing it and to increase in censuring it, so that he can deliver himself from its adverse and devastating consequences and ends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Calling one’s self to account is of two types: a type (that occurs) before the action and a type (that occurs) after the action.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the first type,</strong></span> it is to take a stance when one first has an intention and desire, and not to embark upon the action until it becomes clear to him that performing that action outweighs leaving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the second type</strong></span>, which is to take account of one’s soul after the action, this is of three sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The first is to call it to account over any obedience in which it has fallen short with regard to the right of Allaah, whereby it has not performed it in the manner required.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The second is to call his soul to account over every action, which had he not undertaken would actually have better than having embarked upon it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The third is that he calls his soul to account for every permissible and habitual action; why did he embark upon it? Was his intention behind the action for Allaah and the home of the Hereafter; so that he be profitable? Or did he desire the world and its immediate and instant (pleasures)? If so he would lose out on that profit and that achievement will pass him by.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest harm upon the servant is negligence, to forgo calling oneself to take account, to let oneself go, to take things lightly and accommodate them. This will eventually lead him to destruction and this is the state of the people of delusion: one of them shuts their eyes to consequences, lets matters take their course and depends upon attaining pardon (from Allaah). Thus, he neglects calling himself to account and pondering over the outcomes. When he does behave in this manner, committing sins become an effortless matter for him, he feels at ease with it and it becomes difficult for him to break away from his habitual sinning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sum and substance of this is for the person to first call himself to account over the obligatory duties. If he finds deficiency in this regard, he amends this either by repayment or rectification. He then calls himself to account over prohibited matters. If he knows that he has perpetrated something prohibited, he amends this through repentance, seeking forgiveness and enacting good deeds that wipe such bad deeds away. He then calls himself to account over heedlessness. If it is the case that he has been careless of that which he was created for, he amends this through remembrance and turning to Allaah. He then calls himself to account over what he has spoken, or where his feet have taken him, or what his hands have struck out at or what his ears have listened out to: What did you intend from this? Who did you do it for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must know that for every movement and utterance he makes, two registers have to be set up: a register titled ‘Who did you do it for?’ and (the second register titled) ‘In what manner did you do it?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first (register) is a question on sincerity and the second is a question on conformity (to the Sharee’ah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the servant is responsible and accountable for everything: his hearing, his sight and his heart, it is therefore very becoming of him to call himself to account before the account is examined (ultimately, by Allaah). The obligation of calling oneself to account is established by His saying:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O you who believe! Fear Allaah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forward for tomorrow …”</b></span> [Soorah al-Hashr (59): 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purport is that the rectification of the heart is achieved through calling one’s self to account and its corruption is through negligence of one’s soul and not restraining it. [Refer to Ighaathah al-Lahfaan of Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/97-100] Allaah is the One Who is sought for help and there is no power or might except by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: “The soul invites to destructive matters, assists enemies, yearns every vulgarity and follows every evil. It, by its nature, adopts a course of violation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blessing that is unequalled, is to come away from the soul and to be free of its yoke, for it is the greatest partition between the servant and Allaah. The most knowledgeable people of the soul have the greatest contempt and abhorrence to it”[Ighaathah al-Lahfaan, 1/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that he give us refuge from the evils of our souls and from the wickedness of our actions. Indeed, He is the most Munificent, the Generous.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] i.e., not another soul but a different characteristic of the same soul. Al-Qaadee Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee, may Allaah have mercy upon him says in his commentary to al-Imaam at-Tahaawee’s treatise on ‘aqeedah: “Many people have recorded that the son of Aadam has three souls: a content soul (mutma’innah), a soul that reproaches much (lawwaamah) and a soul that greatly orders evil (ammaarah), and that some people are characterized by a particular one and others by another one. As Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230;يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#008000;">O (you) soul that is content (mutma’innah)…</span>”</b> [al-Fajr (89):27]</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَلَا أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#008000;">And I swear by the self-reproaching (lawwaamah) soul</span>.”</b> [al-Qiyaamah (75):2]</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#008000;">…Verily, the soul does indeed incline greatly to evil…</span>”</b> [Soorah Yoosuf (12):53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The precise determination however is that it is one soul, which has (different) characteristics. Thus, it greatly encourages evil. If it becomes opposed by eemaan it becomes one that reproaches often; it commits a sin then censures its doer and reproaches with regard to doing or not doing an action. If the eemaan strengthens, it then becomes one that is content…”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chapter 13 : Warning Against Having Extremism in the Deen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the great lessons of benefit for the pilgrim during his Hajj to the House of Allaah is the important lesson of taking the <strong>middle course and being just in all matters</strong>, keeping away from extremism, negligence, falling into excess or heedlessness. Allaah Ta’ala has said regarding this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Thus We have made you a just and the best nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger be a witness over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 143]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of His saying &lt;&lt; <strong>just and the best nation</strong> &gt;&gt; is: trustworthy witnesses, who do not shy away from the truth, so that they exaggerate, nor that they become unmindful but are are balanced and are just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj is full of great experiences and magnificent lessons which show the great importance of the straight path and of being balanced. From the most important circumstances in this great issue is looking to the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and his Sunnah regarding <strong>stoning the Jamaar</strong> and considering it in light of what has been mentioned by the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. After that, look at the state of the people in comparison to the Prophet’s Sunnah and you will see that the condition of these people is either that of exaggeration and excess or shortcoming and negligence, except for those whom Allaah has given the understanding of the religion and has honoured with adherence to the Prophetic Sunnah and imitation of his guidance and example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Nis’aee and Ibn Majah on the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhuma- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqaba while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So I collected seven small stones for him from the little stones and began to shake off their dust from his palm while he was saying: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he said: ‘O you people beware of exaggerating in the Deen because what destroyed those before you was indeed exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></span> [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim as Shaykh-ul-Islam -Rahimullaah- and others have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ i.e. the stones that were gathered for him had a specified size as is mentioned in the hadeeth. The stones were the size of those used for stoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word al-Hassa (stone) does not carry the meaning of small sized stones, such as pebbles, nor does it carry the meaning of a large sized stone, such as a rock but rather, what has been legislated is in between.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this issue has been clearly discussed with detailed explanation, if you were to compare this to the actions of some Muslims ignorant of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah you would find their actions relating to stoning the Jamaarat to be very strange. You will find them fluctuating between exaggeration and deficiency, increase and falling short or between excess and negligence. The truth, however, is found somewhere inbetween them. The Muslim does not have shortcomings regarding the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- unlike those who are negligent and incompetent or those who are excessive and exaggerate. The Muslim is just and balanced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -: ‘<strong>Beware of extremism</strong>.’ then this statement is general and it applies to all types of extremism in all aspects of belief and actions because the ruling derived is taken from the general wording of this hadeeth and not the specific reason for which the statement was revealed. The Muslim is prohibited from extremism in all circumstances and in all his affairs. He is ordered to follow the way of the Noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and adhere to his Sunnah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Shaytan strives absolutely to turn the believers, the slaves of Allaah, away from the right path and keep them far away from Allaah&#8217;s straight path either through extremism or negligence. The Shaytan uses every which way he can to be victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as some of the Salaf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Allaah did not command anything except that Shaytan incites evil with two commands; either negligence and shortcoming or exceeding the limits and extremism and he does not mind with which of the two he is victorious.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaytan is seated in the path of the Muslim. He does not become lax, nor does he become bored of his relentless plotting or his wait to ambush the Muslim. He strives absolutely to increase the Muslim in misguidance and to divert him from the straight path and clear guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah</strong>&#8211; said in his great book ‘<strong>Ighatha allhaffan min Masayid ash-Shaytaan</strong>’ :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘From his (Shaytan&#8217;s) plots (may Allaah have protect us and you from him) is that he scrutinizes the soul until he knows which of the two strengths can be overcome, the strength of boldness and courage or the strength of abstention, humility and shame. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards humility and abstention, he begins to hinder him and weaken the Muslim’s endeavour and resolve in what he has been ordered and charged with. So Shaytan makes it easy for him to leave that off until he regularly leaves off (what he has been ordered with) or lessens his (following) and neglects Allaah’s orders.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards the strength of boldness, zeal and lofty aspirations, he causes him to undervalue the commands of Allaah and makes him imagine that what he has is insufficient such that he needs to exaggerate and do extra along with that. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore, the Shaytan causes the first to reduce in what Allaah has commanded and causes the second to exceed. Most people, except very few, fall either reduction or excess &#8211; these two valleys &#8211; the valley of shortcoming and the valley of extremism. Only a very small number are steadfast on the path the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and what his Companions were upon.’</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- cites many examples of this, from different angles of the Deen, dividing the people into three groups: the extremists, the negligent and the people of the middle and straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being upright in all matters, taking the middle course and being far away from extremism and negligence is the correct methodology and the straight path which the believers are required to follow, just as Allaah commanded in His Book and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered. So truly being in the middle and being upright is holding onto the restrictions Allaah has laid down for His slaves, such that whatever is not from the religion is not added to it nor is anything from the religion excluded. This is what Allaah entrusts the believers with and what He commands them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [al-Furqan :67]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra: 29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra:26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [‘Aaraaf:31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Luqmaan:19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is authentically reported in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The middle course, the middle course will make you reach paradise.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: it is binding on you to take the middle course in all matters of speech and action. Moderation is being in the middle, between two extremes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported in Musnad and others that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Take the middle course of guidance, indeed the one who is severe in the Deen, then it will overcome him</strong></span>.’[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood –RadhiAllaahu anhu- used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Being restrained within the Sunnah is better than striving in Bida</strong></span>’.’[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Deen of Allaah is in the middle, between the one who goes to extremes and the one who is negligent. The best of people are those in the middle who have raised themselves above the shortcoming of the neglectful, but do not join the exaggeration of those who go beyond the limits. Rather the best of people stick to the guidance of the leader of the Messengers, the one chosen by The Lord of the Worlds who is an example for all people, Muhammad bin Abdullah, may Allaah&#8217;s Peace and Prayers be upon him, his Family and all his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<strong> <a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/" target="_blank">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj</a> – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr, </strong>Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 8 : An Explanation of the Obligation to Adhere to the Sunnah and to Take from the Guidance of the Messenger of Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the greatest benefits and lessons from Hajj for the pilgrims to the House of Allaah is knowing the importance of the Sunnah and limiting oneself to it in all actions of the Hajj. The importance of knowing the Sunnah becomes apparent from the state of many pilgrims who you see gathering together in circles of knowledge and remembrance. They ask the scholars many questions regarding the description of Hajj: how to perform it, its pillars and obligatory duties and those acts that negate it. These questions are asked with precision and enthusiasm, especially by those who, in their Hajj, are conscious of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-: ‘Take your Hajj rites from me’ [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Hajj will not be accepted by Allaah unless the Muslim does it in the manner of the Messenger of Allaah, adhering to his guidance in the Hajj and following his Sunnah &#8211; without excess or negligence, without going to extremes or being without purpose and without adding to or taking away from it. So if a Muslim adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his Hajj and limits himself to his guidance, he benefits from the knowledge that adhering to the Sunnah and following his -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wasallam- guidance is obligatory in all acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it is necessary to take the rites of Hajj from the Messenger, it is also necessary for all Muslims to take the guidance of the Messenger in every act of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said with regards to prayer: ‘pray as you have seen me praying.’ [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in all matters of general obedience: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus all actions which are not done in accordance to the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- will not be accepted by Allaah, as is shown by his explicit statement -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this proves that every innovation (Bida’) introduced into the religion has no foundation in the Book or Sunnah, regardless of whether it is from knowledge-based verbal innovations or practical, worship-based innovations. So whoever informs of other than that which Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have informed or worships in a way that Allaah and His Messenger have not permitted then this will be returned to the one who did it and it will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth also implies the meaning that anyone who does an action in accordance to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded i.e. is worshipping Allaah with correct creed and righteous actions from what is obligatory and recommended, then his action will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and others on the authority of al-Irbaad bin Sariyyah –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- led us in prayer that day, then turned and faced us and gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said: ‘It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I advise you to hear and obey, even if a slave rules over you. Indeed whosoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth. Beware of newly invented matters, since every Bida’ is misguidance.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ then this is from his comprehensive, eloquent speech. This statement is a great principle from the principles of the Deen and it resembles the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus anyone who innovates and ascribes something to the Deen which has no foundation to which it can be referred, then it is misguidance which the Deen is free from, the one who innovates has the innovation rejected and it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Deen of Allaah is built upon two great, strong principles and foundations. Firstly; That we do not worship except Allaah Alone who has no partner. Secondly; That we do not worship Him except with what He legislated on the tongue of His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. We do not worship Allaah according to our desires or Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then We have put you on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allaah &gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah : 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Or do they have partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt; [Shura: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for anyone to worship Allaah except with what His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- legislated from obligatory and recommended actions. We do not worship Him with newly invented matters which have no foundation in the Deen nor any basis for them in the Sharia’. It is not allowed for anyone to worship anything except Allaah Alone, so no-one is allowed to pray except to Allaah, nor fast except for Allaah, nor perform the Hajj except to His house, nor rely upon anyone except Him, nor can anyone direct any aspect of worship to anyone except Him.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah combined these two great principles in His –<br />
Subhanhu- statement :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&gt;&gt;[Kahf :110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good action is that which is in agreement with the pure Sharia’ and is sincere i.e. that which is not done, except for Allaah’s Face. These are the two pillars for acceptance of actions. So if an action is done sincerely but is not correct then it will not be accepted and if the action is correct but is not done sincerely for Allaah, then it will not be accepted unless the action is sincere and correctwhere sincere means that it is done purely for Allaah and being correct means that it is done according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory on every Muslim who hopes for success and happiness for himself in this world and the hereafter is that he attaches himself to the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, that his action conforms to his &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah and that he is wary of deviating from his guidance, opposing his Sunnah or following other than his path; since he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is a guide and example for his nation, as Allaah Ta’ala said regarding him :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for he who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [Ahzab:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means : ‘He has more right over them in all aspects of the Deen and worldly affairs and he is of greater importance to them than their ownselves or anyone else. It is obligatory upon them to give what he determines from their wealth even if they are in need of it. It is obligatory upon them to have more love for him than for their ownselves, and it is obligatory upon them to put his rulings first, before their own rulings for their ownselves. In brief, if the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- calls them to something and they themselves call to something else then it is obligatory for them to give precedence to what he calls them to and to defer what they themselves call to. It is obligatory upon them to have obedience to him which supersedes obedience to their ownselves and that they prefer obedience to him before that which their ownselves incline to and their inner selves desire.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this necessitates that the Muslim strives to know the Sunnah and sacrifices time in the path to knowing the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- &#8211; which is done by questioning the people of knowledge, sitting in the circles of remembrance where the rules of Halaal and Haraam are explained and also by reading beneficial books and useful works which collect these issues. So after that a Muslim can establish a path whereby he can worship correctly on a sound methodology, in agreement with the guidance of the noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<strong> <a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/" target="_blank">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj</a> – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr, </strong>Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Nine : On the Day of ‘Arafah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the day of ‘Arafah is a great day from the blessed days of Allaah and is a large gathering from the gatherings of goodness, Eemaan and Taqwaa. It is a season which is welcomed with great importance. A season from the seasons of obedience and worship, a day where the shedding of tears increases, where there are continuous supplications, where mercy descends and shortcomings are rectified, a day where mistakes are forgiven, a day of hope and humility, submissiveness and humbleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is a noble blessed day. The sun never rose on a day better than the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed it has been specified with noble merits, great privileges and important characteristics. It is no easy task to encompass all its characteristics, nor is it possible to fully investigate them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the day on which Allaah completed this Deen for the Ummah and completed His favour for them, as on that day the saying of Allaah Ta’ala was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Maida:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing about the Halaal or Haraam was revealed after that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Tariq bin Shihaab who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘A man from the Jews came to Umar bin al-Khattab &#8211; radiAllaahu anhu &#8211; and said: ‘O Ameer ul-Mumineen, indeed you read an Ayaah in your Book and had this Ayaah been revealed to us, the Jewish nation, we would have taken that day as a festival.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So Umar -radiAllaahu anhu- said: ‘And which Ayaah is that?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he replied: the saying of Allaah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;This day have I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you&gt;&gt;[al-Maida:3]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then Umar said: I swear by Allaah, indeed I know on what day it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and the hour in which it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. It was revealed in the evening of ‘Arafah on a Friday.’[1]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this noble blessed day, there are many of Allaah’s slaves who are saved from Hellfire. Allaah is generous to His believing slaves and He boasts about them in front of the Angels that are near Him. It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book of hadeeth on the authority of ‘Aeysha &#8211; radiAllaahu anha – that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no day on which Allaah frees as many slaves from the Hell-Fire as the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed He comes close to them, boasts about them to the Angels and then says: ‘What do they want?’</strong></span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said: ‘This indicates that they have been forgiven; because Allaah does not boast about the people who have mistakes and sins except after they have sought repentance and forgiveness.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr &#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘ Indeed Allaah Ta’ala boasts to His Angels with the people of ‘Arafah on the evening of ‘Arafah and says: Look at My slaves. They come to Me with dishevelled hair and covered in dust.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said in his famous poetry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah is that great standing * Like the standing of the Day of Judgement, rather that is greater</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He The Jabbar –the Glorified- comes closer that Day * He boasts about them to what He possesses, but He is more generous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: My slaves have come to Me with love * and I am to them more Generous and more Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I testify that I have indeed forgiven their sins * and I have given them what they had hoped for and bestowed blessings</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be it glad tidings O people of that great place * by it Allaah forgives the sins and gives mercy</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad -Rahimullaah- stood in ‘Arafah and saw the sobbing and crying of the people during the evening of ‘Arafah, then said: ‘Do you not see if all these people came to a man and asked him for a small coin, would he refuse them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘No,’ so he replied: I swear by Allaah, that Allaah forgiving them is easier than this man trying to fulfil their request of a small coin.’ 5(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why it is necessary for the Muslim who desires profit and gain on this blessed day to be humble to his Lord -Subhanahu- to humble himself for Him, lower himself in honour of Allaah, feel powerless in front of Him, hope for His mercy and forgiveness, fear His punishment and that which He hates, repent to Him from every sin that one’s hands have earned and from every mistake one’s feet walked towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim does not waste his time at this great place by going here and there or by chatting with this person and that person, rather he turns to his Lord and Protector, making much Dhikr (remembrance) and Dua’ (supplication), seeking forgiveness and begging from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is established in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The best supplication is the supplication of the day of ‘Arafat and the best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partner and to Him belongs the Dominion. To Him belongs the praise and He is capable/has power over all things.’[6]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Day of ‘Arafah is a day of supplication and the best Dhikr (remembrance) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah.’ The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say the best Dhikr (remembrance) abundantly on the best of the days, since the best of days is the day of ‘Arafah and the best of Adhkaar (plural of Dhikr) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship except Allaah.’ So saying the best of Adhkaar plentifully on the best of days is the most appropriate aim and match.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the statement: ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah,’ which the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say a great deal on the day of ‘Arafah, is the best of words, the most magnificent of all statements, the firmest handhold and it is a statement of Taqwaa and the key to the land of eternal happiness. It is the principle of the Deen and its foundation, and the head of its matter. Due to ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) the heavens and the earth were established, the creation was created, the Messengers were sent and the Divine Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The excellence of these words and their status in the Deen are indescribable and greater than the claims of those who say they know its virtues. On the contrary, it has virtues and distinctions which could not ever enter one’s mind or one’s imagination. However, it is obligatory for the Muslim to know that ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) is not accepted from the one who merely pays lip service to it, without establishing its rights and obligations or fulfilling its principles and conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah), is not a statement with no meaning or reality, nor are they words without any content. Rather these great words indeed have a meaning which it is necessary to understand, which have to be comprehended and an aim which it is necessary to adopt. There is agreement amongst the people of knowledge that this statement is not beneficial if it is, either, merely pronounced without understanding its meaning, or if what it necessitates is not acted upon as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession; except those who bear witness to the truth, and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allaah)</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [az-Zuhkruf : 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means: except those who testify ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ and their hearts know the meaning of what their tongues declare. There is no doubt that this matter is of utmost importance and that it is fitting that every Muslim should concern himself with it fully and pay complete attention to it. Indeed ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) does not benefit except the one who knows its meaning, both the negation and affirmation, and believes in and acts by it. As for the one who says it and acts upon it outwardly without believing in it then he is a hypocrite. As regards the one who says it and acts contrary to it with Shirk then he is a disbeliever. Also the one who says it and then apostatises from Islaam by rejecting something of what it necessitates from its rights, then it does not benefit him even if he says it a thousand times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who says it and then directs any aspect of worship to other than Allaah, such that he supplicates to or seeks aid from other than Him or seeks 4help, assistance or victory from other than Allaah in those things where only Allaah has the capability, or other such similar acts of worship, then whoever directs away from Allaah that which is only befitting Him is a Mushrik, even if he says ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’. This is because this great statement entails making all worship purely for Allaah’s sake and not associating partners with Him, turning to Allaah Alone, without any partner, with humbleness and submissiveness, with striving and strong desire and turning repentantly with trust and reliance in supplication and request.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion of ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ does not ask except from Allaah nor does he seek deliverance and rescue except from Allaah. He does not trust in or rely except upon Allaah nor does he have hope or longing for other than Allaah. He does not sacrifice except for Allaah nor does he avert any of the acts of worship to other than Allaah. He disbelieves in everything that is worshipped besides Allaah and he clears them away from<br />
Allaah.[7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having Sincerity for Allaah During Supplication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great acts of worship the Muslims increase upon and show great concern for during the Hajj is Dua’, which is the most important form and best type of worship. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- described in the authentic hadeeth that Dua’ in itself is worship due to its great status and lofty nature. This is why there are many texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah showing the great importance and high status of Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts comprise praise for making Dua’, encouragement to make Dua’ and inspire different ways to make Dua’, sometimes with a command to make Dua’, sometimes explaining its position and status, sometimes praising the people who make Dua’ and sometimes mentioning the great and different types of reward for those who make Dua’ and warning against those who neglect to make Dua’ or refuse to do so out of haughtiness or arrogance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good doers.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Araaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness,] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What increases the pilgrims in their concern for Dua’ and strengthens them in it during the Hajj is that they have combined the virtue and honour of the place they are in with the virtue and honour of the time period they are in, along with what descends upon their hearts of gentleness, humility and turning towards Allaah, especially on the Day of ‘Arafat which is the greatest and most noble of days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed it is known that on the evening of ‘Arafat Eemaan, mercy, light and blessings which cannot be expressed descend upon the hearts of the pilgrims.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- regarding the great matter of Dua’ on the Day of ‘Arafat and in explanation of its excellence, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> ‘The best of Dua’ is the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘… and from the Fiqh of the previous hadeeth is that the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat is better than all other Dua’. Also, in this hadeeth, is evidence that the Dua’s on the Day of ‘Arafat are all, generally, answered.’</strong></span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Hajj there are specific places at which it is necessary for the Muslim to stop. It is appropriate to make Dua’ at these places emulating the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, as it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would stop there, face the Qiblah and supplicate to Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There are six places in particular:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) In ‘Arafat &#8211; as previously mentioned.<br />
(2) In the places of al-Haraam where the Hajj rites take place, as Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then when you leave ‘Arafat, remember Allaah at Mash&#8217;ar-il-Haram</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3,4) On as-Safa and al-Marwa as is established in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir -RadhiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to stand on as-Safa he would say Allaahu Akbar three times and would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would do that three times and make Dua’ and would do likewise on al-Marwa.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5,6) After the stoning the two Jamaraat (the small one and medium one) as it is established in Saheeh Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Umar –Radhi Allaahu anhu- used to stone the small Jamaarah with seven small pebbles and used to recite Takbeer on throwing each stone. He then, would proceed further until he reached level ground, where he would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the medium Jamaarah similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the big Jamaarah from the middle of the valley but he would not stay by it. Ibn Umar used to say: ‘This is what I saw the Messenger of Allaah doing.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the six places where it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-stood, made Dua’ and raised his hands. Dua’ is a great matter and has a high status in Hajj. Generally, Dua’ has an innate nature in all aspects of worship, it is the spirit and essence of worship and it is established from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said: ‘Dua’ is worship.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If making Dua’ has distinguished status and a high rank then it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have a great concern for the significance of Dua’. He should understand that he is bound by its conditions and should be refined by its manners. He should be on-guard to avoid any actions that would prevent a Dua’ from being answered and he should be aware of the times when Dua’ is most likely to be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important matter in this great act that is necessary for the Muslim to check, is that his Dua’ is solely and sincerely for Allaah – Azza wa Jal. So he does not make Dua’ except to Allaah, he does not seek aid except from Allaah, nor does he request assistance, support and help or cure except from Allaah. This is because Dua’, as previously mentioned, is worship and directing any act of worship to other than Allaah is Major Shirk which takes a person outside of Islaam. We seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And invoke not besides Allaah any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will. And He is The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful &gt;&gt; [Yunus : 106-107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilâh (god), for whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! the disbelievers will not be successful &gt;&gt; [al-Muminoon:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah &gt;&gt;[Jinn : 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, there are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of making Dua’ is what Allaah Ta&#8217;ala mentioned in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good – doers &gt;&gt;[al-‘Aaraaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Dua’, the Muslim combines bringing presence of the heart and the feeling of dire need of what is sought with the Dua’. He does this causing it to coincide with the best times for Dua’ along with Khushoo’ (humility) in the heart, subservience to his Lord, submission to Him, imploring Him, having graciousness, having faced the Qibla in a state of purification, raising his hands to Allaah, beginning with praise and exaltation of Allaah and joining this with prayer upon Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who is His slave and Messenger. After this, he puts forward, to Allaah, his requests of repentance and forgiveness, then beseeches Allaah, earnestly asking of Him with total subservience to Him, supplicating to Him with fervent desire and dread and seeking closeness to Him with His Names, Attributes and Tawheed. He makes this Dua’ with sincerity and so this Dua’ is not about to ever be rejected. This is especially so if all of this coincides with supplications the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- taught as well as the best times and places for the answering of supplications along with the greatest Name of Allaah, whereby if He is asked He bestows and if He is called with it, He answers the supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the supplications established in the books of Sunnah is: that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- heard a man saying: ‘O Allaah. I ask of You, whereby I testify that You are Allaah, there is no god except You, The One, The SelfSufficient, Who is not begotten nor does He beget and there is none that resembles Him.’ So the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed you have asked Allaah with His greatest name which if He is asked by, He bestows, and if He is supplicated to with it, He answers.’[8]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Obligation of Having Sincerity When Slaughtering the Sacrificial Animal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great days of Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day from the month of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of the blessed ‘Eid al-Adha. This day has been called the day of an-Nahr because the Muslims seek closeness to Allaah on that Day by slaughtering grazing livestock (sheep, camels, cattle, goats). Pilgrims on this day slaughter their sacrificial animals and the Muslims in every scattered part of the earth slaughter their sacrificial animals too, seeking closeness to Allaah by doing so, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em><span style="color:#008000;">And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your (God) is One (God &#8211; Allaah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islaam). And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin [those who obey Allaah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism],</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allaah is mentioned; who patiently bear whatever may befall them (of calamities); and who perform the prayer and who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have provided them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Budn (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of Makkah.) We have made for you as among the Symbols of Allaah, therein you have much good. So mention the Name of Allaah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then, when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat thereof, and feed the beggar who does not ask (men), and the beggar who asks (men). Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may magnify Allaah for His Guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (doers of good).</span></em> &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 34-37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: The intent is not just slaughtering but, indeed what has been legislated for you is slaughtering this sacrifice so that you remember Allaah at the slaughter, as He indeed is The Creator and The Provider, it is not that He will take anything from its meat or its blood, for Allaah Ta’ala is in no need of other than Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt; but it is piety from you that reaches Him&gt;&gt;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: to have sincerity, hope of gaining reward, a good intention and a desire for the Face of Allaah by performing good actions. In 1this is a great encouragement and motivation to have sincerity in slaughtering and that the intent should be the Face of Allaah alone, because Allaah Ta’ala does not accept actions except those that are sincere, with which one only desires the Face of Allaah –Subhanahu- as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;Say: &#8220;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, The Lord of all that exists. He has no partner.  And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</span></em> [Anaam: 162-163]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer –Rahimullaah- said in explanation of this Ayaah: ‘Allaah Ta’ala commands the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to inform the Mushrikeen who worship other than Allaah and slaughter in other than His name, that he is in opposition to them in this. Indeed his prayer is for Allaah and his sacrifices are in the name of Allaah alone, Who has no partner. This is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> [Anaam: 162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that your prayer and your slaughtering should be sincerely for Allaah. Indeed the Mushrikeen used to worship idols and slaughter for them, so Allaah Ta’ala ordered the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to oppose them, to turn away from what they were upon and to face Allaah with purpose, intention and determination, doing so sincerely for Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said regarding Allaah’s saying <strong>&lt;&lt;my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> i.e. ritual: slaughtering in the Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubair who said regarding the word:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> : my slaughtering.</p>
<p>As-Saadi and Dhihaak also said the same thing.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slaughtering is a great act from the different types of worship with which the Muslims seek nearness to their Lord –Azza wa Jal – fulfilling rites for the sake of Allaah Ta’ala from slaughtering the sacrificial animal to vows to other such things. So it is not permissible to direct these acts of worship to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been established in the authentic book of hadeeth by Muslim from the hadeeth of the Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib –radhiAllaahu anhuwho said: the Messenger of Allaah-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- informed me of four statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Allaah’s curse is upon the one who slaughters for other than Allaah, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who curses his parents, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who gives shelter to an innovator and Allaah’s curse is upon the one who changes signposts which mark directions on the earth.’ [2]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accursedness meaning exiled and being distant from the Mercy of Allaah. The most dangerous of these four matters, such that the one who does it is deserving of this punishment, is slaughtering for other than Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- mentioned it first, which shows the great danger of this matter, as slaughtering for other than Allaah is Shirk, whereas the other points mentioned are from the major sins but they do not reach the level of Shirk. Any type of slaughtering done for other than Allaah is Shirk even if what is slaughtered -seeking closeness to Allaah- is insignificant or small such as a fly or something similar to that. So how about the one seeking closeness while he sacrifices the best and the finest of animals?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his book ‘az-Zuhd’, by Abu Na’eem in his book ‘al-Hileeya’ and in other places on the authority of Salman alFarsi –RadhiAllaahu anhu- with an authentic chain stopping at him, that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘A man entered Paradise due to a fly and another man entered the Fire due to a fly. They asked, ‘How is that?’ He replied: Two men from before your time passed by some people who had an idol and none could pass by them except that he had to sacrifice to their idol.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to one of the two men: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I don’t have anything.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said: Sacrifice something, even if it is a fly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he sacrificed a fly and passed by, then entered the Hell-fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to the other man: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I never sacrifice anything for other than Allaah –Azza wa Jal. So they chopped his head off and he entered Paradise.’[3]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows the wickedness of Shirk and the severity of its danger that, even if it is with something small, it obligates entry into Hell-fire. So, when the first man sacrificed a despicable and the vilest of animals, a fly, for the idol his reward was the Fire due to him committing Shirk in the worship of Allaah. If this is the case of the one who sacrificed by slaughtering a fly, then what is the state of the one who fattens a camel or a sacrificial animal then slaughters it for the one he worships other than Allaah such as graves, tombs, stones, trees or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- said in his book ‘Sharh as-Sadoor’: ‘This is from the causes of extreme evil, by which the evil companion is thrown behind the wall of Islaam from the highest point of the Deen and lands on his skull. So much so that many of them come with the best of the livestock they possess and the most excellent of what they have of sheep and cattle, then they slaughter them at the graves seeking closeness to them and hoping that this (closeness) can be attained from the graves. So they sacrifice for other than Allaah and, as a result, they worship one from amongst the idols, because there is no difference between slaughtering for the erected stones they call idols and slaughtering for and at the grave of the deceased calling it a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple difference in description does not affect something’s being Halaal or being Haram. The one who calls alcohol by other than its true name and drinks it has the same ruling as the one who calls alcohol by its name and drinks it, there is no difference of opinion amongst any of the Muslims in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that slaughtering is one type from the different types of worship for Allaah, similar to slaughtering the sacrificial animal and atonement. So the one who seeks closeness to the inhabitant of the grave and slaughters for it does not have any other intent in so-doing except to glorify and honour the grave, to seek to attain goodness from it and to fend off evil due to it. This is, no doubt, worship and it suffices as evil just to hear of it. There is no power or might except with Allaah, The Most High, The Most Great, to Allaah we belong and to Him is our return. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘In Islaam there is no slaughtering animals near graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq Sanaani said: ‘They used to slaughter at the grave, i.e. cows and sheep’ as narrated by Abu Daawood with an authentic chain of narration on the authority of Anas ibn Maalik.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- was very eloquent in his advice and very good in warning against this dangerous issue. We ask Allaah, The Most Noble that He saves us all from falling into any of this and that He makes all our actions sincerely for His Noble Face, in accordance with the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Indeed Allaah is The Most Generous and The Most Noble.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certainly the most excellent favor and the most complete blessing for the people of paradise is seeing their Lord, The Most Greatest, The One Who Possesses, honor and beauty. This is the delight of their hearts and the comfort of their eyes, the greatest bliss and pleasure in the abode of delight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was narrated by Muslim in his saheeh on the authority of Suhayb, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">When the people of paradise enter the paradise Allaah the Blessed and Most High will say: &#8220;Do you desire an increase in anything?&#8221; The people will say: &#8220;Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into the paradise and saved us from the fire?!&#8221; He (the Prophet) said: ‘He (Allaah) will then remove the covering and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.’ </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a connection between seeing Allaah and the prayer. Whoever is from the people who establish prayer, then he is much deserving of this favor. And the one who is neglectful (of the prayer) then he is worthy of being deprived (of this favor) and will be from the people of loss. Certainly, this connection is substantiated by the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, Allaah says:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">“Faces that Day will radiant (22) Looking towards their Lord, (23) And many faces, that day, will be gloomy, (24) Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them. (25) Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles, (26) And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)” (27) And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,) (28) And one shank is intertwined with the other shank, (29) Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven. (30) So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed, (31) But rejected the truth and turned away (from it)(32)”</span> (75:22-32)</p>



<p>So His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Faces that day will be radiant&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:22)<br />Meaning; from the beauty, meaning a beautiful radiance; brightly pleased. And His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Looking at their Lord&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:23)<br />Meaning: by seeing Him with their eyes, by their vision.</p>



<p>Hasan al-Basri said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8216;They have the right to be radiant while they are looking at the Creator. Then Exalted is He, mentioned another category (of people) the people whose faces will be contorted, completely gloomy. He mentioned from among their actions was abandonment of the prayer. This shows that the people of the first category are the people of radiance and are those who will see Allaah. These are from the people who establish the prayer.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>As for (evidence from) the Sunnah</strong>, then in the two Saheeh&#8217;s, on the authority of Jareer ibn Abdillaah, who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he looked towards the moon on a full-moon night and said afterwards: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him. So if you are able to not be occupied and overcome by things which will distract you from the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets then do so!&#8217;</span> Meaning the Asr prayer and the Fajr. Then Jareer recited (the verse) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And praise your Lord before the sun rise and before the sunset&#8221;</span> (20:130)</p>



<p>In this hadeeth is an indication to the connection between the prayer and seeing (Allaah).</p>



<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;It is said as it relates to the command with preserving these two prayers coming immediately after mention of the seeing (of Allaah) that the greatest (loftiest) thing in paradise is seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and the most noble of actions in the life of this world are these two prayers. Therefore in guarding them it is hoped that the person will enter Paradise and will see Allaah there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there is no doubt that the companions when they heard the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him&#8217;</span>, a great yearning filled their souls and a wondering about the actions which will be the cause of obtaining this greatly sought pursuit. And from the excellence of the Prophet&#8217;s advice and completeness of his clarification, he answered it without being asked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this is an indication from him (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that, seeing Allaah on the Day of Judgment will not be obtained by merely wishing. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is not a matter of your merely wishing or the wishing of the People of the Book&#8221;</span> (4:123) Rather it is a must to perform actions, be upright, strive hard and have full commitment to Allaah. For this reason the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained the means which will allow the servant to obtain seeing Allaah. Therefore he directed to two great prayers, namely Fajr and Asr. Many texts have been narrated in relation to the matter of these two (prayers) which point to their virtues. They are mentioned specifically for what is contained in them of great virtues and from the weightiness (of them) upon many people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore whoever elevates his concern and Allaah assists him and gives him success in preserving these two prayers then he must be much more preserving of the other prayers (as well) rather the Fajr prayer specifically, (as it ) is the commencement of the day. Whoever Allaah honors with getting up to perform this prayer and giving importance to it will be aided for the remaining prayers of that day. For how the servant acts in relation to the Fajr prayer applies (to his actions) for the rest of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As some of the Salaf would say: <strong>&#8220;Your day is like your camel; if you take hold of the beginning of it then the later part of it will follow you&#8221; </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the Prophet&#8217;s statement:<strong> &#8220;Do not become occupied…&#8221;</strong> Is an indication that in this life are many affairs that will distract and divert man from guarding these two prayers. And how much more are the things that divert in these days of ours! There are people whom drinking tea overcomes and diverts from these prayers which is the beauty of this worldly life. Some are distracted by petty conversation, immoral night chat, useless entertainment and evil viewings. And also from people are those whom sleep overcomes, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this Hadeeth also is evidence that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>correct sound belief</strong> </span>affects the actions of the slave and his ways. So the more his faith increases and his certainty strengthens, the more he increases in uprightness, diligence, (righteous) work, and observing the obedience of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And because of this connection between the prayer and seeing Allaah our Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of his prayer before tasleem for this great delight and wealthy reward. Narrated by an-Nasai in his sunan on the authority of Ataa ibn as-Saaib from his father who said: &#8220;Ammaar bin Yaasir led us in prayer and he shorted it. So some of the people said to him:&#8217;you have made the prayer light or shorted it! He said: &#8216;As for that, I was supplicating with some supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allaah. So he when he stood a man from the people followed him, he was Ubay though he didn&#8217;t reveal his name and asked him about the supplication then the man came (back) and informed the people of it. (The supplication was)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen and by Your Power over the creation , let me live if You know that life is good for me , and let me die if You know that death is good for me . O Allaah , I ask You to grant me fear of You in private and in the open . I ask you for the word of truth in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e. pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face and the earning of meeting You without any harmful distress and misleading trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith, and make us guides who are upon (correct) guidance. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah favor us all with guarding the prayer. We ask Allaah for the delight of looking at His Face and the yearning to meet Him without any harmful distress or misleading trial.</p>



<p>We ask Allaah to make this a benefit for us and for you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 01</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed the best speech and the most excellent remembrance after the Noble Qur’aan is four statements</strong>. They have an exceptional value, they consist of a great matter and have a high status in the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many texts, which show the excellence of these four statements that emphasize this great matter, and the value of these statements and the resulting great reward when establishing them and their noble excellence and their continuous benefits in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter. We will attempt to present some of the excellence of these statements from some of the texts, which mention these benefits.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- So from the excellence of these words is that they are the most beloved speech to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim collected in his book from the hadeeth of Sumrah bin Jundab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The most beloved speech to Allaah consists of four, there is no harm with which one you begin, <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And collected by Tayyalisi in his ‘Musnad’ with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are four statements that are the most beloved speech to Allaah, and they are in the Qur’aan, there is no harm which one you begin with: <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From their excellence is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us that they are more beloved to him than what the sun rose upon (i.e. from the <em>Dunyaa </em>and what is in it,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim collected in his book ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’ from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed that I say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>) is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon</strong></span>.’ [3]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From their excellence is, what is mentioned in ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘<em>Shu’ab al-Eeman</em>’ by Bayhaqi with a good <em>Isnaad</em> from Assim bin Bahdalah from Abu Salih from Umm Hani bint Abu Talib who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah walked past me so I said: ‘Indeed I have become old and weak – or something similar to this – then he ordered me with an action which I should do while I am sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say <em>Subhana Allaah</em> one hundred times, indeed it is equivalent to freeing one hundred slaves from the offspring of Isma’eel. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> one hundred times, it is the equivalent to one hundred horses saddled with reins ready to carry a person in the path of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Allaahu akbar</em> one hundred times, since it is the equivalent to one hundred camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>La illaah ila Allaah</em> one hundred times, </strong></span>Ibn Khalf (the narrator from Aasim) said: I think he said<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>: it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and on that day no one will have an action raised except the one who came with the like of it.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mundhari said: Ahmad collected it with a <em>Hasan</em> <em>Isnad </em>[5] and the ‘allaama al-Albaani declared its <em>Isnad</em> <em>Hasan</em>.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect upon this great reward, which is a result of these words. So whoever says <em>Subhana Allaah</em> hundred times then it is the equivalent to freeing a hundred slaves from the sons of Isma’eel, the offspring of Isma’eel was mentioned specifically because they are the noblest of the Arabs in lineage.  Whoever says <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who gave charity of one hundred horses saddled and reined ready to carry the <em>Mujahideen</em> in the path of Allaah. Whoever says <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who spends camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. Whoever said <em>laa illaah ila Allaah</em> a hundred times then it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and no one’s action is raised except if one comes with what was mentioned.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- From the excellence of the status of these words, is that they are an expiation for sins. It is mentioned in ‘<em>al-Musnad</em>’, ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’ and ‘Mustadrak al-Hakim’ from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-‘Aaas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no person on earth who says: ‘<em>laa illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, wa Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>, (There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah) except that his sins are expiated even if they were more than the foam on the sea.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>, and al-Hakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed with him and al-Albaani declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning ‘expiation of sins’ here it means minor sins, as is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The five daily prayers, from one <em>Juma’</em> till the next <em>Juma’</em>, from one <em>Ramadhan</em> till the next <em>Ramadhan</em> is an expiation for what takes place between them as long as the major sins are kept away from.’</strong></span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore expiation of sins has been limited to keeping away from the major sins; because a major sin can only be expiated by repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also there is a hadeeth that has been collected with the same meaning by Tirmidhi and other than him from Anas bin Malik <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> walked passed a tree which had dry leaves and he hit that tree with his stick and the leaves began to fall, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed <em>al-Hamdu lillaahi, wa Subhana Allaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, </em>cause the sins of a slave of Allaah to fall just like the leaves of this tree are falling.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Declared <em>Hasan</em> by al-Albaani.[9]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From the excellence of these words is that they are plants of Paradise, Tirmidhi collected from Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met the Prophet Ibrahim on the night when I was taken on the night journey, and Ibrahim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Muhammad convey my <em>Salam</em> to your <em>Ummah</em>, and inform them that Paradise has very fine soil, sweet water. That it has lowland and its plants are:  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest)’</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Isnaad</em> of this hadeeth is AbdurRahman bin Ishaaq, however the hadeeth has two supporting narrations which strengthen this narration from the hadeeth of Abu ‘Ayyoub al-Ansari and from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning is that plants in Paradise grow quickly due to these statements, just like the plants that are planted on lowland and the growth of its plants is fast.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From its excellence is that there is none better according to Allaah than a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi,’ a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is collected by Imam Ahmad and by Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Laylah’ with a Hasan Isnaad from Abdullaah bin Shaddad: is that a group of three people from the tribe of Udhraah came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and accepted Islaam and Abdullaah said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Who will look after them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I will.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah said: ‘They stayed with Talha and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>sent out a delegation and one of them went in it and was martyred.  Abdullaah said: then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sent another a delegation and another person went with them and was martyred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah continued: then the third person died on his bed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I saw these three people who stayed with me [in a dream] they were in Paradise, and I saw the one who died on his bed in front of them, and I saw the one who was martyred last after him and I saw the one who was martyred last behind them.  Talha said: I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I mentioned this to him, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why did you not stop them from going with the delegation, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>there is none better according to Allaah from a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi</em>,’ a lot.’</strong></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great hadeeth shows the great excellence of the one who has a long life and his actions are good, and his tongue continues to be moist with the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah – Azza wa Jal, and success is from Allaah Alone.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 02</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Previously, we covered a number of virtues of these four statements: they are the best speech after the Qur’aan, they are ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we will continue with another number of benefits from these statements from the Ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> which mention these statements:</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- From their excellence is that Allaah chose these statements and chose them for His slave, and Allaah has set aside for the one who remembers Allaah saying them, with great and abundant reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘Mustadrak’ of al-Hakim with an authentic <em>Isnaad </em>from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira and Abu Sa’eed <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhumma</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah chose four statements: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>). So whoever says ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>,’ twenty good deeds are written for him, and twenty bad deeds are taken away.  Whoever says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar</em>’ then he gets likewise. Whoever says ‘<em>La illaah ila Allaah</em>,’ then he gets likewise.  Whoever says ‘<em>Alhamdulillaahi Rabbil Al-Ameen</em>’ from his own self then thirty good deeds are written for him and thirty sins are cancelled from him.’</strong> </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward for the slave of Allaah saying <em>al-Hamd</em> (Praise) is increased more than the other four, when he says it from his own self; this is because <em>al-Hamd</em> does not generally occur except after a reason for saying it, like eating or drinking, or the occurrence of a blessing, so it is as if the <em>al-Hamd</em> occurs due to something in return, for that which has been rendered to the slave of Allaah at the time of saying <em>al-Hamd</em>, so if the slave of Allaah mentions <em>al-Hamd</em> from his own self without any pushing factor to do so, nor for a new blessing (which Allaah has given him) then his reward is increased.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- From their virtues is: that they are a protection from the Hell-Fire for the one who says them and they will come as a savior on the Day of Judgement for the one who says them and they will precede him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim collected in ‘al-Mustadrak’ and Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and others from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your protection.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah against an enemy that has arrived?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, but your protection from the Hell-Fire, say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) since indeed they will come on the Day of Judgement as saviours and preceding good actions and they are the lasting good deeds of the righteous.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim said: ‘This hadeeth is <em>Saheeh</em> upon conditions of Muslim and they did not collect it. Dhahabi agreed with al-Hakim. And it was authenticated by the <em>‘allaama</em> al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth includes an addition to the Ahadeeth which have preceded which is describing these statements that they are the lasting good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for </strong>[one’s] <strong>hope.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [18:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lasting good deeds are those deeds due to which their reward remains, and is continuous, and this is the best at what a slave of Allaah can expect and hope for and expect the best reward.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – And from its benefits is: that they make a curve around the <em>‘Arsh</em> of ar-Rahman and they have a buzzing sound like the buzzing of the bee, by which they mention /remember the one who said them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘Musnad’ of Imam Ahmad and Sunnan Ibn Majah and ‘al-Mustadrak’ by al-Hakim from Nu’man bin Basheer <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed what you remember/mention from the magnificence of Allaah is saying <em>Subhana Allaah, Allaahu Akbar, la illaah ila Allaah</em> and <em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, it curves around the ‘<em>Arsh</em>, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, which (mention/remember) its (companion/the one) who says it. Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Busseeri said in: ‘Zawaid Sunnan Ibn Majah: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>, its narrators of trustworthy, and it was authenticated by al-Hakim.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the benefit of this hadeeth is this great virtue, which is that these four statements curve around the  ‘<em>Arsh</em>, i.e. that they go around it, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, i.e. a sound which is similar to the sound of the bee and in doing so it remembers the person who said them, and those words are the greatest encouragement for <em>Dhikr</em> with these statements, this is why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said in this hadeeth: ‘Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From their excellence: that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that they are heavy on the scales.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee narrated in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and Ibn Hibban in his book called ‘Saheeh’ and al-Haakim and other than them from Abu Salma <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em> – and pointed with his five fingers – how heavy they are on the scale: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) and a righteous son that dies and his father is a Muslim and he benefits by him.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed[4] and the hadeeth has a support from the hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and al-Bazzar collected it in his ‘Musnad’ and said its <em>Isnaad</em> was <em>Hasan</em>. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the hadeeth: ‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em>’ this is a word, which is said when, being amazed by something and explaining its excellence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- From the excellence of these words is that for the slave of Allaah they are <em>Sadaqah </em>(giving charity) when he says each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is collected by Muslim in his ‘Saheeh’ from Abu Dharr <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: Some of the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah, the affluent have made off with the rewards, they pray as we pray they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the extra of their wealth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Has not Allah made things for you to give away in charity? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Every <em>Tasbihah</em> (saying: <em>Subhana Allaah</em>) is a charity, every <em>Takbirah </em>(saying: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) is a charity, every <em>Tahmidah</em> (saying: <em>al-Hamdu lillaah</em>) is a charity, and every <em>Tahlilah</em> (saying: <em>la illaah ila Allaah</em>) is a charity, to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity, and in having relations with your wife is a charity.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his desire (with his wife) will he have some reward for that?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not think that if he were to act upon it unlawfully he would be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poor people thought that there was no <em>Sadaqah</em> except by giving money, and they were incapable of doing that, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed them that all types of good actions and being good is <em>Sadaqah</em>, and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that at the head of good actions are these four statements ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – From the excellence of these statements is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> made these statements in place of the Noble Qur’aan for the one who truly cannot read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Dawood, Nisa’aee, Daraqutni and other than them from Ibn Abee Awfa <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah indeed I cannot learn the Qur’aan, so teach me something that will give me a reward.’ He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar wa La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin said: ‘like this – and he closed his hand – and said: This is for Allaah, what is for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin took them [this supplication] and closed the palm of his hand. The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for this person then he has filled his two hands with goodness.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Muhaddith</em> Abu Tayyib al-Atheem ‘Abbadi said in his comments on Sunnan Daraqutni its Isnad is Saheeh and Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said its <em>Sanad</em> is <em>Hasan</em>.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the virtues mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah regarding these four statements.  There are specific virtues for every one of these statements. Whoever reflects upon these preceding virtues finds that they are very great, and show the great status of these statements and their lofty status and their many benefits and their advantages upon the believer, the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps the secret to this great excellence – and Allaah knows best – is what has been mentioned by some of the people of knowledge, which is that the Names of Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – are all incorporated in these four statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for what is embodied in ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>’ is the Name of Allaah which show purity like <em>al-Qudoos </em>(The Holy) and <em>as-Salaam</em> (The Source of Peace).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>’ then it is comprises and affirms the different types of perfection for Allaah –<em>Tabaraka</em> – in His Names and His Attributes.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ then it contains the Magnificence of Allaah and regarding Him as Great, and that none can enumerate praise upon Him, so whoever this possesses, then, He is the One Who is worthy of worship, which means that there is none worthy of worship except Him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, look how great these statements are, and how magnificent their matter is, and how great is the result of the good for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He gives us the capability to observe these statements and to be continuous upon them, and makes us from its people, those whose tongues are moist with remembering them, indeed Allaah is The Protector of that and He is The Capable One.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kissing the Black Stone and Touching the<em>Yemeni</em> Corner [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What preceded was a discussion of the excellence of <em>Tawaaf</em> of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, the great act of worship and important act of obedience which is a pillar from the pillars of <em>Hajj</em> and <em>Umrah</em> and that it is prescribed for this one place only, as Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; and circumambulate the Ancient House (the <em>Ka’ba</em> at Makkah). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not permissible to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of domes, graves, tombs or other things; since these matters clash with the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> and they oppose the reality of<em>Tawheed</em>, because it involves associating and equating the created with The Creator <em>-Subhanahu</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion of a part of this issue, with a brief explanation, has already preceded.  As for what we will discuss here, by Allaah’s permission, regarding another lesson and benefit for the Muslim is what happens when he reaches the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>to perform <em>Tawaaf</em> of it.  It is legislated at this place to kiss the black stone and touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. There are very many proofs which explain the legality of it and show that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did this when he came to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattab <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said : <strong>‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he came to Makkah.  He touched the black corner (the black stone) at the beginning of his <em>Tawaaf</em> and he would jog the first three of the seven circuits</strong>.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim in the hadeeth of Jaabir bin AbdAllaah, who said that: <strong>‘When the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came to Makkah he entered the <em>Masjid</em> and touched the stone, he then began from the right hand side.  He jogged for three circuits and walked for four………..’</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslims also kiss the stone imitating the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, following his guidance and adhering to his Sunnah; rejecting any belief that the Black Stone could bring benefit or harm or give or withhold.  This is why the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>-RadiAllaahu anhu- </em>said, as he kissed the Black stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed I  know that you are a stone and you cannot cause benefit or harm.  If it were not that I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>kiss you, I would not have kissed you.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and  Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Verily, Umar said this because the people had newly entered Islaam after having left the worship of idols.  So Umar feared that some of the ignorant people would take the act of touching of the stone to signify glorification of stones or rocks as had been the practice of previous Arabs in times of ignorance.  Umar intended to teach the people that he only touched this stone imitating the action of the Messenger of Allaah, not because the stone itself caused harm or benefit, which they had previously believed about their idols.’</strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Saeed that Alee, when Umar said this, responded by saying. ‘Indeed it does harm and benefit’ and went on to mention how Allaah took covenants from the sons of Aadam and they were written upon parchement which were devoured by the stone.  He continued, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The black Stone will be brought on the Day of Judgment, it will have a tongue and it will testify for those upon <em>Tawheed</em> who touched it.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, this narration is not established from the Ameer ul-Mumineen, Alee bin Abu Taalib.  Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Fath ul-Bari: ‘In its chain is Abu Haroon al-Abdee and he is very weak.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haroon, the narrator of this narration is <em>Matrook</em> Hadeeth (his narrations are not accepted) according to the people of knowledge, some even call him a liar! an-Nisaee mentions that he is ‘<em>Matrook al-Hadeeth’</em>.  Hamaad Ibn Zayd said ‘Abu Haroon al-Abdee is a liar, in the morning he says one thing and  in the evening another!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Jawzajani said of him ‘a slandering liar’ and Ibn Hibban said of him ‘I used to narrate from Abu Saeed that which was not narrated by him. It is not permissible to write his hadeeth except from the standpoint of amazement!!’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can anyone support this narration if this, according to the people of knowledge, is the state of the narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus what is prescribed is kissing of the Black stone only and if you cannot do so then touching it.  If it is not possible to kiss or touch it then pointing to it is sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also legislated to touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner, as found in the two authentic books.  On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>–RadiAllaahu anhu-</em>  ‘I did not see the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> touch any part of the House except the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies that it is not legislated to touch any part of the House other than the two<em>Yemeni</em> corners, namely the Black stone and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘No corners other than the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners are to be touched and not the <em>Shami</em> corners.  The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> specifically touched them because they are from the foundations laid by Ibraheem whilst the other corners are from inside the House.  Thus the Black stone is touched and kissed and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner is touched but not kissed.  The remaining two corners are not touched or kissed. <em>Al-Istislaam</em> is to touch with the hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the remaining parts of the House and the Station of Ibraheem, the entire<em>masjid</em> and its walls, graves of Prophets and righteous people, such as the house of our Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, the cave of Ibraheem, the place in which our Prophet used to pray in and other places such as the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people and the stone in Bait al-Maqdis, then none of these are to be touched or kissed and the Imaams are all in agreement on this.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are great lessons and benefits which the Muslim derives from the fact that touching and kissing is only legislated at the above-mentioned specific place.  The evidence does not allow these acts to be performed at other than these two places.  Thus the Muslim does this in obedience to Allaah and imitating His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  The Muslim does not believe that in doing this (i.e. touching/kissing) he will receive any benefit or ward off any harm, as in the preceding explanation of the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin Khattab, where he kissed the Black stone and said as much in front of the people in order to teach and guide them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As previous texts have illustrated, touching or kissing the walls of the <em>Ka’ba</em> at other than the <em>Yemeni</em> corners or the Black stone is not from the Sunnah.  The texts show that touching or kissing the station of Ibraheem is, likewise, not from the Sunnah as nothing regarding this has been narrated from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it (i.e. touching/kissing) is not permissible with the <em>Ka’bah</em> itself -whose sacredness over all other <em>Masajid</em> and places is well-known- then it is not permissible at the Station of Ibraeem, about which Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ مُصَلّٗىۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And take the <em>Maqaam </em>(place) of Ibraheem [or the stone on which Ibraheem stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah] as a place of prayer&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though it is known that there is the Station of Ibraheem in Shaam, and other places, along with the other places of the Prophets lesser than this one, Allaah has only ordered us to take this particular, one station as a place of prayer.  Yet even so, we are not allowed to touch it or kiss it, as there is no evidence to sanction such an action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Know! That the rest of places cannot be made places of prayer nor can you touch or kiss any of them.  In fact there is no one thing on the face of this earth other than the Black stone that it has been made allowed to kiss.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those ignorant people -who encourage one another to gather around shrines and tombs etc- they kiss, rub and touch them.  They seek blessings from them and request their help and aid.  All of this has nothing at all to do with the <em>Deen</em>.  On the contrary, it is clear misguidance and a great lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘As for touching/rubbing a grave, regardless of whose it is, kissing it or placing one’s cheek upon it then this is prohibited by the consensus of the Muslims, even if they were the graves of the Prophets.  Neither anyone from the Salaf of this <em>Ummah</em> nor from the Imaams did it, rather this is from<em>Shirk</em>.’[10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawwaf of the House of Allaah al-Haraam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great lessons that benefits the pilgrim is when he reaches the Ancient House and carries out that great act of worship which is: <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>.  He sees all those pilgrims performing <em>Tawwaf</em> in obedience to Allaah and fulfilling His command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefits him in this situation is that which is well-known; the important state and noble value of this worship and the great intensity with which it enters the hearts of the believers.  This is especially so when the large masses of believers are all dressed in one type of clothing and are of uniform appearance, circling the House of Allaah, saying: ‘SubhanAllaah, La illaah ill Allaah and Allaahu Akbar’ (Far is Allaah from imperfection, There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and Allaah is the Greatest), supplicating to their Noble Lord, beseeching Him for success, asking of Him and turning to Him in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every single one of them is making a <em>Tawwaf</em> of seven circuits, all of them beginning at the black stone and ending at it and this is what the <em>Tawwaf</em> is: going around the <em>Ka’ba</em>seven times with the intention of <em>Tawwaf</em>, in worship of Allaah, starting with the black stone and ending at it, with the <em>Ka’ba</em> on their left hand side.  The Muslims do this in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and, for each person, the level of perfection for this act of worship is the equivalent to how much he followed the Noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawwaf</em> is the first action a Muslim does when he reaches Makkah.  It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the first action the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> performed when he reached Makkah was that he made <em>Wudhoo</em>, then he made the <em>Tawwaf</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book on the authority of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu – </em>who described the <em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…until we came to the House with the Prophet, where he touched the corner (black stone), then briskly walked the first three circuits and calmly walked four circuits.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> ‘that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> if he made<em>Tawwaf</em> in the <em>Hajj</em> or <em>Umrah</em>, the first thing he would begin with was walking briskly for three circuits and walking the remaining four normally.  Then, he prostrated twice (i.e. he prayed two <em>rakahs</em>) and, next, walked between as-Safa and al-Marwah.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences in the Book and the Sunnah showing the legislation of <em>Tawwaf </em>of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em> are numerous and there are multiple narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>. </em> This is proof that this action brings one closer to Allaah and it is obedience from Allaah’s slaves that He loves.  He has legislated it for them and commanded them with it, urged them to carry it out and made it a rite from the rites whereby His House <em>al-Haraam</em> is intended as He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah appointed His Prophet and friend, Ibraheem, along with his son Ismaeel, the Prophet of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, to sanctify the House, build its foundations and prepare it for those who would perform <em>Tawwaf</em>, stand up for prayer, make <em>Rukoo</em> and make <em>Sujood</em>, Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَعَهِدۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡعَٰكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;and We commanded Ibraheem and Isma’eel that they should purify My House (the Ka’bahat Makkah) for those who are circumbulating it, staying (in it i.e. in <em>I’tikâf</em>), bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer) &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ&#x200d;ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): “Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow and prostrate (in prayer)”&gt;&gt;[Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear from what has preceded that <em>Tawwaf</em> of the Ancient House is a noble act of worship and great act of obedience that Allaah loves from His slaves.  He has legislated it and ordained it for them.  He has prepared a great reward and many gains for those performing the <em>Tawwaf</em>.  <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House is a pillar from the pillars of<em>Hajj</em>, just as it is also a pillar from the pillars of <em>Umrah</em>.  This shows the great importance and high status of the <em>Tawwaf</em> with Allaah; since neither the <em>Hajj</em> nor the<em>Umrah</em> can be complete without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, in this great act, the Muslim learns great lessons and attains significant benefits, which is that this significant act of worship – by which I mean the <em>Tawwaf</em> – was legislated for this place alone, around the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, as preceding texts from the Book and Sunnah have shown and there are many other texts as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the Muslim comes to know that making <em>Tawwaf</em> in any place of the world other than this place is not legislated and there is nothing that proves its legislation.  Rather it is misguidance and false to make the houses of the creation equal with the House of the Creator; that place that He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> commanded to be established for His remembrance, obedience and to be faced in His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> worship.  There is no difference amongst the people of knowledge regarding the futility of making <em>Tawwaf</em>in any area or location other than the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it  is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaf</em> around domed shrines or graves, nor around tombs, trees, stones or anything else, and there are many, many narrations from the people of knowledge regarding this.  Perhaps, if time allows, I will mention some of their statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book ‘al-Majmoo Sharh al-Muhadhib’: ‘and it is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaaf</em> of his grave <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues after mentioning some points: ‘A person should not be deceived by many of the common people performing this <em>Tawwaf</em> because following the Sunnah and performing an action is only done by following the <em>Ahaadeeth</em> and the sayings of the scholars; no attention is paid to the innovations and ignorance of the common people or other then them.  It is affirmed in the two authentic books on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-RadiAllaah anha</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the narration of Muslim :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action that we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not frequent my grave, and send prayers upon me, as your prayers reach me from wherever you are.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Aboo Dawood with an authentic chain,[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said the meaning of which is : ‘Follow the paths of guidance and you will not be harmed due to being a small number of followers.  Beware of the paths of misguidance and do not be deceived by the large number of ruined ones.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever thinks that wiping his hands on graves and shrines, and other things similar to this, is more effective for receipt of blessings then this is from his ignorance and negligence; because receiving blessings can only be by way of that which is in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em>, and how can good be achieved by opposing that which is correct.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :  ‘And Indeed the Muslims are agreed that it is not legislated to make the <em>Tawaaf</em> except of <em>Bait-ul-Mamoor</em>.  It is not allowed to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the rock of Bait ul-Maqdis, nor of the Prophet’s house <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, nor of the dome which is in the mountain of ‘Arafat, nor in any other place.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said : ‘There is no place on earth like the <em>Ka’ba</em> where you can make <em>Tawaaf</em>.  Whoever believes that making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> is legislated, then that is a worse evil than the one who believes that it is permissible to pray facing other than the <em>Ka’ba</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed facing Bait ul- Maqdis for eighteen months when he first migrated from Makkah to Madina.  That was the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims for that period, then Allaah changed the<em>Qiblah</em> to the <em>Ka’ba</em> and revealed this in the Qur’aan as is mentioned in Sooratul Baqaraah.  The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed towards the <em>Ka’ba</em> and so it became a <em>Qiblah</em>.  It is the <em>Qiblah</em> of Ibraheem and other than him, from the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever today takes the rock as a <em>Qiblah</em> and prays facing it then he is a disbeliever, an apostate and he is made to repent- so he either repents or he is killed.  This is even though it used to be a <em>Qiblah</em> but has since been abrogated.  So what is the condition of one who takes it as a place for <em>Tawaaf</em>, just as one would make <em>Tawaaf</em>of the <em>Ka’ba</em>?  Making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> has not been legislated by Allaah in any way whatsoever……….’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, with this research mentioned by Imaam an-Nawawee, Shaykh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and other then them from amongst the people of knowledge, the severe evil and danger of making <em>Tawaaf</em> of any place other than the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>&#8211; which Allaah gave permission to make <em>Tawaaf</em> around- becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as what some of the ignorant people do where they make <em>Tawaaf</em> around graves, domes, shrines or anything else like this, then none of this is from the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah; rather it is from the whisperings of the Shaytaan and the legislation of Iblees; if it is not, then where is it to be found in the Book and the Sunnah: ‘make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the grave of so-and-so’ or of the tomb of so-and-so’, or things of this nature?  Allaah is The Most High above what they describe and He is far from the imperfection of what they associate with Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the words in the proclamation relate to a very important matter and have a profound explanation.  We previously discussed the proof for the words of the<em>Talbiyaah</em> containing the implementation of <em>Tawheed</em> and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  There is no doubt that these are great words which comprise important meanings with distinguished aims and many benefits.  The people of knowledge have pointed out the great significance of these words and the magnitude of what they comprise, of benefits and gains.  The Imaam and great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned a complete section, giving an extended explanation and discussion of this, in his book ‘Tahdeeb as-Sunnan’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘And indeed the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consist of great principles and magnificent benefits…’  and he mentioned twenty one benefits.  Here I will summarise a number of these magnificent benefits extracted from the <em>Talbiyaah</em> and from what Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these benefits is:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Your saying: ‘Labbayk’ (here I am).  This includes the response to your supplication by The One supplicated to and the response to your call by The One called upon.  It is not correct linguistically or intellectually that you call someone who does not speak or that you supplicate to someone who cannot answer you, so in this is the affirmation of the attribute of Allaah’s Speech.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes love.  ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) is not said except to The One who is loved and glorified.  This is why it is said of its meaning: ‘I am directing myself towards You with what You love’, and it is said: a woman is beloved. i.e. beloved to her son.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> comprises an adherence to a continuous (<em>al-Uboodiyah</em>) worship, so this is why it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Iqamah</em> (establishment), i.e.: I am established on Your obedience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes humility and submissiveness, i.e. humility and more humility, in what they say: I am responding here in front of You, i.e. with humbleness and submissiveness.</li>
<li>It comprises <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), that is, it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Lubb</em> (the core) and it is something pure.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> are that:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It comprises an affirmation that Allaah, The Lord, hears; since it is impossible that a man will say ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) to someone who will not hear his supplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes coming closer to Allaah, since it is said: that the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-ilbaab</em> (establishing) and that is seeking nearness.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is used as a distinction between moving from one state to another and from one rite to another in <em>Ihraam</em>, just as the <em>Takbeer</em> (saying<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>) in the prayer is a cause for moving from one pillar of the prayer to another.  This is why it is the Sunnah to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> up until the start of the <em>Tawaaf</em> at which point you break off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Then (after that), the pilgrim again begins to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at ‘Arafat, then he breaks off the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  The pilgrim then resumes the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at Muzdalifah then he breaks off from it.  Then he makes the<em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stones the <em>Jamaraatul-‘Aqabah</em> (the Large Pillar) then he stops making <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Therefore, the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Hajj</em> and a (sign of) change in the actions of its rites.  So, when the pilgrim moves from one action to another action he says: ‘Labbayk Allaahumma Labbayk’, just as the one praying says ‘<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>’ when he moves from one act to another.  So, when he completes his rites, he breaks off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, just as the one praying says the <em>Tasleem</em> (saying salaams at the end of the prayer) which cuts him off from his <em>Takbeer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Tawheed</em> and the creed of Ibraheem – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, which is the spirit of <em>Hajj</em> and its purpose.  On the contrary, it is the spirit of all acts of worship and its purpose.  This is why the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is the key to this act of worship, wherewith a person enters into the <em>Hajj</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it contains the key to Paradise and the door of Islaam whereby Paradise and Islaam are entered. It is also the statement of <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> and the testification for Allaah that He has no partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that it includes the fact that all praise (<em>al-Hamd</em>) is for Allaah, which is the most beloved thing whereby a slave comes closer to Allaah.  It is the first thing that the people of Paradise will call with and ‘<em>al-Hamd</em>’ is the opening and completion of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it comprises the acknowledgement that all blessings belong to Allaah and this is why the word <em>an-Ni’ma</em> (الـنعـم) (the blessing) is in the definite form, meaning that it includes everything i.e. that all blessings are for You [O Allaah ] and You are The Lord of blessings and the One who gives blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its (benefits); the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes the acknowledgement that all the dominion belongs to Allaah Alone, thus there is, in actuality, no dominion for anyone other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from its benefits: The <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes a notification of the combination of <em>al-Mulk </em>(the dominion), <em>an-Ni’mah </em>(the blessings) and al-Hamd (the praise) and that all of these are for Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.  This is another type of praise for Allaah which is different to the praise which results from (only) one of any of these three, High attributes.  So combining the dominion, which constitutes capability, with the blessing- which constitutes the height of benefiting, doing good and mercy-, and the praise – which constitutes a general sublimity and honour which leads to loving Allaah- then this is a different type of praise and in it is a greatness and perfection and a glory which is better suited to Allaah and befitting for Him <em>–Subhanahu</em>.  So, when a slave  remembers Him and knows about his Lord then his heart is attracted to Allaah and turns towards Him, facing Him, professing all love for Him with that which is the reason for <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (worship) and its core.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits: the Prophet said, ‘The best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(There is none worthy of worship except Allaah Alone, He has no partner, He has the Dominion and for Him is the praise and He has the capability over everything.)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of these words exactly and they include the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the benefits: That the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> contain a refutation of everyone who negates Allaah’s Attributes and His <em>Tawheed</em>.  So the <em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> however diverse their sects and statements. The<em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the philosophers and whoever is affected by them, from amongst those who nullify Allaah’s Attributes connected to <em>al-Hamd</em> (all praise).  The <em>Talbiyaah</em> ends the sayings of the <em>Qadireeyah</em>,  who are called the <em>Majoos</em> (fire-worshippers) of this <em>Ummah</em>, those who separate the actions of His slaves- from amongst the Angels, <em>Jinn</em> and mankind- from the dominion of The Lord and His capability.  They do not affirm that Allaah has power over them, nor do they make Him the Creator of this power over them.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, whoever comes to know the meaning of  the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, testifies to them and truly believes in them, then he will be unlike all the sects of the Muattilah (those who nullify the attributes of Allaah.)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that repetition of the testification (<em>Shahaada</em>) in Allaah, ‘that He has no partner’, has a benefit which is that Allaah has informed him of the fact that He has no partner after the response to: ‘labbayk’ (Here I am), then he repeats it again after saying: ‘innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak’ (Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This section of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in praise, blessing or dominion whereas the first part consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in His response to this call (i.e. the <em>Talbiyaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ قَآئِمَۢا بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allah bears witness that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>Lâ ilâh illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of this Ayaah Allaah tells us that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him, which is incorporated into His testimony (<em>la ilaha ill Allaah</em>) along with the testimony of the Angels and the people of knowledge, this is what has been attested to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah informs us that He maintains with justice and that He is just, then repeats the testification that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him along with His maintainingeverything with justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just a number of great benefits and the precious harvest acquired from this distinguished statement, the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These benefits, without doubt, indicate the importance of concern for understanding the meaning of this statement and that if the slave of Allaah has correct concern for it then this will help him to perform this worship in the best and most correct way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Guidance of the </strong><strong>Proclamation</strong><strong> is Warning Against <em>Shirk</em></strong><strong><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has preceded is the explanation of the excellence of the proclamation (<em>Talbiyaah</em>) and that it comprises the proclamation of Allaah’s Tawheed and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  This is why the great Companion Jabir bin Abdullaah <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> mentioned the<em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet as is described in Saheeh Muslim by saying: ‘Then he made the proclamation with <em>Tawheed</em>, Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> described this statement as a proclamation with <em>Tawheed</em>; because in it is sincerity for Allaah and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  This also shows us that these words, by which I mean the words of the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, are not mere words which do not suggest any meaning, but rather they have a great meaning and a deep significance and it is none other than the spirit of this <em>Deen</em>, its foundation and the origin upon which the Tawheed of Allaah Ta’ala is built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is indeed an obligation on everyone who proclaims these great words that he brings to mind what these words suggest, from their meanings.  Also, that one knows what they contain of evidence; so that one can be truthful in  one’s proclamation and so that, due to this, one’s speech can be in conformity with the reality of one’s situation, whereby one can hold on to <em>Tawheed</em>, preserving it, observing its rights, keeping away completely from that which cancels out <em>Tawheed</em> and that which opposes it from <em>Shirk</em> and setting up equals unto Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not ask, except from Allaah, and aid is not sought except from Allaah and do not rely, except upon Allaah, do not request aid, help or victory except from Allaah and do not direct any aspect of worship except to Allaah Alone, He in Whose Hand is bestowing and withholding, taking and (giving openly), benefit and harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أَمَّن يُجِيبُ ٱلۡمُضۡطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكۡشِفُ ٱلسُّوٓءَ وَيَجۡعَلُكُمۡ خُلَفَآءَ ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ أَءِلَٰهٞ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِۚ قَلِيلٗا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him and Who removes the evil and makes you inheritors of the earth, generation after generation.  Is there any god with Allaah? Little is it that you remember! &gt;&gt;[al-Naml : 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim says in his proclamation : ‘You have no partner’ then it is obligatory upon him to have knowledge about the reality of <em>Shirk</em>, recognising its danger, and being completely wary of falling into it or any of its causes, means and ways; since it is the greatest of sins by which Allaah is disobeyed.  Due to this, the punishments that are levelled for <em>Shirk</em> in this world and the Hereafter are not the same as those levelled for any other sin, by which the blood and wealth of the people become lawful and their women and children become prisoners, such that there is no forgiveness for a person for his sins except by repenting from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰٓ إِثۡمًا عَظِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلَۢا بَعِيدًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Verily! Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, has indeed strayed far away. &gt;&gt;[Nisa:116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّهُۥ مَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيۡهِ ٱلۡجَنَّةَ وَمَأۡوَىٰهُ ٱلنَّارُۖ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنۡ أَنصَارٖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;  Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him and the Fire will be his abode.  And for the <em>Zalimoon</em>(polytheists and wrong­doers) there are no helpers.&gt;&gt; [Maida:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَقَدۡ أُوحِيَ إِلَيۡكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبۡلِكَ لَئِنۡ أَشۡرَكۡتَ لَيَحۡبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلۡخَٰسِرِينَ ٦٥ بَلِ<br />
ٱللَّهَ فَٱعۡبُدۡ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ ٦٦</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those (Allaah’s Messengers) before you: ‘If you join others in worship with Allaah, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.’ Nay! But worship Allaah (Alone and none else), and be among the grateful. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are very many <em>Ayaat</em> with these meanings in the Noble Qur’aan.  Allaah warns His slaves against committing <em>Shirk</em> with Him and He explains to them the extreme danger of Shirk, the magnitude of its foolishness and the evil consequence, in this world and the Hereafter, for the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the consequence of <em>Shirk</em> is evil, its result is grievous, its danger is immense and the one who commits it does not benefit anything after it except failure, deprivation, degradation and loss.  It is the greatest of sins by which Allaah is disobeyed, because it is the most oppressive of oppressions; since its meanings contain a belittling of the Lord of the worlds, diverting His absolute Right to someone else and equating someone else with Him.  This is because the one committing <em>Shirk</em> is contradicting the purpose of creation and Allaah’s command, negating it from every angle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shirk</em> is the height of opposition to the Lord of  the worlds and it is to be too arrogant to have obedience and humility for Him, because <em>Shirk</em> is to liken the creation to the Creator, the Most High and the Holy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can a person put someone else in the position of worship – one who does not possess the ability to harm or to bring about benefit, nor possesses death, nor life, nor can he resurrect the dead, let alone other than himself, – and liken (him) to The One Who owns all of the creation and the dominion, in Whose Hands is all good and all matters and to Whom all matters return?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever He wills exists and whatever He does not will does not exist.  There is none to prevent what He gives and there is none to give what He prevents. He Who, if He opens up mercy for the people there is none to hold it back and whatever He withholds, then there is none that can send it after Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the obligation on every Muslim is that he warns most sternly against <em>Shirk</em> and that he is extremely wary of falling into it. We have the Prophet of Allaah and His friend Ibraheem <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying in his supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱجۡنُبۡنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعۡبُدَ ٱلۡأَصۡنَامَ ٣٥ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضۡلَلۡنَ كَثِيرٗا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. &gt;&gt; [Ibraheem: 35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Ibraheem <em>–alayhis Salaam- </em>feared this and supplicated to his Lord that He protect him and his offspring from worshipping idols.  So, if Ibraheem <em>al-Khaleel</em> <em>–alayhis Salaam-</em> used to ask Allaah to keep him and his offspring away from worshipping idols, then what do you think about anyone other than him?  As Ibraheem at-Taymee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said : ‘Who can feel safe from trial after Ibraheem ?’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the heart which is alive and fearful of <em>Shirk</em> is extremely wary of it and is continuously and ceaselessly asking Allaah to be excepted from falling into it.  This then requires that the believing slave must be knowledgeable about the reality of<em>Shirk</em> and its causes, its principles and its various types; so as not to fall into it.  This is why Hudayfah bin al-Yaman <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> said : ‘The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> about  good, but I used to ask him about evil fearing that I would fall into it.’  Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim in their authentic collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because for the one who knows nothing but good, then perhaps evil may come to him but he doesn’t know that it is evil.  So, either he will fall into it or he will not be able to reject it, unlike the one who knows about it, who will be able to reject it; so this is why Umar bin al-Khattab <em>-radhiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> said : ‘Indeed the yoke of Islaam will be taken apart peice by piece if the one raised in Islaam does not know about the times of ignorance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being far removed from all types of <em>Shirk</em> whilst having sincerity of <em>Tawheed</em> for Allaah is the foundation upon which it is obligatory to build all acts of obedience, those which bring the slave closer to Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> and this includes the <em>Hajj</em> and other acts of obedience. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said in <em>Sooratul Hajj</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">٢٦ وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />

فَٱجۡتَنِبُواْ ٱلرِّجۡسَ مِنَ ٱلۡأَوۡثَٰنِ وَٱجۡتَنِبُواْ قَوۡلَ ٱلزُّورِ  حُنَفَآءَ لِلَّهِ غَيۡرَ مُشۡرِكِينَ بِهِۦۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخۡطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيۡرُ أَوۡ تَهۡوِي بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٖ سَحِيقٖ٣٠</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj </em>(pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform <em>Hajj</em>). That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor who have a very hard time. Then let them complete the prescribed duties for them, and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House (the Ka’bah at Makkah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">That (duties of Hajj is the obligation that mankind owes to Allaah), and whoever honours the sacred things of Allah, then that is better for him with his Lord. The cattle are lawful to you, except those (that will be) mentioned to you (as exceptions). So shun the abomination (worshipping) of idols and shun lying speech (false statements)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">To worship none but Allaah, not associating partners unto Him and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far-off place. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj : 27-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah warns against <em>Shirk</em> in these Noble <em>Ayaat</em>, in context of the <em>Hajj</em>, and commands keeping away from <em>Shirk</em> and He explains the ugliness of <em>Shirk</em> and its evil consequences.  The one who does <em>Shirk</em>, it is as if he has fallen from the sky and the birds have snatched him or the wind has thrown him to a far-off place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as was mentioned before these <em>Ayaat</em>, Allaah <em>–Subhanahu-</em> ordered His Prophet Ibraheem <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>to sanctify the House after Allaah had shown him a place for it, and Allaah prohibited him from making <em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, as He <em>–Subhanahu-</em> says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ&#x200d;ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the<em>Ka’bah</em> at Makkah) (saying): ‘Do not Associate anything (in worship) with Me and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer and those who bow and make prostration (in prayer);’ &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These <em>Ayaat</em>, which are regarding <em>Hajj</em>, are surrounded by a warning against <em>Shirk</em>, a prohibition of it and an explanation of its evil consequences.  These <em>Ayaat</em> also demonstrate a great proof illustrating the ugliness of <em>Shirk</em> and its great danger.  May Allaah protect myself and yourselves from it and may He provide us with sincerity in our speech and actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proclamation of Tawheed is an Evidence of ‘Aqeedah</strong><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the most significant of the great lessons which benefits the Muslim in his <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em> is the obligation to have sincerity in all worship for Allaah Alone Who has no partners. So when the Muslim begins his <em>Hajj</em>, the first thing that he begins with is the proclamation of <em>Tawheed</em> and rejection of <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah), when he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ , لَبَّيْكَ لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ , إنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ ، لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">labbaykallaahumma labbaika, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeats it and raises his voice with it whilst, at the same time, he is conscious of and feels what this proclamation indicates: the obligation to single out Allaah Alone with worship and keeping far away from <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah is Alone in His favours and His giving, having no partners, then likewise He is Alone in His <em>Tawheed</em> not having any equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one is supplicated to except Allaah, none is relied upon except Allaah, none is sought for aid except Allaah nor is any type of the different aspects of worship directed to anyone except Allaah. Just as the slave is required to make his intention for the <em>Hajj</em>completely for Allaah Alone, then in the same way he is required to make his intention in all the worship he performs and in all the acts of obedience by which he becomes closer to Allaah, for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah then he has committed<em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, The Great, and he has suffered a clear loss, nullified his actions and Allaah will not accept his actions from him, neither his optional actions nor his obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam came with this great proclamation, the proclamation of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah and distancing oneself from all types of<em>Shirk</em> large or small, minor or major.  Whereas the <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists), the worshippers of idols and statues, used to make the declaration to enter into their<em>Ihraam</em> for <em>Hajj</em> with <em>Shirk</em> and abuse, they would say in their <em>Talbeeyaah</em>(proclamation):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the proclamation, they included their false gods along with Allaah and they place – what they claim for their false gods – in the Hands of Allaah and this is the meaning of the saying of Allaah about them in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَا يُؤۡمِنُ أَكۡثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشۡرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And most of them believe not in Allaah except that they attribute partners unto Him&gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that most of them do not believe in Allaah, that He is The Creator, The Provider and The Disposer except that they associate partners with Him in worship – with idols who do not possess anything and statues that do not benefit or bring harm, nor do they give anything or prevent harm, rather they do not possess anything at all for themselves, let alone possess anything for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu   – </em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is from their <em>Eemaan</em>, that if it is said to them: ‘Who created the sky?’ ‘Who created the earth?’ and ‘Who created the mountains?’ They would say ‘Allaah’ yet they are still<em>Mushrikoon</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ikrimaa that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allaah. That is their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and yet they worship other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their <em>Eemaan</em> is their saying: Allaah is our Creator, He gives us provision and He takes our lives. So this is <em>Eemaan</em>, along with <em>Shirk</em> in their worship of other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Zayd who said: ‘There is no-one that worships someone along with Allaah except that he believes in Allaah, knows that Allaah is His lord and that Allaah is his Creator and his Provider, but along with this he commits <em>Shirk</em> with Him. Do you not see how Ibraheem said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَالَ أَفَرَءَيۡتُم مَّا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡبُدُونَ ٧٥ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلۡأَقۡدَمُونَ ٧٦ فَإِنَّهُمۡ عَدُوّٞ لِّيٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٧٧</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping – you and your ancient fathers? Verily they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds. &gt;&gt; [ash-Shoora:75-77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem <em>– alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> knew that they worshipped the Lord of the worlds along with those whom they used to worship.’ Then he said: there is none that commits <em>Shirk</em>except that he believes in Allaah, do you not see how the Arabs used to proclaim and say: ‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the <em>Mushrikoon</em> used to say.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Mushrikoon</em> at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to affirm that their Creator, Provider and The Disposer of their affairs was Allaah, but even with this affirmation they did not make the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah. Rather, they worshipped others along with Him in their worshipping of trees, stones and idols, besides other things. Allaah made this matter clear and explained it in many places in the Noble Qur’aan, such as His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤۡفَكُونَ ٦١</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ They will surely reply ‘Allaah’. How then are they deviating (as disbelievers)? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Ankabut: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat</em> with this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Katheer <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book of <em>Tafseer</em>: ‘Allaah Ta’ala speaks, affirming that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him- because the<em>Mushrikeen</em> who worship Him, worship others along with Him- they acknowledge that He is Independent in His creation of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the change of the night and day and that He is The Creator and The Provider for His slaves, The One Who determines their different times of death, their different types of provision and the contrast between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, from amongst them, are the rich and the poor and He knows best that which is befitting for everyone amongst them, he who deserves to be rich and he who deserves to be poor. It is mentioned that He is Independent in creating things and He is Alone in organising the creation.  So, if this is the case, then why is someone other than Him relied upon? Since He is Alone in possessing everything then He should be the only One worshipped. Many times Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> establishes His status as being worthy of being worshipped due to the recognition of the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship. The<em>Mushrikoon</em> used to acknowledge this as they used to say in their proclamation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, except for the partner who is Yours, whom You possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why is someone else relied upon?[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many places in the noble Qur’aan which mention this meaning of establishing proof against the <em>Kuffar</em> of their obligation to have <em>Tawheed</em> of Him in His worship and making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him due to their acknowledgement of the Lordship of Allaah <em>–Jala wa Oola</em>. Due to this, Allaah addresses them regarding the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship with a rhetorical question. So, if they affirm His Lordship, He uses this as an evidence against them, that He is The One Who deserves to be worshipped Alone and He rebukes them, rejecting their association of others with Him, even though they acknowledge that He Alone is The Lord; because whoever acknowledges that He Alone is The Lord then it necessitates that all worship is performed sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it becomes clear that acknowledging that Allaah is The Creator, The Provider, The Benefactor, The One who controls and The Disposer of the affairs of the creation, (then this) is not sufficient for the (establishment of the) <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and it does not save anyone from the punishment of Allaah on the Day of Judgement, unless all worship is sincerely for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not accept the <em>Tawheed</em> of Lordship from His slaves unless they single Him out Alone in the <em>Tawheed</em> of <em>Ibaadah</em> (worship), such that they do not take an equal with Him, nor do they supplicate to anyone along with Him, nor do they rely upon anyone except Him, nor do they direct any form of worship to other than Him <em>-Subhanahu</em>, so just as He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> is The Only One to create then He is worshipped Alone with all types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah Ta’ala said to those who turned their worship to other than Him, even though they knew that He is their Creator and Provider:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادٗا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ ٢٢</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadiAllaah anhu –</em> said: ‘i.e. Do not associate others with Allaah assigning equals to Him, who do not bring any benefit, nor do they harm while you know that you have no Lord who provides for you other than Him. Indeed you have come to know that what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>called you to, of Allaah’s <em>Tawheed</em>, then that is the truth wherein there is no doubt.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: ‘You know that Allaah created you and He created the Heavens and the earth, then you ascribe equals unto Him.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the blessing upon the <em>Ummah</em> of Islaam is great; their being guided to the<em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah in His Lordship, worship and His Names and Attributes. The blessing of Allaah upon the Muslims is great in their being capable of proclaiming Allaah’s<em>Tawheed</em>, since others besides them proclaim <em>Shirk</em> and set up equals with Him.  So, for Allaah belongs the praise, <em>-Subhanahu-</em> for giving the ability, His blessings and guidance and to Him belong many good and blessed praises, such as our Noble Lord loves and is pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of  a Number of Benefits of Hajj</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As was mentioned in the previous discussion of the excellence of <em>Hajj</em> and its high stature, <em>Hajj</em> is from amongst the most distinguished acts of worship and the greatest means of seeking closeness to Allaah.  It is a pillar from the great pillars of Islaam and it is a principle from the strong foundations upon which Islaam stands and is built as was indicated previously when we mentioned the worldly and religious virtues and benefits of the <em>Hajj</em>, which a person can neither enumerate, nor limit nor is a person able to count them, and in this regard Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says in the Noble Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the <em>Hajj</em> is full of religious and worldly benefits, and the arabic letter Laam [ل ] in the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them……&gt;&gt; is the arabic letter <em>Laam</em> which is used for purpose and reason which, here, is connected to the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel………&gt;&gt;, which means; if the <em>Hajj</em> is proclaimed they will come to you walking and riding so that they can witness benefits; i.e. they can be present for their benefits, and the meaning of ‘be present’ is that they can achieve these benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying &lt;&lt; منافع – benefits&gt;&gt; is the plural of &lt;&lt;منفعة – benefit &gt;&gt;, because Allaah intended benefits from this specific act of worship, religious and worldly benefits, which are not found in any other act of worship which is done together, communally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumma-</em> who said regarding the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefits in the world and benefits in the Hereafter.  As for benefits of the Hereafter then it is the pleasure of Allaah- <em>Azza wa Jal-</em> and as for benefits of the world then it is what they acquire of the meat of the goat and the slaughtered animals and business.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazzaq narrated on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah- </em>regarding the statement of Allaah &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt; he said: ‘Business and that which is pleasing to Allaah from the matters of the world and the Hereafter.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabari narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah-</em> &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them.&gt;&gt;  He said: ‘The reward in the Hereafter and business in the worldly life.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the benefits which the pilgrims achieve and encounter in their <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em>, are many and varied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Religious benefits of distinguished acts of worship and momentous acts of obedience which cannot take place except in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Worldly benefits of profits and achieving worldly gains, as Allaah mentions in the context of the <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>Hajj</em> in <em>Soorah</em> al-Baqarah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood and others on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadhiAllaah anhu  &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They used to be frightened to buy and sell and to conduct business during the prohibited season and during the <em>Hajj </em>because they would say ‘These are the days of<em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance).’ Then Allaah revealed :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu-</em> that he said, regarding the meaning of this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no harm in you buying and selling before the <em>Ihraam</em> or after it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqitee <em>-Rahimullaahi-</em> said : ‘And the scholars of<em>Tafseer</em> are agreed on the meaning of the statement of Allaah : &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt; that there is no sin upon the person performing <em>Hajj</em> nor is there any harm if he desires to profit from business during the days of <em>Hajj</em> if this does not busy  him from performing the rituals of <em>Hajj</em>.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the worldly benefits for the people doing <em>Hajj</em> are what they gain from the sacrificial and slaughtered animals, as Allaah Ta’ala mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; In them (cattle offered for sacrifice) are benefits for you for an appointed term and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice unto the Ancient House &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further to that is what the pilgrim gains of religious benefits, which cannot be compared to the worldly benefits since, in the <em>Hajj</em>, there are great rewards and plentiful expiations, forgiveness of sins, cancellation of bad deeds and many other great religious benefits which cannot be counted- all of which the pilgrim attains if he has Taqwa of Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em> by fulfilling His commands and keeping away from His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What greater good can there be?  What can be more profitable than that the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> and he is as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin or mistake, as Allaah mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوۡمَيۡنِ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer chose in his <em>Tafseer</em> of this <em>Ayaah</em>, after mentioning the sayings of the people of knowledge, the saying, that its meaning is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So whosoever hastens the two days from the three days of Mina and he leaves on the second day, then there is no sin upon him since Allaah has purged him of his sins, if he had feared Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em>, avoided that which Allaah had ordered him to avoid, and done what Allaah had commanded him to do and had been obedient in performing the <em>Hajj</em> according to what Allaah had required from him, from His laws. Whosoever delays the <em>Hajj</em> until the third day ……..then there is no sin upon him, since Allaah has covered up what has preceded from his sins and crimes if he had <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah whilst carrying out the <em>Hajj</em> within its limits.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Jareer mentions some clear narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – with this meaning, and from them is his <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em> –</em> saying: ‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and does not commit intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns cleansed from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perform the <em>Hajj</em> and the <em>‘Umrah</em> regularly since they do indeed negate poverty and sins just as the bellows get rid of the filth from iron.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these texts show that if the pilgrim performs <em>Hajj</em> within its limits according to what Allaah commanded then he has become free from all his sins, as Allaah &#8211;<em>Jala wa ‘Ala</em> – says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; for the one who fears Allaah in his <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out the commands and keeping away from the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is a great virtue and an amazing benefit which the believing hearts hasten to receive and the truthful souls desire to achieve.  By Allaah how great are His virtues and how great are the benefits.  When the pilgrim returns to his country after having carried out his <em>Hajj</em> and having his sins forgiven, he is left pure and clean from his sins and bad deeds, just as the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin upon him nor any mistakes if he had <em>Taqwaa</em> of his Lord in his <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, from the great favours of the Lord – far is He from imperfection – and from His beautiful kindness to His pilgrim slaves, is that He boasts to His Angels about the pilgrims to His House <em>al-Haram</em> when they stand altogether on the plain of ‘Arafat and says: ‘Look at My slaves coming to Me from every deep valley with dishevelled hair, covered in dust and sacrificing , I take you as witnesses that I have indeed forgiven them.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it becomes clear that the pilgrim returns from his <em>Hajj</em> with the greatest of profits and the biggest of gains and it is none other than forgiveness from his Lord for his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after his <em>Hajj</em> he begins a new, righteous life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwaa</em>, filled with goodness, being upright and persistent in obedience, but achieving this reward is conditional on performing the <em>Hajj</em> correctly with sincerity and truthfulness and sincere repentance, coupled with avoiding anything of committing intercourse or disobedience to Allaah that cancels out the <em>Hajj</em>, as was mentioned earlier.  If he performs his <em>Hajj</em>like this, then it wipes out what was before it and the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> in a wonderful state, like the day his mother gave birth to him without any sin or mistakes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj &#8211; ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">An Explanation Concerning the <em>Hajj</em> being a Great Centre of Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the <em>Hajj</em> is from the best acts of obedience and from the most magnificent ways by which the Muslim seeks closeness to his Lord. Rather, it is an act from the acts of worship, which Allaah has made obligatory and has made one of the five pillars upon which the upright religion of Islaam rests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> explained this with his saying in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Islaam is built upon five: The testification that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, establishing the prayer, payment of the<em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> of the House.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligation of <em>Hajj</em> is established from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> in many ahaadeeth encouraging his <em>Ummah</em> to perform the <em>Hajj</em> and urging them to fulfil this great act of obedience. He explained the great rewards, the abundance of recompense and the forgiveness of sins they would profit from in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated in his authentic collection that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–</em> said to ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> when he became a Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Did you not know that accepting Islaam wipes out what was before it, migration (<em>Hijra</em>) wipes out that what was before it, and that the <em>Hajj</em> wipes out what was before it.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and neither commits intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns free from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em><em>that</em>the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The performance of <em>‘Umrah</em> is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous one and the reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger performed <em>Hajj</em> with the people in the tenth year of his prophetic <em>Hijra</em>(migration) where he practically demonstrated for his <em>Ummah</em> how to perform this great obligation and urged them to learn everything that came from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> of actions and sayings. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your <em>Hajj</em> rituals from me, perhaps I will not meet up with you after this year.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was called the <em>Hajjatul Widdah</em> (the farewell <em>Hajj</em>) and during it the following statement of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">ٱلۡيَوۡمَ أَكۡمَلۡتُ لَكُمۡ دِينَكُمۡ وَأَتۡمَمۡتُ عَلَيۡكُمۡ نِعۡمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلۡإِسۡلَٰمَ دِينٗاۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> [Soorah al-Ma’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is obligatory upon every Muslim who comes to perform this great act of obedience, to exert himself and endeavour completely to learn about the Prophet’s <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> guidance regarding the <em>Hajj</em> and how to perform its rituals, thereby following the Prophet’s methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also obligatory to tread along his path and imitate his way so that he can learn the rites from the Prophet and, therefore, accomplish the <em>Hajj</em> completely and with perfection since there is no way to perfect this act of obedience, nor any other act of obedience, except by following the traditions of the noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and by proceeding according to his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that every single Muslim on the face of the earth has his soul awakened in these blessed days where he desires to carry out this great act of worship, craving to fulfil this momentous ritual and loving to see the ancient House of Allaah, because indeed all the Muslims have a pledge to go to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, and this began when the Muslim ascribed himself to the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam. So, this pledge remains as long as his soul is in his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the child who is born into Islaam, one of the first things that is brought to his attention, from the obligations of Islaam, is that one of the five pillars is performing<em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the disbeliever then, when he accepts Islaam and testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, then one of the first obligations of Islaam that faces him, after the two testifications, are the rest of the remaining pillars of Islaam, and they are: establishing the prayer, the giving of the <em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar after the two testifications is establishing the five prayers. Allaah has obligated this upon His slaves in every day and night and has made facing the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, a condition for the correctness of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةٗ تَرۡضَىٰهَاۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ<br />
ٱلۡحَرَامِۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُۥۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Verily We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a <em>Qiblah</em> that shall please you, so turn in the direction of <em>Masjid al-Haram;</em>, and wherever you people are, turn your faces in prayer in that direction&gt;&gt; [Soorah al-Baqarah: 144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim’s connection to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram,</em> remains continuous in every day and night; he faces it, if he has the capability, in every prayer that he performs whether it is an obligatory or optional prayer and he also faces it to supplicate.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this fortified link, which is acquired by this connection between the heart of the Muslim and the House of His Lord, and this continuous persistence inevitably drive the Muslim to a pressing desire to direct oneself towards the Ancient House, to gratify the eyes by gazing at it and to perform the <em>Hajj</em> that Allaah has made binding upon the Muslim if he has the means to perform it. So, when the Muslim has the means to perform the <em>Hajj</em>, he hastens to it in order to carry out this obligation with a desire to behold the House which he faces in all his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">٩٦ فِيهِ ءَايَٰتُۢ بَيِّنَٰتٞ مَّقَامُ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; In it are manifest signs (for example), the place of Ibraheem&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah al-Imraan: 97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is an obligation upon you my brother pilgrim that you increase in your praise of Allaah for His great blessing upon you of giving you the capability to perform this act of obedience, of your arrival to accomplish this worship and of being honoured to be permitted to see the Ancient House of Allaah which is the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims from the east to the west of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should exert yourself in completing the actions of the <em>Hajj</em> in the best way, with all its conditions, without any transgression or shortcoming, without any negligence or excessiveness, but rather, it should be upon guidance, upright, on a straight path following your noble Messenger &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should be seeking, by this action of yours, the pleasure of your Lord, seeking to earn reward from Him, forgiveness for sins and then returning to your country after this blessed journey with your sins forgiven and having had your sacrifices accepted. Also, returning having had your good actions accepted and blessed and returning with a new, good life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwa</em>, full of goodness and steadfastness and beautified with eagerness and exerting oneself in obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Hajj </em>is a great opportunity to increase the provisions for the Hereafter with repentance to Allaah, turning repentantly to Him, drawing closer to Him in obedience and seeking His pleasure during the <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out its rituals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pilgrim has many opportunities to receive beneficial lessons, moving admonitions, important benefits and precious, ripe fruits in <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners beginning with the very first action of <em>Hajj</em> which the worshippers carry out at the meeqaat and ending with the last rite of <em>Hajj</em>, which is the <em>Tawaaf</em> of seven circuits, where the pilgrim bids farewell to the House of Allaah,the <em>Haram</em>. Truly, it is a great school of education and <em>Eemaan</em> from which the God-fearing believers graduate. So, they witness great benefits in their <em>Hajj</em>, various lessons and touching sermons by which the hearts are given life and <em>Eemaan</em> is strengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And proclaim to mankind the Hajj. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform Hajj). That they may witness things that are of benefit&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Hajj: 27 – 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefits of Hajj cannot be counted, its virtues cannot be thoroughly investigated, nor can its beneficial events and lessons be completely defined. We will stop regularly during this booklet to examine a good number of valuable lessons and tremendous benefits of performing Hajj to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haram</em> and all capability lies with Allaah Alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compilation of Tweets from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts About Allah&#8221; by Dawud Adib (hafidhahullah) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts of Allah is an enormous act of worship and has a lofty position for those seeking to get close to Allah. It is one of the obligations of Tawheed; in fact, the Tawheed of the slave will not be correct except by having good assumptions of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good assumptions of Allah brings about praiseworthy effects and beneficial fruits in this life and the next</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, “Three days before the Messenger (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) died he said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Do not allow anyone of you to die except that he is perfecting his assumptions about Allah.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side Benefit: The ‘Ulamaa` pay close attention to those statements and actions of the Prophet (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that happen close to his death by days, weeks or months because the revelation is about to cease</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah will produce good actions; and this comes from having knowledge of Allah &#8211; one is the result of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan al-Basree (rahimahullah) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, when the believer perfects his thoughts about his Rabb, he would have perfected his actions and the faajir is the one who has corrupted his thoughts of his Lord, so his actions will also be corrupted</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Deeply reflect upon this consistent, strong connection between having good thoughts of Allah and good actions. It is based upon having good knowledge of Allah, specifically about his Lofty Names and Perfect Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know the Name of Allah, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Ghaffaar</strong></span>, then you have to perfect your thoughts about Him when you make istighfaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you deeply ponder upon His Beautiful Name, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">At-Tawwaab</span></strong> and that Allah will accept the repentance of His servants and pardon them for their offences, then it is upon you to perfect your assumptions of Him, that He will accept your repentance regardless of what your offense is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If some of the calamities of this world or pain afflicts you, even some of those diseases that are called incurable or fatal, it is upon you to perfect your assumptions about Allah, that He is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaafee</strong></span> and there is no remedy or healing except His healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me; And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again)”</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa` :78-81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aayaat indicate that Ibraaheem (‘alayhis salaam) had good thoughts about Allah. He did not attribute becoming sick to Allah as he attributed creation, guidance and sustenance to Him. He did not say “when Allah makes me ill” &#8211; he attributed this to himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In your du&#8217;aa to Allah for the good things of this dunyaa and aakhirah, you must perfect your thoughts about Allah that He will answer you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”</span> [Soorah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge) I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.”</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah is from the most tremendous blessings and greatest bounties that Allah gives to whomever He wishes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Dunyaa (rahimahullah) said in &#8220;Having Good Thoughts AboutAllah&#8221;: &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I swear by The One Who there is none worthy of worship but Him. A believing slave has not been given anything better than having good assumptions about Allah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) said,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “And I swear by the One Who there is nothing worthy of worship but Him, that there is no slave who perfects his assumption of Allah except that Allah will give him what he assumed and all of that good is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that whoever is more knowledgeable of Allah will be the most fearing of Him and whoever is most fearing of Him will be foremost in acts of worship and will be furthest from acts of disobedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.” </span>[Soorah Faatir :28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, having good thoughts is constructed upon perfecting your knowledge and understanding of Allah. This produces good actions and obedience, and will be your share and portion of the People of Eemaan; this is a description of the People of Eemaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The munaafiqoon and mushrikoon have no share regarding having good thoughts of Allah. In fact, they have bad thoughts of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of nifaaq and kufr to have bad thoughts of Allah because those who have bad thoughts of Him are those who do not believe in Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And that He may punish the Munaafiqoon, men and women, and also the Mushrikoon men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allah for them is a disgraceful torment, and the Anger of Allah is upon them, and He has cursed them and prepared Hell for them and worst indeed is that destination.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Fath :6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the scholars have said that there is no punishment mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan more severe than that for having bad thoughts about Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have bad thoughts of Allah due to their disbelief in Allah, their corrupted &#8216;Aqeedah and the deviation in their hearts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These tremendous benefits were taken from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts of Allah&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq Ibn &#8216;Abdul Muhsin al-&#8216;Abbaad(hafidhahumullah)</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Keys of Good, by Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaq al-&#8216;Abbad, ibn Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin al-&#8216;Abbad al-Badr (hafidhahumullaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst people are those who are keys to good and closers of evil. There are also those who are &#8211; we seek refuge in Allaah &#8211; keys to evil and closers of good. This is according to their condition of good or evil. Every vessel will dispense what is present within it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recorded in Ibnu Majah as well as Ibn Abee &#8216;Asim in as-Sunnah, and other than them, on the authority of Anas ibnu Malik that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed from the people are people who are keys to open the good for the people, and to lock away the evil. And indeed from the people are people who are keys to lock away and block the good, and they open up the evil for the people. So Tooba (glad tidings; scholars have also defined this word Tooba to be a tree in Paradise) is for the one whom Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala places the keys of good at his hands. And woe be to the one whom Allaah has placed the keys of evil at his disposal.</span> &#8211; {Hasan hadeeth, Ibn Majah: 237; as-Sunnah by Ibn Abee &#8216;asim: 297}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Imaams of guidance, the callers to the Sunnah, the supports of the religion, and the carriers of knowledge &#8211; those who call the people to guidance and are patient upon harm, those who bring life to the dead by means of the Book of Allaah and bring sight to the blind by the light of Allaah &#8211; they are the keys to good.*</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam As-Sa&#8217;dee</strong> (rahimahullaah), describing The Keys to Good, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the most important factors is learning beneficial knowledge and spreading it</strong></span>. Verily, this is the key to all good. From this is enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with gentleness, kindness and wisdom. An example of this is a servant performing a good practice and starting a beneficial task in order that the people follow him in doing so. &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From Abee Hurayrah (radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever calls to guidance has a reward like the example of the reward of those who follow him, not decreasing their reward in any way. And whoever calls to misguidance has upon him the sin like the example of the sin of those who follow him, not decreasing their sin in anyway.&#8221;</span> Narrated by Muslim, no. 2674.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>giving valuable advice and sincerity in the religion, or in wordly affairs</strong></span>. Verily, those who advise are keys to good and blockers of evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam As-Sa&#8217;dee</strong> also mentioned those who are keys to good take advantage of the opportunity of gatherings by busying them with good &#8211; and away from evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the desire for good becomes the focal point of the individual, and his intention is determined on accomplishing his goal according to his ability, he seeks assistance from Allaah in fulfilling his goals, he approaches affairs in the correct manner and fashion and, as a result, he will continue to gain good and reap reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the opposite of this is lack of desire for good; much good escapes this person. If lack of sincerity and advice for others is coupled with this, and he doesn&#8217;t intend to benefit others in any fashion &#8211; in fact, he may actually desire to harm and deceive them to accomplish personal goals or corrupt beliefs &#8211; at that time, he has indeed come with the greatest means of [harm] and elimination of good. He has become one who deserves to be called &#8216;a key to evil&#8217; and a blocker of good. We seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of ourselves and of our actions. &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> Riyad u Nadirah: 1/512-513</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The author (Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaq al-&#8216;Abbad) commented in a footnote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opening of good is done by clarifying the good to mankind and calling them to it, encouraging them regarding it, causing a desire for it, and similar to this. As for opening of good, which is expanding one&#8217;s chest for good and success and accepting it, then this affair is solely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subsequently, the opening is of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>1- That which is done by way of the creation, and this is accomplished through propagation, guidance and clarification.</li>
<li>2- The second is by Allaah only, and this is accomplished through guidance, inspiration, and allowing to succeed.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Khutbah &#8211; Guidelines In Islam For The Woman</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This Friday Khutbah was given at Masjid At-Tawheed in Stone Mountain, GA.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was taken from one of the khutab of our noble sheikh <strong>Abdur-Razzaq ibn Abdil-Muhsin Al-Badr</strong>. You can find the original audio and transcription here:<a href="http://www.al-badr.net/web/index.php?page=lecture&amp;action=lecs&amp;category=23&amp;f=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">صيانة الإسلام للمرأة </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are beautiful guidelines that every Muslim woman should adhere to. They do not oppress her nor do they take her freedom, as some foolish people claim. Rather they are legislated by Allahu subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;aala to preserve and protect the precious and priceless gem that is the Muslim woman.</p>

<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed he succeeds who purifies his own self (i.e. obeys and performs all that Allâh ordered, by following the true Faith of Islâmic Monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds).</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he fails who corrupts his own self (i.e. disobeys what Allâh has ordered, by rejecting the true Faith of Islâmic Monotheism or by following polytheism, or by doing every kind of evil wicked deeds).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Du&#8217;aas referenced in the audio for Purifying the Soul</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allahumma, &#8216;aati nafsi taqwaaha, wa zakkihaa Anta khairu man zakkaahaa, Anta waliyyuhaa wa maulaaha</span><br />
O Allah, grant my soul its piety and purify it, for You are the best to purify it. You are its protector and guardian&#8221;     (Muslim)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abd ur-Rahmaan bin Sa&#8217;dee</strong>, rahimahullaah, said: &#8216;Al-Fattaah has two meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first meaning</span> is: the One who judges between His slaves, and judges between them with His legislation and by rewarding those who obey (Him) and punishing those who disobey (Him) in the dunyaa and aakhira, as His, ta&#8217;aala, statement: <span style="color:#008000;">{Say: &#8216;Our Lord will assemble us all together (on the Day of Resurrection), then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs&#8217;}</span>, and His, ta&#8217;aala, statement: <span style="color:#008000;">{&#8216;Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of those who give judgment}</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The second meaning</span> is: <em>the One who opens all doors of blessings for His slaves</em>. He, ta&#8217;aala, said: {Whatever Allaah grants to people of mercy &#8211; none can withhold it}. He grants benefits of the dunyaa and deen to His slaves, and opens the locks upon hearts for those whom He has favored with His Kindness and Care, and showers (the hearts) with knowledge and understanding from Him and realities of faith that rectifiy their conditions and by which they remain upon the Straight Path; and what&#8217;s more special is that He grants those who love Him and turn to Him knowledge from Him, spiritual conditions, shining lights and true understanding. And likewise <em>He</em> <em>opens for His slaves the doors of rizq (provision) and the paths of the means, and paves the way for provisions and the means to (these provisions) for the muttaqoon (those who fear Him) from where they can&#8217;t imagine, and gives the mutawakkiloon (those who put their trust in Him) beyond what they ask and hope for, and makes easy for them affairs that are difficult, and opens for them doors that are closed</em>.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>“Al-Qadeer, al-Qaadir, al-Muqtadir – (the All-Powerful)”</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd ur-Razzaaq al-Badr</strong> (hafidhahullaah) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All of these Names are mentioned in the Qur’aan, and the most-mentioned one is al-Qadeer, then al-Qaadir, then al-Muqtadir. And all of them demonstrate that Power is established as an Attribute of Allaah, and that He, subhaanah, has <span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Absolute Power</em></strong></span>; so by His Power He brought the creation into being, and by His Power He gives life and gives death, and will resurrect the slaves for recompense, and He will reward the one who did good for his doing good, and the one who did evil for his doing evil,<em> the One who if He wills something, He says to it: Be – and it is</em>; and <em>by His Power He turns the hearts to whatever He wills</em>, and He guides whoever He wills and leads astray whoever He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to His Absolute Power, no one can compass any of His Knowledge except what He wills to teach him, and due to His Absolute Power, He created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days and no fatigue touched Him; and <em>no one from His creation can make Him incapable</em>, the One whose Power is free from fatigue and inability to do what He wants; and due to His Absolute Power,<em> everything</em> is under His disposal, so whatever He wills will be and whatever He doesn’t will will never be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed for having eemaan (faith) in the Power of Allaah, ‘azza wa jal – which His Names ‘Al-Qadeer, Al-Qaadir, Al-Muqtadir’ demonstrate – there are great effects and blessed fruits that return to the slave in his worldly life and hereafter. Hence, <span style="color:#993300;"><em>part of its blessed fruits is that it strengthens – in the slave – seeking the help of Allaah; and part of its effects is having complete patience and being well-pleased with Allaah</em></span>. Ibn ul-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, said: ‘Whoever fills his heart with <strong>ridhaa</strong> (being pleased) with the <strong>Qadr</strong> (Decree), Allaah will fill his chest with contentment and He will free his heart for loving Him, turning to Him in repentance and putting his trust in Him; and whoever misses his portion of ridhaa, his heart will be filled with the opposite of that, and he will be distracted from what his happiness and success are in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And part of its effects is a person’s safety from the diseases of the hearts such as rancor, envy and the like, because of his belief that <em>all the affairs are by the decree of Allaah</em>, ‘azza wa jal, and that<em> He</em>, subhaanah, is the One who gives His slaves and decrees their provisions for them. So He gives whoever He wills and prevents whoever He wills, as the grace is<em> His Grace</em>, subhaanah, and the gift is<em> His Gift</em>, and<em> this is why it is said about the envious one that he is the enemy of Allaah’s blessing upon His slaves</em>. And part of its effects is always asking Allaah and making a lot of du’aa to Him, because all the affairs are in His Hand.”</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>المُجِيب</strong><strong> </strong> <strong><em>Al-Mujeeb</em></strong> (the Responsive), the One who responds to supplications of those who call upon him wherever they are and whatever situation they are in, no matter how many they are in number and who responds in particular to those who submit to him and those in dire need.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd ur-Razzaaq al-Badr</strong> (hafidhahullaah) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And indeed as a result of having faith in the name of Allaah ‘Al-Mujeeb,’ the slave’s certainty in Allaah strengthens, and his turning to Him and hoping for what is with Him increases, and the disease of despairing from His Mercy departs from him. And how can the Muslim not trust in his Lord, the Most Generous, while in His Hand, subhaanah, is the kingdom of everything. So whatever He wills, will be, at the time that He wills, in the way that He wills, with no addition nor omission, no precedence nor delay; and His decree, subhaanah, is carried out in the heavens, and the earth and what is upon it and what is under it, and in the seas and the air, and in all the parts and atoms of the world. To Him belongs the creation and the command, to Him belongs the kingdom and the praise, to Him belongs the dunyaa and the aakhira.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His Name, ta’aala, ‘Al-Mujeeb’ shows that He, subhaanah, hears the du’aa of those who supplicate, and answers the request of those who ask, and does not disappoint a believer who has called upon Him, and He, subhaanah, loves that the slaves ask Him for all their needs of the deen and dunyaa</span></span>, such as food, drink, clothing and shelter, just as they ask Him for guidance, forgiveness, success, assistance to obey (Him), and the like; and He promised them the response to all of that, no matter how great the request is, how much it is, and how diverse the wishes are; and in this, there is evidence of the absolute power of Allaah, subhaanah, and that His treasures will are not depleted nor diminished by (His) giving, even if He granted the first and the last of the jinn and mankind all that they asked Him, as is in the hadeeth qudsee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah that Allaah, tabaarak wa ta’aala, answers those who supplicate and gives those who ask, and that He, jalla wa ‘alaa, is Shy and Generous, too Generous to turn away the one who calls upon Him or disappoint the one who confides in Him with humility or prevent the one who asks Him.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr <strong>Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah</strong> (d.751) -Rahimullaahsaid:<br />
‘Indeed the Da’wah of the Messengers revolves around three principles:</p>
<p><strong>The first principle</strong>: Knowing your Lord, <span style="color:#666699;">the One being called to by His Names, Sifaat and His Actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second principle</strong>: Knowing the path which will lead to Him and that is His remembrance, being thankful to Him and His worship which is made up of complete love for Him and complete humility for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third principle</strong>: Knowing what they will receive after reaching Him from the blessings of being in the land of His Generosity (Paradise) of which the best and the most magnificent thing will be Allaah being pleased with them and His honouring them and them seeing His Face the most High, and Allaah’s Salaam upon them and Him talking to them.’</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"></div>
<div><strong>Shaykh AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr</strong> said:</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are many <em>Ayaat</em> which come in the Qur’aan with the command to learn this noble knowledge of <em>Tawheed</em> and to have a concern with this great principle.</p>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ  &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#0000ff;">then know that Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</span> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 209]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ&gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">and know that Allaah is All-Aware of everything</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 231]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ&gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#0000ff;">know that Allaah is All-Seer of what you do</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 233]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">And know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 235]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ&gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#0000ff;">and know that Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 244]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#0000ff;">And know that Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), and Worthy of all praise</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 267]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; اعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Know that Allaah is Severe in punishment and that Allaah is Oft­-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Maidah: 98]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَوْلَاكُمْ نِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">then know that Allaah is your <em>Maulâ </em>(Patron, Lord, Protector and Supporter, etc.), (what) an Excellent <em>Maulâ, </em>and (what) an Excellent Helper!</span>&gt;&gt; [Anfal: 40]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">and know that Allaah is with <em>Al-Muttaqeen</em></span>.&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 194]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُ &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">And know that Allaah knows what is in your minds, so fear Him</span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 235]</p></blockquote>
<p>Allaah said: &lt;&lt; فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ  &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">So know that <em>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)</span>&gt;&gt; [Muhammad: 19]</p></blockquote>
<p>There are nearly thirty <em>Ayaat</em> with these meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the mention of Allaah, regarding His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and His <em>Sifaat</em> in the Qur’aan then there are many. There cannot be a comparison of His mentioning about His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and <em>Sifaat</em> with any other topic, since His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and <em>Sifaat</em> are the greatest thing mentioned in the Qur’aan and the best thing and the most exalted.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong> (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Qur’aan has more of a mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> and His Actions, than the mention of food, drink and marriage in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Ayaat</em> which include the mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> are greater in amount than the <em>Ayaat</em> of the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why the greatest <em>Ayaah</em> in the Qur’aan is the <em>Ayaat-ul-Kursi</em> which consists of the Names and <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah.  As is established in the authentic hadeeth which is narrated by Muslim from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; that he said to Ubayy bin Ka’ab:</p>
<p>‘Do you know which <em>Ayah</em> in the Book of Allaah is the greatest?’</p>
<p>He answered: &lt;&lt; اللَّهُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ    &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Allaah! <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> patted him on his chest with his hand and said: ‘Knowledge congratulates you Abu al-Mundhir.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the best <em>Soorah</em> is the <em>Soorah Umm al-Qur’aan</em> (Al-Faatihah), as is established in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed bin al-Mu’ala in Bukhari. [This wording is by Imaam Ahmad in ‘Musnad’ with an authentic chain]</p>
<p>The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p>In this <em>Soorah</em> there is a greater mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> than the mention of the Last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established in the Saheeh of Bukhari from the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from more than one narration that <em>Soorah</em> Al-Ikhlaas &lt;&lt; قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ  &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Say: ‘He is Allaah, (the) One. &gt;&gt;  is equivalent to a third of the Qur’aan, and it is established in the Saheeh of Bukhari that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> gave good news to the one who used to read this <em>Soorah</em> when he said: Indeed I love this <em>Soorah</em> because it contains the <em>Sifaat</em> of <em>ar-Rahman</em>; so due to that Allaah loved this person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth explains that Allaah loves the one who loves the remembrance of the <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah Subhaanahu wa Ta’ala, and this matter is a detailed one.’</p>
<p>[Taken from ‘<em>Fiqh</em> of <em>al-‘Asmaa</em> <em>al-Husna’</em> p.8-10]</p>
